"To extend the life of your tires, how often should you rotate them?"	"The tires on wheels with power supplied to them will wear down more quickly. Regular tire rotations distribute that wear evenly across all four tires. For those who drive about 15,000 miles per year, that means rotating your tires at least twice per year (every 5,000 to 8,000 miles)."
How can low tire pressure negatively affect your driving?	"Your tires should be kept at the factory-recommended pressure denoted on the walls of each. This ensures an ideal point of contact of the tread to the road so the tires don?t drag excessively, which can wear them out prematurely and use more fuel. Check tire pressure once per month after the vehicle has been sitting overnight."
How often should you change your oil and oil filter?	"Your engine?s oil keeps the pistons lubricated and rids the engine of contaminants and impurities. Over time, as it gets dirty and loses volume, it needs to be replaced. Engine and oil technology have improved over the years, allowing most modern vehicles to go far beyond 3,000 miles before they need an oil change. Check your owner?s manual and talk with your mechanic about your driving habits to develop an ideal interval for your vehicle."
"Your car?s air filter should be inspected for signs of wear (e.g., oil or water soaked, leaking, torn or restricted) after every oil change, but how often should it be replaced even if it?s not failing?"	"In modern vehicles, a clogged air filter will not significantly affect fuel efficiency, but it can mean a significant decrease in acceleration (up to 11 percent). Replacing it once per year can ensure a vehicle?s top performance, but many can last for up to 30,000 miles."
"If you don?t know where to start in creating a maintenance schedule, where?s the best place to find specific recommendations for YOUR vehicle?"	"Although others may be informed and fully capable of advising you on your vehicle, the most concrete, reliable information can be found in your owner?s manual. Others? expertise may be useful to tweak your maintenance schedule based on your driving habits or environment, but the factory recommendations are the best starting place."
"When should you replace the belts (V-belts or serpentine) that power your alternator, water pump, power steering and cooling fans?"	"When the belts look greasy or glazed, have excessive cracks, or contain splits and chunking, You can check the belts just by popping the hood of your car. They run along the exterior of the engine and look like large rubber bands stretched around various-sized pulleys. Rubber degrades naturally over time, so examine them for excessive wear. If you hear a high-pitched squealing when your engine is running, then the belts might be slipping and need to be replaced."
"With all of those caps under the hood, which one do you pour windshield wiper fluid in?"	"Adding windshield washer fluid to the wrong reservoir can have disastrous results. Sometimes the antifreeze overflow tank and wiper fluid tank can be quite close to each other on cramped engine compartments. This proximity makes it easy to pour into the incorrect location. Should something like that happen, a full coolant flush should be done to prevent the detergents in the wiper fluid from harming the cooling system."

"Pick the best response. If your car manufacturer recommends regular gasoline (87 octane), you will get better performance if you use premium gas (92 octane)."	"False, experts say that using premium gas when the vehicle does not require it is like throwing your money away and will not improve vehicle performance."

Do not begin disassembly or testing until you have narrowed down the problem area. 2. Analyze the schematic Look up the schematic for the problem circuit. Determine how the circuit is supposed to work by tracing the current paths from the power feed through the circuit components to ground. If several circuits fail at the same time, the fuse or ground is a likely cause. Based on the symptoms and your understanding of the circuit operation, identify one or more possible causes of the problem. 3. Isolate the problem by testing the circuit. Make circuit tests to check the diagnosis you made in step 2. Keep in mind that a logical, simple procedure is the key to efficient troubleshooting. Test for the most likely cause of failure first. Try to make tests at points that are easily accessible. 4. Fix the problem Once the specific problem is identified, make the repair. Be sure to use proper tools and safe procedures. 5. Make sure the circuit works Turn on all components in the repaired circuit in all modes to make sure you've fixed the entire problem. If the problem was a blown fuse, be sure to test all of the circuits on the fuse. Make sure no new problems turn up and the original problem does not recur"

(If the SMARTRA3 is learnt, the SMARTRA3 compares Encrypted Code transmitted by the ECM with Encrypted Code stored in EEPROM and transmits the (in)correct Encrypted Code message to ECM) (4) If the SMARTRA3 is learnted normally or the Encrypted Code of the registered SMARTRA3 is same as the ECM, the ECM begins operation the Transponder Learning. (5) If the learning of the first transponder, the ECM stores the Encrypted Code in its EEPROM and converts state into learnt state. 2. The SMARTRA3 learning : (1) starts with EMS request of PIN from scanner through the key teaching procedure. (2) is possible in case that the status of SMARTAR is ""virgin"" or ""neutral "". (3) In case that the SMARTRA3 is ""learnt"", the SMARTRA3 will transmits the information if PIN inputted from scanner is same as the PIN in SMARTRA3. (4) is possible regardless of key status. 3. The sequence of the SMARTRA3 confirms are as follows. (1) After communication with the SMARTRA3, the ECM transmits the random number with requirement of the TP ID information. (2) The SMARTRA3 encryptes the random number and transmits the result(Encrypted Random Number) to the ECM with TP ID information. (3) The ECM compares the result transmitted from the SMARTRA3 with the result calculated by ECM. And If result are coincided with each other; the ECS concludes the valid confirmation of the SMARTRA3."

How To BRAKE BOOSTER OPERATING TEST	"1. Run the engine for one or two minutes, and then stop it. If the pedal depresses fully the first time but gradually becomes higher when depressed succeeding times, the booster is operating properly, if the pedal height remains unchanged, the booster is defective. 2. With the engine stopped, step on the brake pedal several times. Then step on the brake pedal and start the engine. If the pedal moves downward slightly, the booster is in good condition. If there is no change, the booster is defective. Page 6 of 228 https://www.hyundaitechinfo.com/viewer/toc_print.asp?vehicletype=Passenger&mfrc... 12/03/2013 3. With the engine running, step on the brake pedal and then stop the engine. Hold the pedal depressed for 30 seconds. If the pedal height does not change, the booster is in good condition, if the pedal rises, the booster is defective. If the above three tests are okay, the booster performance can be determined as good. Even if one of the above three tests is not okay, check the check valve, vacuum hose and booster for defect."

description of ESC	"Optimum driving safety now has a name : ESC, the Electronic Stability Control. ESC recognizes critical driving conditions, such as emergency reactions in dangerous situations, and stabilizes the vehicle by wheel-individual braking and engine control intervention. ESC adds a further function known as Active Yaw Control (AYC) to the ABS, TCS, EBD and ESC functions. Whereas the ABS/TCS function controls wheel slip during braking and acceleration and, thus, mainly intervenes in the longitudinal dynamics of the vehicle, active yaw control stabilizes the vehicle about its vertical axis. This is achieved by wheel individual brake intervention and adaptation of the momentary engine torque with no need for any action to be taken by the driver. ESC essentially consists of three assemblies : the sensors, the electronic control unit and the actuators. Of course, the stability control feature works under all driving and operating conditions. Under certain driving conditions, the ABS/TCS function can be activated simultaneously with the ESC function in response to a command by the driver. In the event of a failure of the stability control function, the basic safety function, ABS, is still maintained."
DESCRIPTION OF ESC CONTROL	"ESC system includes ABS/EBD, TCS and AYC (Active yaw control) function. ABS/EBD function : The ECU changes the active sensor signal (current shift) coming from the four wheel sensors to the square waveform.By using the input of above signals, the ECU calculates the vehicle speed and the acceleration & deceleration of the four wheels.And, the ECU judges whether the ABS/EBD should be actuated or not. TCS function prevents the wheel slip of drive direction by adding the brake pressure and engine torque reduction via CAN communication.TCS function uses the wheel speed sensor signal to determine the wheel slip as far as ABS function. AYC function prevents unstable maneuver of the vehicle. To determine the vehicle maneuver, AYC function uses the maneuver sensor signals(Yaw Rate Sensor, Lateral Acceleration Sensor, Steering Wheel Angle Sensor).If vehicle maneuver is unstable (Over Steer or Under Steer), AYC function applies the brake pressure on certain wheel, and send engine torque reduction signal by CAN. After the key-on, the ECU continually diagnoses the system failure. (self-diagnosis)If the system failure is detected, the ECU informs driver of the system failure through the BRAKE/ABS/ESC warning lamp. (fail-safe warning)"

Drive Shaft Oil Seal	"Replace 1. Disconnect the drive shaft from the transaxle. (see ""DS"" group) 2. Using a flat-tip screwdriver, remove the oil seal. Page 4 of 25 https://www.hyundaitechinfo.com/viewer/toc_print.asp?vehicletype=Passenger&mfrc... 12/03/2013 3. Using the special tool(09452-21200), tap the drive shaft oil seal into the transaxle."
Brakes	The automatic transaxle (A4CF2) uses the low and reverse brake and the second brake. The low and reverse brake is fixed by the low and reverse annulus gear and overdrive planetary carrier. The overdrive sun gear is held on the transaxle case by the second brake. - The disc type return spring is applied to the low and reverse brake and it minimizes the slip of the friction material from the uniform spring operation power to improve the durability and reduce the length.
Clutch	"The multiple clutches and the one way clutch are used as the transaxle device. The retainer of each clutch is composed of the precision sheet metal parts to realize the productivity and the light weight. The hydraulic centrifugal oil pressure balance device places inside the clutch assembly. Generally the oil remained in the piston oil pressure chamber pushes the piston by the centrifugal force. But to prevent the piston from being pushed, the oil filled in between the piston and the return spring retainer occurs the centrifugal force and both of the power is offset so that the piston don't move. In result, it improves the durability and the shift control ability."
Underdrive Clutch	The driving force of input shaft is delivered to the underdrive sun gear. The operating oil pressure in the underdrive clutch components operates between the piston and the retainer and pushes the piston to the clutch discs to deliver the driving force from the retainer to the hub.
Reverse clutch and overdrive clutch	The reverse clutch is engaged at the reverse and delivers the driving force of input shaft to the reverse sun gear. The overdrive clutch is engaged at the 3rd and 4th speed and delivers the driving force of input shaft to the overdrive planetary carrier and the low and reverse annulus gear. The operating oil pressure of the reverse clutch operates between the reverse clutch retainer and overdrive clutch retainer and it has the whole overdrive clutch moved to deliver into the hub via retainer.
Parking System	The parking system for A4CF2 model is the cam type. The roller type installed to the existing new generation AT needs the support to move the roller when operating the parking system and is so complicated. But the cam type for A4CF2 model doesn't need the support and the structure is simply. It only needs the guide to prevent from moving the cam idly.
Hydraulic Control System	"The VFS (Variable Force Solenoid) installed in the valve body is applied to transaxle(A4CF2). VFS varies the line pressure from 4.5bar to 10.5bar according to throttle open angle and shift range to improve the fuel consumption and shift ability. And the reducing valve which is installed in the valve body makes the solenoid control pressure using the reducing pressure instead of the line pressure like the HIVEC transaxle. The material of spool valve in the valve body is changed from the steel to aluminum to reduce the oil leakage by the thermal expansion between the valve body and spool valve at the high temperature. The switch valve, the solenoid valve and the fail safe valve are operated to drive the vehicle at the 3rd speed and reverse even thought the malfunction of the electronic control parts occur."
Transaxle Fluid Level	"1. Drive the vehicle until the fluid reaches normal operating temperature [70~80øC(158~176øF)]. 2. Place the vehicle on a level surface. 3. Move the gear selector lever through all gear positions. This will fill the torque converter with trans fluid. Set the selector lever to the ""N"" (Neutral) position. 4. Before removing the oil level gauge, wipe all contaminants from around the oil level gauge. Then take out the oil level gauge and check the condition of the fluid. If the fluid smells as if it is burning, it means that the fluid has been contaminated by fine particles from the bushes and friction materials, a transmission overhaul may be necessary. 5. Check that the fluid level is in the ""HOT"" mark on the oil level gauge. If fluid level is low, add automatic transaxle fluid until the level reaches the ""HOT"" mark. Automatic transaxle fluid : DIAMOND ATF SP-III, SK ATF SP-III Automatic transaxle fluid capacity: 6.6liter(6.9 US qt, 5.81lmp.qt) Low fluid level can cause a variety of abnormal conditions because it allows the pump to take in air along with fluid. Air trapped in the hydraulic system forms bubbles, which are compressible. Therefore, pressures will be erratic, causing delayed shifting, slipping clutches and brakes, etc. Improper filling can also raise fluid level too high. When the transaxle has too much fluid, gears churn up foam and cause the same conditions which occur with low fluid level, resulting in accelerated deterioration of automatic transaxle fluid. In either case, air bubbles can cause overheating, and fluid oxidation, which can interfere with normal valve, clutch, and brake operation. Foaming can also result in fluid escaping from the transaxle vent where it may be mistaken for a leak. Page 9 of 148 https://www.hyundaitechinfo.com/viewer/toc_print.asp?vehicletype=Passenger&mfrc... 12/03/2013 If you have a fluid changer, use this changer to replace the fluid. If you do not have a fluid replace the fluid by the following procedure. This test measures the maximum engine speed when the select lever is at the ""D"" or ""R"" position and the torque converter stalls to test the operation of the torque converter, starter motor and one-way clutch operation and the holding performance of the 6. Insert the oil level gauge securely. When new, automatic transmission fluid should be red, The red dve is added so the assembly plant can identify it as transmission fluid and distinguish it from engine oil or antifreeze. The red dve, which is not an indicator of fluid quality, is not permanent. As the vehicle is driven the transmission fluid will begin to look darker. The color may eventually appear light brown."

Does Servicing My Car with an Independent Mechanic Void My Warranty?	"NO!ÿThe law states that any licensed mechanic, fitting high quality parts according to the manufacturers? specifications will maintain your new car warranty.ÿ"
How Often Should I Service My Car?	"5,000km, 7,500km, 10,000km, 15,000km..? Not all cars are the same, so always go by your vehicle?s manual. However, we?d recommend a minimum of once a year, despite how often you may or may not drive your car."
I Don?t Drive all That Often. Why Do I Need to Service my Car?	"Many things in your vehicle break down naturally over time, including yourÿoilÿandÿfilters. Getting these replaced once a year will ensure your vehicle is ready to be driven whenever you need it."
How Do I Know When My Brakes Need Replacing?	"Brakesÿare one of those things people consistently get overcharged on, with many workshops replacing brakes too soon and too often in the pursuit of a quick buck."
How Often Should I Check My Oil?	"For most cars, we recommend checking yourÿengine oilÿevery couple of months. Modern turbo charged engines are actually designed to use oil at a far higher rate, meaning a monthly check of oil is recommended. To check your oil, use the dipstick, wipe it clean and push it back in to measure the level. If it?s looking low, top it up with the correct grade of oil."
What Happens If I Miss a Service?	"Don?t fret! Just like the workout you missed, we can get you back on track and your car back into a healthy cycle. While missing a service isn?t ideal, the best thing you can do is to address the elephant in the room and get your service done ASAP. The longer you leave it, the more likely you are to encounter problems with your car down the line."
What Pressure Should My Tyres be at?	"The best place to find this information is on the side of your tyre sticker or in your vehicle handbook (usually on the inside of the driver?s door pillar). It can be a little difficult to read, but your tyre sticker will always advise on the correct PSI for the road conditions and driving style the tyre is supposed to be used for."
What Should I do if I Get an Engine Warning Light on My Dash?	"If you can?t find any duct tape to hide the light, we recommend addressing the issue immediately. Check Engine lights can come on for a wide variety of reasons, some more seriously than others. Like most reputable mechanics,ÿSparesboxÿServiceÿcan use aÿcomputer system to diagnose any engine issueÿthat will be causing the light."
What Kind of Oil Should I Put in My Car?	"There?s aÿhuge range of oilÿout there, and it can all seem a little daunting at times. As a rule, always go by your vehicle?s handbook to ensure that you?re getting the right grade of oil for your car?s engine to perform at its best. After this, it?s simply a matter of getting the best quality oil you can afford."
Does the Quality of Parts Really Matter?	Absolutely! Many workshops offset the cost of providing cheaper services by using low-quality parts that are far inferior to what you?d get from either the manufacturer or a more renowned mechanic.
Are the Parts Sparesbox Uses as Good as the Dealership?	"Always. Sparesbox has established relationships with suppliers that we KNOW manufacture parts toÿOriginal Equipment (OE) standards. This means that every partÿSparesbox either sells onlineÿor fits as part of a service has been tested and manufactured by the leading suppliers, designed toÿperform perfectly in your vehicle."
What Does ?OE? and ?OEM? Mean?	"?OEM? (Original Equipment Manufacturer)ÿrefers to parts that have been sourced either directly from the manufacturer of your car, or the company that supplies the factory parts for that manufacturer."
How Do I know How Much a Service Should Cost?	"Good question! If you have no obvious issues that need fixing, we can usually break down your services into two key brackets; Basic & Logbook. As you would expect, basic services are the least costly,ÿusually only consisting of anÿoilÿandÿoil filterÿchange. This service is only recommended for older vehicles where cost is the main decision factor."
How often should I check my tire pressure?	"Once a month, unless there?s a drastic change in the outside temperature."
When should I change my transmission fluid?	"Every 50,000 -ÿ100,000 kilometres (90,000 for a manual), or every two years. With intense use, it could be sooner."
 Why do my dashboard signal lights sometimes blink faster?	You likely have a bulb that has burnt out or has a faulty connection.
What?s the difference between oversteering and understeering?	Oversteering is when your car turns more than you intended; understeering is less.
What does the exclamation mark light on my dashboard mean?	An exclamation mark inside a U means you have at least one tire with low air pressure.
Can I switch to synthetic oil or a different grade?	"Switching to synthetic oil (or even back to conventional oil) is typically not a problem. However, it?s best to consult your vehicle?s owner manual for a recommendation on the exact type of oil you should use."
Why do I hear a squeaking noise when I?m braking?	It means your brake pads are wearing out. Brake pads apply pressure to the brake rotors to stop your vehicle?s wheels when braking.
How can I save money on gas?	"If you?re not in the market for a hybrid or electric vehicle, there are apps that will let you know where to find the cheapest gas. Points from select loyalty cards can also be redeemed instantly towards gas purchases."
What is hydroplaning?	"Hydroplaning happens when a car?s tires come into contact with more water than they can dispel, creating a barrier of water between the roadway and the tires. The car then loses traction and a loss of braking and steering control."
What is the difference between a 4-cylinder and a 6-cylinder engine?	6-cylinders are capable of more horsepower and better performance and are typically used in cars with bigger engines. 4-cylinder vehicles are more fuel-efficient and cheaper.
Why is my check engine light on?	A check engine light can indicate a number of potential problems ranging from very minor (such as the gas cap not being securely tightened) to much more serious (like a catalytic converter that needs replacing).
Isÿusing premium fuel better for my car?	"Only if your vehicle has a high-performance engine for which premium fuel is recommended. Otherwise, unleaded fuel is perfectly fine and will save you precious pennies at the pump."
How To Open 	"In fact, many of today?s higher-performance vehicles are designed with an internal sensor that will adjust the engine?s compression ratio based on the type of fuel that it detects. The best thing to do is consult your owner?s manual as it will almost always include the type of recommended fuel. ÿ"
What about synthetic oil?	Drivers who generally do not travel long distances can benefit from synthetic oil because conventional oil may not get hot enough during a short trip to effectively burn off engine impurities. Drivers who live in cold winter climates and drivers who use their vehicles to tow or haul heavy loads can also benefit from synthetic oil.
Do my windshield wiper blades need to be replaced?	"More than likely, the answer is yes. It?s recommended that windshield wiper blades be replaced every six to 12 months, but most people do not replace them with such frequency."
Do my tires need to be rotated?	"Your owner?s manual will tell you how often you should rotate your tires, but it will likely be in the neighborhood of 4,000 to 8,000 miles. In other words, it?s recommended for most people to rotate their tires every six months or every other time they have an oil change."
Do you have experience with cars like mine?	"While it?s a common belief that mechanics can work on every vehicle that enters the auto repair shop, the truth is that some can and others specialize in some makes. Older and/or less commonly found vehicles are often repaired by specialized mechanics. Even if a mechanic is unable to work on your vehicle, ask if they can recommend a different repair shop."
How much will the diagnostics cost?	"This is like first asking your doctor how much the tests will cost before you get a diagnosis of why you feel sick. While it may seem like an odd question, because you?ve gone to the trouble of taking your car to the mechanic, and you obviously want it to be repaired, you don?t want to pay too much for the tests. But if it?s too high, it?s a good opportunity to shop around for better prices."
"Can I get a written, out-the-door estimate?"	"Always ask for a written estimate of the cost of the repairs. Parts, labor, taxes and any discounts should be included. Always give them a phone number to reach you to approve another repair that might be needed, and make sure they give you an estimate of the additional cost."
What could happen if I don?t have the repair done?	"It?s true that some repairs do not require immediate attention, but others should not be ignored or postponed. Ask a mechanic if your particular repair needs prompt attention or if it could be handled within a few thousand miles."
What repair options do I have?	"The majority of vehicle issues can be addressed with a variety of approaches. Unfortunately, some mechanics are trying to drive customers to the most expensive ? or complex, which often means expensive ? repair. Ask the mechanic about all possible solutions and explain them in depth. That way, you ?re going to have a full picture of the options and be able to make the best decision."
Can you show me what?s wrong?	"If a mechanic insists that you need extra work done, ask them to show you the wear and tear on the part that they recommend to replace. If you ask to see the holes when you say that the car needs a new exhaust and the mechanical balks, then you should be wary."
How did you fix the problem?	"This question is a great way to start building a personal relationship with a specific mechanic. It gives them a chance to explain, in technical terms, what the problem was, how it was discovered, and what methods or how it was repaired. Plus, once the relationship is started, you can have the same mechanical work on the vehicle every time ? this means that you?ll learn any particular features that the vehicle may have and immediately know how to handle it."
Do you offer a warranty?	"Depending on the repair shop, you may receive a warranty or guarantee for the work performed. The guarantee is the promise that specific criteria, such as specific repairs, will be met. If the repair had failed, for example, the mechanic or shop would have repaired or replaced the work. Many guarantees are structured in the same way, but vary in the choice of words used."
When will the repairs be done?	"Get an idea of when your car will be ready to pick up, and make sure you?re called to approve any extra repairs beyond those that you?ve already approved. You ?re going to want to know how long you ?re going to be without your car, so you can make other accommodations. Also, ask if they can give you a ride to your home or work while your car is in the shop."
What repairs do I have coming up?	"While you?re not supposed to expect your mechanic to predict the future, they should have a good idea of the potential repairs and major maintenance costs you?ve come up with."

"Regarding the above referenced project, does the design utilize HDPE products other than corrugated HDPE? Also, do you have a current plan holders list?"	"The project does not specify and HDPE products, other than a Cetco GCL clay liner cover and drainage layer product. The plan holders list will be posted on the county website after the mandatory pre-bid meeting."
Can the County furnish the name of the Company who has performed the methane well drilling in the past?	Recovery Drilling Services. The web says their permanently closed.We recommend contracting with a local foundation pier installation driller or similar for the vent well installation.
"Item #5 on the Bid Sheet (GCL Installation) shows 250,000 Sq Ft. However, when doing our own takeoffs, we came up with closer to 300,000 Sq Ft. This additional square footage takes into account the additional GCL material required for anchor trench and also GCL material waste for overlapping. Can we utilize the DrainTube 300P, as the geocomposite layer, since it was recommended by CETCO, in-lieu of utilizing CETCO?s Tendrain Geocomposite?"	The RFP Addendum issued 8-24-21 has updated cover area estimates to account for overlap and anchor trenches. The DrainTube 300P product is acceptable. Other similar commercially available Geotextiles and drainage layer products are also acceptable if they meet the purpose of the project and have demonstrated successful installation and function.

Timing ? For quarterly submissions is NCUA asking for 1 Member file per quarter or for 3 (one for each month end)?	"The revised membership template includes a snapshot date. The member file, like other files, are expected to be submitted once a quarter, one file for each month."
: Will NCUA verify what types of loans they expect to be classified as Hybrid vs Variable? With these changes we still don?t see a great option for our 5/5 ARMs. Would recommend having ARM or something that represents set periodic adjustments.	ARM should be treated as hybrid.
": What is intended by each of these and how do they differ? DATE_LINE_CLOSED, CREDIT_CLOSED_FLAG and CREDIT_FROZEN_FLAG."	"DATE_LINE_CLOSED is specifically for line of credit and is the date the line is closed to any future charges, in particular in the case of a credit card where the borrower can no longer use the card, but still has a positive balance to be repaid. CREDIT_CLOSED_FLAG indicates if the draw period ends. CREDIT_FROZEN_FLAG indicates CU has frozen the line of credit against further draws on a temporary basis, perhaps due to delinquency or loss of collateral."
"There are three fields on the version 3 templates for current files submitted for Real Estate, Auto, Credit Card and Other Consumer. The fields are CONFORM_PARTICIPATION_AGENT, PARTICIPATION_RATIO, and BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_FLAG. How should we populate these if business/commercial loans will be moved to the new CRE and Non?RE Commercial templates?"	"In general, all business/commercial loans should migrate into the new CRE and Non?CRE templates. BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_FLAG would be marked as ""N"" for consumer loans. Any other fields that are not applicable would be null. Participation loan data should be completed for any loan that is a participation, whether the loan is a commercial or retail loan.

It should not be the actual loan or account ID, nor any Personally Identifiable information (PII)."
"Should MEMBER_ID be the same across all data snapshots (RE, Consumer Lending, Shares, Loss Severity, etc.)?"	Correct. The tokenized MEMBER_ID remains the same for the same member cross different product types.
"We do not include participation loans as part of the quarterly submissions. Is it ok to leave CONFORM_PARTICIPATION_AGENT as NULL even though the documentation says ?one of the whole number in the confirmed entries? must be used (1 ? Bank, 2 ? Credit Union, 3 ? Fintech, 4 ? Other)? We can definitely set this field to 4 for the entire data set, but we do not want to give NCUA the wrong impression that our existing RE and Consumer Loan datasets are participation loans."	"All loans Held For Investment (HFI) and reported on the Loan and Leases page of the Call Report should be reported in the loan level files. Participation loans should be reported in the files that best matches their product and collateral type. If a loan is not a participation, please leave the CONFORM_PARTICIPATION_AGENT field as NULL. Please also refer to ""Data Template Overview.pdf"" for further instructions on loan participation, which is published at ""https://www.ncua.gov/regulation?supervision/regulatory?compliance? resources/capital?planning?stress?testing?resources""."

"The age (in years) of the customer in years as of the account open date : what should we do with the following scenario? 1) Age returns negative because the Prime Name Birthday is for the trust account (Example: 0002680977 S90 share open date is 2015, while the prime name birthday for the trust is 2016. ) 2) Age returns negative because a younger Prime Name may have acquired an older acct (Example 0014111019 S90 share opened in 1964, while prime name birthday is in 1980. )"	"You outlined clear cases where the age in years at the account open may be negative. Please report these as negative ages (in years). Note that we would expect the number of cases where the age at account open is negative to be small relative to the overall population. Our data quality validations will flag these at outliers, in order to raise awareness to less usual cases in the data."
Number of Checks Cleared in the Month (7029): should this include both deposit and withdrawals?	The number of checks cleared in the month should reflect withdrawals only.
Shall we include the employee loans within the submission?	Please include the employee loans in the submission if they are part of the CU loan portfolio and are included in the balances reported in the Call Report.
Collateral_type (5004): the mapping on tab CC states to use Secure codeÿ?ÿis this just for share secured Visas?	"COLLATERAL_TYPE is a free text field designed to capture your best internal description of the collateral for a given loan. If a loan does not have collateral (e.g., SECURED_FLAG = ?N?) then we expect to receive a NULL value. So if you only have certain credit card products that are secured, we would only expect COLLATERAL_TYPE to be provided for those records (this should correspond to the records having SECURED_FLAG = ?Y?)."
Collateral type (5004)ÿ?ÿThe detailed collateral information used to secure the loanÿ?ÿ Example: In house deposit balance. How to populate this field?	"COLLATERAL_TYPE is a free text field designed to capture your best internal description of the collateral for a given loan. If a loan does not have collateral (e.g., SECURED_FLAG = ?N?) then we expect to receive a NULL value."
"Field 7011 Conformed Modification Type, requirement said to choose one of the pre? defined values below. What if multiple exist? E.g. if a loan had both 2 and 3, do we enter 23? 1ÿ?ÿForbearance/Deferment/Extension 2ÿ?ÿPayment Reduction 3ÿ?ÿPrincipal Reduction 4ÿ?ÿLoan Type Change"	"Our past guidance on the topic has been that if principal reduction is part of the modification, use conformed value 3. Otherwise, use conformed value 2 if a payment reduction was part of the modification."
CONFORM_BEHAVIOR_TYPE in credit card template. How do you define revolver vs. transactor?	"ONES prefers a CU uses its internal definition of revolver and transactor. Some CUs have responded that they do not group their card portfolios as transactors or revolvers. A transactor need not pay off the entire balance each month, nor a revolver always carry a balance. Where the line is drawn is based on your internal policy. As for time period, we do not have a minimum time threshold, but you should include at least a couple of months in order to establish a trend. The mix category was included in case a CU has an additional category or is unable to slot a card member easily into one category or the other."
CONFORM_LOAN_PURPOSE in Other consumer loans. How do we choose for refinance?	"Please classify a refinance as a ?2? or debt consolidation. While this is not a perfect match, ONES prefers to keep the ?1? Purchase option as only purchase transactions"
"AMORT_TERMÿ?ÿAmortization Term in Months, is this the full term or remaining term of the loan?"	"This field is for the complete amortization term of the loan, not remaining."
Student Loanÿ?ÿCONFORM_PRODUCT_TYPE what would be classified as Other ?	We are reserving ?Other? in case there are unique student loan products that we wish to separately categorize from the more traditional private student loan product.
Student Loanÿ?ÿCHARGE_OFF_AMT does this include interest paid to principal before the loan is charged off?	"If this is referring to the interest owed that is reversed as part of the charge?off / non? accrual status, then yes, please include the interest in the total charge?off amount since the interest was not paid per the contractual obligation. If this refers to a separate situation, please provide more detail."
Mortgageÿ?ÿSALES_PRICE for refis what are you expecting to see in this field?	"In the case of a refinance, please leave the SALES_PRICE field as NULL."
COMMERCIALÿ?ÿORIG_FICO; Is the credit score referring to the borrowing entity or principal holder?	This is the credit score for the individual borrower/holder.
"COMMERCIALÿ?ÿORIG_FINAN_INFO_DATE; If there are multiple properties and they each have different dates, what date should we report?"	Please use the latest date among all properties.
COMMERCIALÿ?ÿPROFIT_RATIO; How does NCUA define profit ratio for construction projects? Does profitability on construction project refer to profitability for borrower or CU?	"Please follow CU internal calculation on profit ratio. This ratio is based the borrower's project, not CU profit."
COMMERCIALÿ?ÿAMORT_TERM; Should we report amortization term based on the original note? Or remaining amortization?	Please report the amortization term in the original note.
"NBR_TIMES_MOD; 1) How does NCUA define a modification? Is the request for modified interest rate trying to identify where we have given relief for loans that have gone through hardship? 2) If the INT RATE changes through a modification of loan terms, should that be reported as a MOD_INT_RATE or a CURR_INT_RATE? Once a loan is modified, we currently report it as a CURR_INT_RATE."	"Please refer to the conformed valued in CONFORM_MOD_TYPE for NCUA definition on modification. When a loan is modified, please report the modified interest rate in both MOD_INT_RATE and CURR_INT_RATE."
"COMMERCIALÿ?ÿPOST_MOD_MAT_DATE; Is this request to identify where we have given relief due to hardship? Can the Modified Maturity Date be listed in the Current Maturity? If we report as a different field, should we only report in the month that the loan was modified or is this a static field?"	"MATURITY_DATE filed is static, referring to the original maturity date. Please put new maturity date in POST_MOD_MAT_DATE"
"COMMERCIALÿ?ÿYIELD_MAINT_END_DATE; Is this reporting requirement the same as Row 49 ""Prepayment Lock?out End Date""? If not, how do they differ?"	"A lockout period occurs when a commercial real estate loan is not allowed to be repaid in full. The loan terms will not allow for prepayment in any form, and the borrower must wait until this period expires if they want to pay off the loan prior to maturity. During yield maintenance period, the borrower is allowed to make prepayment with the penalty stated in the loan terms."
"A lockout period occurs when a commercial real estate loan is not allowed to be repaid in full. The loan terms will not allow for prepayment in any form, and the borrower must wait until this period expires if they want to pay off the loan prior to maturity. During yield maintenance period, the borrower is allowed to make prepayment with the penalty stated in the loan terms."	The Field Name and Description for CONFORM_REFRESH_APPR_TYPE are incorrect in the templates. The correct ones are as follows: Field Nameÿ?ÿRefreshed Appraisal Method; Descriptionÿ?ÿ The method used to establish the value of real property securing the loan during ongoing loan appraisal/review. Please report the appraisal method your CU uses during the ongoing loan appraisal/review process.
"COMMERCIALÿ?ÿPROP_CITY PROP_STATE PROP_ZIP_CODE; If we have multiple properties and they are located in different cities, which City, State, Zip Code do we report?"

"COMMERCIALÿ?ÿCURR_BAL; If a participation loan, do we report the whole loan balance or the CU Balance?"	Correct. Use CU owned balance for participating loans.
COMMERCIALÿ?ÿBKRPT_FLAG; Do we report if bankruptcy during term of the loan or at any point during the sponsor's history? Do we report for Borrower only or the Guarantor?	"Only report bankruptcy during the term of the loan, on borrowing entity or individual borrower, not guarantor."
"COMMERCIALÿ?ÿCONFORM_MOD_TYPE; What if modification includes a combination of different actions, how do we report?"	"If principal reduction is part of the modification, use conformed value 3ÿ?ÿÿPrincipal Reduction . If modification includes both 1ÿ?ÿForbearance/Deferment/Extension and 2ÿ?ÿ Payment Reduction, use conformed value 2ÿ?ÿPayment Reduction."
AMORTIZATION_TERM and ORIG_LOAN_TERM ? Can you please explain what the difference is between these two fields?	"For most loans these fields will be the same, but for certain balloon and commercial loans there may be a difference. For example, in the commercial loan industry it is not uncommon to have a 20 year amortization period and a 5 year loan term. This combination results in lower payments during the repayment period and a balloon payment due at the end of 5 years."
CURR_CREDIT_GRADE ? We do not re?grade loans after origination. Would you prefer us to leave CURR_CREDIT_GRADE as a NULL value or should we set it equal to ORIG_CREDIT_GRADE?	Please provide a NULL value (double pipes ||) if a CU does not re?grade loans after origination.
Shall we report charge?offs related to negative shares and overdraft balances?	"Yes, please include such losses in the Loss Severity file. Some credit unions group those losses with their Other Consumer portfolio under the Call Report category ?All Other Unsecured Loans/Lines of Credit? (994/CH0007/CH0008)."
"For loss severity, we do not use a ?Closed book flag?, should we leave blank?"	"This field is important for us to treat loans that have are still in the loss process and those that have completed it appropriately in our internal analysis. Even if your credit union does not use an explicit ?closed book flag?, your credit union may already have internal business logic that can be used to populate this field. For example, your risk analysis or modeling may use internal policies or logic to determine where loans are in their loss and recovery phase. An example of this could be business logic that is used to determine the population of loans that are used to measure a portfolio?s loss given default"
"For loss severity, what is required in the ?Default Date? i.e., charge off date, repossession date, loan default date i.e., late but not charge off?"	"The field definition mentions several different dates, but this field is intended to capture the date the loan was in default according to your credit union?s internal policies. In many cases this will be the date your credit union considers the loan to be in default since this often pre? dates charge?offs or repossessions."
"For loss severity, on ?cumulative recovery amount?, what is considered ?less expenses?"	"Our goal is to capture the net recovery amount (value recouped from disposition of collateral net of expenses) to understand the overall loss on the loan. Please include expenses attributable to specific loans that are incurred during the loss and recovery phase, such as carrying costs, inspection costs, appraisal fees, or legal fees"
"For the Membership field requirements, ACTIVE_MEMBER_FLAG?s description states ? ?Flag that indicates if the customer is an active member during any part of the reporting period. A ""N"" response indicates nonmember customers.?. This appears to be stating two scenarios, one for active members and the other for nonmembers. Please clarify how we should classify Y and N."	"For the Membership field requirements, ACTIVE_MEMBER_FLAG?s description states ? ?Flag that indicates if the customer is an active member during any part of the reporting period. A ""N"" response indicates nonmember customers.?. This appears to be stating two scenarios, one for active members and the other for nonmembers. Please clarify how we should classify Y and N."
"Member ID, is this any unique number that we would create that would remain the same for the member throughout future reporting?"	"Correct. Also note that the ID must be at most 150 characters long and should not include any PII (e.g., social security numbers, etc.)"
Can you grant access to uploading files at the secured FTP stie from a team email?	NCUA IT department only allows individual emails to gain access to the secured FTP site.
Are we able to upload ONESData templates individually as we complete them or should we wait until all of the templates are completed and submit all at one time?	"Submitting the data templates as you complete them should be fine. However, we generally process and report back feedback on the data quality for the submissions after the submission deadline has passed."
Can we automate the file loading process?	Currently NCUA SFTP application only allows manual upload.
What does ?CARB certification? mean?	"A vehicle that has been approved by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for use in the state of California has received CARB certification. An automaker must go through a California certification process, and receive approval from CARB in the form of a CARB Executive Order, before the automaker is legally permitted to offer that make and model in California. A CARB certified vehicle may also be certified for use in all 50 states (including California). A vehicle that is certified as a ?federal? vehicle is not CARB certified."
How can I tell if the new vehicles I order from my supplier have CARB certification?	"Inventory ordering differs depending on the source. Your supplier should be able to tell you how to order Pennsylvania compliant vehicles properly when you place orders for MY 2008 or later inventory. When the delivery is received, two mechanisms provide the ultimate assurance a vehicle is CARB certified."
My Pennsylvania dealership is close to the Pennsylvania border and I frequently get non-Pennsylvania resident customers. Must I sell them CARB certified vehicles?	No. A Pennsylvania dealer may offer non-CARB certified vehicles to residents of other states only
Am I permitted to sell CARB certified vehicles to customers that may reside in a state that does not require the sale of CARB certified vehicles to its residents?	Yes
My dealership is located in a state adjacent to Pennsylvania that does not require CARB certified vehicles. May I acquire CARB certified vehicles from my supplier and sell them to Pennsylvania residents and/or residents of my state?	Yes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policy on cross-border sales allows states adjacent to states requiring CARB certified vehicles both to acquire and offer for sale CARB certified vehicles. Availability of CARB certified vehicles for acquisition in these situations is determined by the supplier. EPA?s policy also does not prohibit the dealer from selling CARB certified vehicles to residents of the state in which the dealership is situated
As part of my non-Pennsylvania based dealership I possess a PennDOT Agent Number in order to issue Pennsylvania titles for my Pennsylvania customers. Does the CARB certification requirement apply to my titling activities for Pennsylvania customers?	Yes. See Pennsylvania Title Issuing Agent FAQ for information on titling procedures under the PCV program.
What vehicles are exempt from the Program?	Section 126.413 of the Clean Vehicles Program rules list all eligible exemptions for qualifying or subject vehicles. 
 How is a qualifying or subject vehicle exempted?	Approved title issuing agents have procedures for titling exempted vehicles. See Pennsylvania Title Issuing Agent FAQ for information on titling procedures under the PCV program
"In addition to new automobile sales, my dealership provides long-term leases and daily vehicle rentals or leases. Do these vehicles require CARB certification?"	"Yes. Persons may daily rent or lease model year 2008 or newer non-CARB certified vehicles to the general public, but only if the vehicle is registered and principally operated outside of this Commonwealth. If your business subscribes to the International Registration Plan for apportionment of registration fees, the daily rented or leased vehicle is considered to be principally operated outside of this Commonwealth."
 If I know that my dealership will be dealing in cars that will ultimately receive exemptions (such as emergency vehicles) can I possess non-CARB certified vehicles in my inventory?	"A.ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ Yes, provided that inventory is not offered for sale for any purpose other than that provided by the anticipated exemption. These vehicles should either be physically segregated from the inventory available to the general purchasing public or clearly marked as either not available for Pennsylvania residents or are intended for use only for a specific exempt purpose."
" I don?t sell new cars directly but buy late-model, low-mileage vehicles via a third-party such as an auction. Does this mean I can only buy those model year 2008 and newer vehicles only with CARB certification?"	"Any vehicle you acquire that is model year 2008 or newer and has less than 7500 miles on the odometer must be CARB certified or else it cannot be offered for sale, sold, leased, rented or delivered to a Pennsylvania motorist. If the model year 2008 or newer vehicle has 7500 miles or more on the odometer, it is not considered new and therefore does not require CARB certification. Any vehicle older than model year 2008 can be offered for sale, sold, leased, rented or delivered regardless of certification"
 Is my dealership allowed to transfer non-CARB certified vehicles to another dealer?	"Yes, but only if the non-CARB certified vehicle is intended for ultimate sale outside of Pennsylvania. A Pennsylvania dealer may transfer vehicles not subject to the PCV program (such as medium or heavy duty trucks, vehicles older model year 2008, or vehicles with 7,500 miles or more on the odometer) to other Pennsylvania dealers without qualification. "
Will I be able to offer for sale diesel vehicles under the PCV program? 	"Yes. The PCV program does not prohibit diesel engines in cars, light-duty trucks and SUV?s. Diesel vehicles weighing 8500 pounds or less must have CARB certification. The most popular diesel trucks generally weigh more than 8500 pounds and, therefore, do not require CARB certification. Automakers have indicated that more light-duty diesel vehicles that meet both California and federal standards will be available in model years 2008 and 2009. "
Are all new Hybrid-Electric Vehicles California emissions compliant? 	No. There are hybrid-electric vehicles that may not be CARB-certified. Hybrid-electric vehicles offered for sale in Pennsylvania must be CARB certified for use in California or all 50 states. Check with your supplier to ensure the hybrid-electric vehicles you order are compliant for sale in Pennsylvania.
Do CARB certified vehicles cost more?	"In the past, the prices of CARB-certified vehicles have been the same as those that are only ""federally"" certified."
Are CARB certified vehicles exempt from Pennsylvania Emissions Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) requirements?	"No. CARB certified vehicle are subject to the same inspection requirements as non-CARB certified vehicles when those vehicles are registered in one of the 25 Pennsylvania counties that require annual emissions inspection. A brand-new, current model year vehicle is eligible for an I/M exemption for the first year. "

AIRBAG HANDLING AND STORAGE	"? Store the removed airbag with the pad surface up. ? Keep free from any oil, grease, detergent, or water to prevent damage to the airbag assembly. ? Store the removed airbag on secure, flat surface away from any high heat source (exceeding 85øC/185øF). ? Never perform electrical inspections to the airbags, such as measuring resistance. ? Do not position yourself in front of the airbag assembly during removal, inspection, or replacement. ? Refer to the scrapping procedures for disposal of the damaged airbag. ? Be careful not to bump or impact the SRS unit or the side impact sensors whenever the ignition switch is ON, wait at least three minutes after the ignition switch is turned OFF before begin work. ? During installation or replacement, be careful not to bump (by impact wrench, hammer, etc.) the area around the SRS unit and the side impact sensor. The airbags could accidentally deploy and cause damage or injury."
WIRING PRECAUTIONS	"? Never attempt to modify, splice, or repair SRS wiring. If there is an open or damage in SRS wiring, replace the harness. ? Be sure to install the harness wires so that they are not pinched, or interfere with other parts. ? Make sure all SRS ground locations are clean, and grounds are securely fastened for optimum metal-to-metal contact. Poor grounding can cause intermittent problems that are difficult to diagnose."
PRECAUTIONS FOR ELECTRICAL INSPECTIONS	"? When using electrical test equipment, insert the probe of the tester into the wire side of the connector. Do not insert the probe of the tester into the terminal side of the connector, and do not tamper with the connector. ? Use a u-shaped probe. Do not insert the probe forcibly. ? Use specificed service connectors for troubleshooting. Using improper tools could cause an error in inspection due to poor metal contact."

SRSCM (SRS CONTROL MODULE)	"1. DC/DC converter: DC/DC converter in power supply unit includes up/down transformer converter, and provide ignition voltage for 2 front airbag ignition circuits and the internal operation voltage of the SRSCM. If the internal operation voltage is below critical value setting, it will perform resetting. 2. Safety sensor: Safety sensor is located in airbag ignition circuit. Safety sensor will operate airbag circuit at any deployment condition and release airbag circuit safely at normal driving condition. Safety sensor is a double contact electro-mechanical switch that will close detecting deceleration above certain criteria. 3. Back up power supply: SRSCM has separate back up power supply, that will supply deployment energy instantly in low voltage condition or upon power failure by front crash. 4. Self diagnosis: SRSCM will constantly monitor current SRS operation status and detect system failure while vehicle power supply is on, system failure may be checked with trouble codes using scan tool. (Hi-Scan) 5. Airbag warning lamp on: Upon detecting error, the module will transmit signal to SRSCM indicator lamp located at cluster. MIL lamp will indicate driver SRS error. Upon ignition key on, SRS lamp will turn on for about six seconds. 6. Trouble code registration: Upon error occurrence in system, SRSCM will store DTC corresponding to the error. DTC can be cleared only by Hi-Scan. However, if an internal fault code is logged or if a crash is recorded the fault clearing should not happen. 7. Self diagnostic connector: Data stored in SRSCM memory will be output to Hi-Scan or other external output devices through Page 3 of 248 https://www.hyundaitechinfo.com/viewer/toc_print.asp?vehicletype=Passenger&mfrc... 12/03/2013 connector located below driver side crash pad. 8. Once airbag is deployed, SRSCM should not be used again but replaced. 9. SRSCM will determine whether passenger put on seat belt by the signal from built-in switch in seat belt buckle, and deploy front seat airbag at each set crash speed. 10. Side airbag deployment will be determined by SRSCM that will detect satellite sensor impact signal upon side crash, irrespective to seat belt condition."
WARNING LAMP BEHAVIOR AFTER IGNITION ON	"As soon as the operating voltage is applied to the SRSCM ignition input, the SRSCM activates the warning lamp for a bulb check. The lamp shall turn on for 6 seconds during the initialization phase and be turned off afterward. However, in order to warn the driver, the warning lamp shall turn on for 6 seconds and off for one second then on continuously after the operating voltage is applied if any active fault exists"
SRSCM INDEPENDENT WARNING LAMP ACTIVATION	"There are certain fault conditions in which the SRSCM cannot function and thus cannot control the operation of the standard warning lamp. In these cases, the standard warning lamp is directly activated by appropriate circuitry that operates independently of the SRSCM. These cases are:1. Loss of battery supply to the SRSCM : warning lamp turned on continuously.2. Loss of internal operating voltage : warning lamp turned on continuously.3. Loss of Microprocessor operation : warning lamp turned on continuously.4. SRSCM not connected : warning lamp turned on continuously through the shorting bar."
TELLTALE LAMP ACTIVATION	"The Telltale Lamp indicates the Passenger Airbag(PAB) enabled and disabled status based on occupant status of passenger seat. If the passenger seat is empty or occupied with child (or child seat), the Passenger Airbag is disabled and the Telltale Lamp is turned ON to inform the driver that the PAB is disabled. As soon as operating voltage is applied to the SRSCM ignition input, the SRSCM activates telltale lamp prove out."
SPECIAL TOOL REQUIRED	"Before scrapping any airbags or side airbags (including those in a whole vehicle to be scrapped), the airbags or side airbags must be deployed. If the vehicle is still within the warranty period, before deploying the airbags or side airbags, the Technical Manager must give approval and/or special instruction. Only after the airbags or side airbags have been deployed (as the result of vehicle collision, for example), can they be scrapped. If the airbags or side airbags appear intact (not deployed), treat them with extreme caution. Follow this procedure."
DEPLOYING AIRBAGS IN THE VEHICLE	"If an SRS equipped vehicle is to be entirely scrapped, its airbags or side airbags should be deployed while still in the vehicle. The airbags or side airbags should not be considered as salvageable parts and should never be installed in another vehicle.1. Turn the ignition switch OFF, and disconnect the battery negative cable and wait at least three minutes.2. Confirm that each airbag or side airbag is securely mounted.3. Confirm that the special tool is functioning properly by following the check procedure."

How to find the correct tire pressure for my car ?	"The fastest and easiest way to find your car?s tire pressure is to check the label you can find near the door lock when you open the driver?s door.Follow these steps to find the correct tire pressure for your car:1. Check the label behind the driver?s doorCar Tire Pressure LabelOn almost all car models, you will find a label when you open the driver?s door. The tire pressure for the original tire sizes and how much you should inflate the tire depending on your vehicle?s load weight is often listed here.Some cars do not have this label, and in this case, you have to try an alternative.2. Check Service ManualCar ManualAlmost always, when you buy a car, you will get a service manual describing your car?s basic functions. This manual is often located in the glove box together with the other documents. In this manual, you can often find what fluids you should fill your car with and your car?s recommended tire pressure.If you can?t find this service manual, it is time to go to the next step.3. VIN decoderVin DecoderThere are a lot of free VIN decoders out there on the internet. The downside of this is that you need to find the VIN of your car first. You can often find the VIN of your car below the front windshield, in the trunk, or under the hood.On some US car part sites, you can also enter your license plate number to get your VIN and use it to find the correct tire pressure for your car.4. Call Your Authorized DealerCall Car DealerIf you are not sure of finding the correct tire pressure by using the methods above, you can always call your authorized dealer for your car model?s brand.They can often get the correct tire pressure within the blink of an eye, and you will not have to spend any more effort to find it."
What does cold tire inflation pressure mean?	"On the tire pressure labels, you will often find something named ?cold tire inflation pressure.? What does this actually mean, and will it really make a difference?You need to know that the tire pressure differs greatly in your tires depending on the tire?s air temperature. When you are driving for long distances, especially in warm weather, the friction will create a lot of heat in your tires, which will also add a lot of pressure.So, what happens if you inflate the tires to 36 psi / 2.5 bar directly after this? It will probably sink to 32 psi / 2.2 bar when the tires cool down, and this will cause you to drive around with too low pressure when they are cold.This is why it is listed as cold tire inflation pressure, and also why you should always inflate the tires when they are cold."
what are the measure of the tread depth of the tires ?	"Tread depth [limit] must be  1.6 mm (0.063 in).  If the remaining tread depth is less than the limit, replace the tire                                                                                                                                                                                 "
How to know that the tread depth of the tires is less than the limit ?	The wear indicators  will appear on the tire.
Why the car is continuously pulling to one side while driving at higher speeds?	"It?s the chief sign that you need a wheel alignment, and if you ignore it, you?re just inviting more problems."
Why the car steering wheel is not aligned when driving on straight roads?	It is a sign that the wheel alignment is bad.
How to know that my car have bad wheel  alignment ?	"If you?re driving straight down the road and take your hands off the wheel, your vehicle should continue to head straight. While this might vary from time to time due to the road?s condition, it shouldn?t always pull in the same direction."
Why my car  steering wheel is not properly aligned?	"If your steering wheel is completely centered, your front wheels should be too. If you center the steering wheel while you?re turning the vehicle, that?s an alignment issue else this  problem could be an issue with your wheel alignment, steering wheel alignment, or steering column alignment."
Why i hear squealing noises while driving?	"That noise comes from your tires dragging across the pavement instead of rolling as they should. You?ll likely only hear these squealing sounds if the alignment is particularly bad, and if this is the case, you need to get it fixed immediately."
Why i feel a vibrating steering wheel while driving my car ?	" Those vibrations are caused by the tire skipping across the pavement as you drive and  the wheel alignment which is bad enough, you could feel the vibrations in the steering wheel while driving. That skipping is putting pressure on all of the steering components between the steering wheel and the tires, and the end result is the vibrations you?re feeling"
what are the types  of the wheel alignments ?	"There are three different alignments that you can make to your tire ? and while some drivers will intentionally create these conditions, they?ll always lead to premature wear and reduced performance. The three types of wheel alignments are: 1. Camber Angle , 2. Toe In & Toe Out Angle , 3. Caster Angle."
Can yo tell me more about this three types of whell alignments?	"First Type : Camber refers to the way the top of the tire tilts in relation to the bottom of the tire. If the top of the tire is sticking out farther towards the car?s edge, you have positive camber. If the bottom sticks out farther, you have negative camber,Both positive and negative camber reduces the amount of traction each tire gets and leads to premature tire wear. Second Tpye: Toe In & Toe Out Angle Toe refers to the way the front of the tire tilts to the rear of the tire. If the front of the tire points in, you have ?toe-in.? If the front of the tire points out and away from the car, you have ?tow-out.? Incorrectly aligned tow will lead to premature tire wear, and your tires will ?skip? as you drive. Third Type:Caster Angle the last major wheel alignment is caster. Caster refers to the way your vehicle?s suspension mounts to the hub. If the upper point leans towards the rear of the car, you have negative caster, and if it leans towards the front, you have a positive caster.Unlike the other alignments, which you always want straight up, you actually want a slight positive caster to help control your vehicle."
Is bad wheel alignment is a dangerous problem ?	"Wheel alignments are a critical part of your vehicle. While you might think that?s alright if the alignment is a little bit off, what you might not realize is that the longer you let it go, the worse it will get and the more damage you?ll cause.                                                   Tires wearing down prematurely is just the start. You?ll also wear down your suspension and steering components, and if the alignment is bad enough, you?ll end up breaking things.Just as bad is the reduced performance that bad wheel alignments cause. You?ll get worse traction, which will keep you from accelerating as quickly, and more importantly, will increase the necessary braking distance.For all these performance and premature wear concerns, you need to get your alignment fixed as soon as you notice a problem. While you might think this is an expensive process ? this couldn?t be further from the truth.Either way, it?s a small price to pay to get a few thousand more miles out of your tires and save your suspension and steering components for a few extra years. It?s a small price to pay now that more than pays for itself down the road."
How Long Does a Wheel Alignment Take?	"The average wheel alignment takes 30 to 60 minutes once the vehicle is taken into the tire shop. However, the type of alignment, type of vehicle, condition of the components and the experience of the technicians can all impact how long your vehicle is needed in the shop. "
what are Wheel Alignment?	"The tire alignment involves ensuring that all of the wheels are in line with each other and the road surface. With advanced calibration, the wheels are aligned to ensure the tires sit at their proper position. You can?t perform a proper wheel alignment without a special alignment machine, making it difficult to do at home.During a wheel alignment, the suspension angles are adjusted and the positioning is changed until everything falls in line. The type of alignment needed differs by what type of vehicle you drive. However, the principles behind the car alignment service remain the same, no matter how many tires are being dealt with."
what are the factors affecting wheel alignment time?	"There are four different factors : 1. Type of Alignment,2. Type of Vehicle,3. Component Condition,4. Experience of Technician"
Can yo tell me more about this four cases that affect wheel alignment time ?	"First Case :                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Type of Alignment There are different types of wheel alignments, some take longer than others. For example, if you have a four-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive vehicle, you usually need a four-wheel alignment.Clearly, the more tires that are aligned, the longer you will be visiting the shop. If you have a front- or rear-wheel drive vehicle, you may only need a front-end alignment. This isn?t just the cheaper option, but it?s also the fastest. There?s also the option to get a Toe-n-Go alignment. Shops will provide a quick toe angle adjustment on the front wheels. This is the most frequent issue, easily corrected in just about fifteen minutes. However, the high-quality shop won?t offer this type of alignment because it?s not seen as the proper way to handle the tires, according to top professionals.This is mainly because a wheel misalignment of the camber angle and the caster angle ? which are not adjusted for this type of service, can also cause wear and tear.                                                                                                                                                                       Second Case:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Type of Vehicle You wouldn?t think that the vehicle type would affect how long you are at the shop, but not every car is easy to align. If you drive a compact sedan with 15? wheels, you are going to be at the shop for less time than the heavy-duty pickup with 33? wheels will be a longer wheel alignment process. Additionally, the shop needs to easily access the various suspension system components under the vehicle to align it. With some vehicles, it?s easier to get to the tie rods and other components when compared with others. If you want to know how difficult it is to work on your vehicle, ask the tire shop when you make an appointment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Third Case:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Component Condition consider the model year of your vehicle to determine how long the alignment might take. If you are driving a 2020 vehicle, the alignment might take less time than working with the 2002 vehicle. The longer the suspension parts have been on the vehicle, the more likely the bolts or nuts might be rusted or seized. These complications cause the alignment to take longer. Additionally, if the technician discovers that some of the suspension components are damaged, you might need to have them repaired or replaced before the alignment can take place. There?s no sense doing a wheel alignment on a car with a bad suspension system. Fourth Case:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Experience of Technician If you visit a shop hiring entry-level technicians, it could take you longer to get the alignment done. These technicians are just learning how to use the sophisticated machinery, so there will be a learning curve. Of course, these shops offer some of the lowest rates, so you must determine if the savings is worth the extra time. On the other hand, if you visit a shop with ASE-certified mechanics with decades of experience, you will get the fastest wheel alignment possible. They know exactly how to get the wheels and brakes locked and aligned quickly and accurately for a good end result. Still, you need to be prepared to pay a premium price for this level of experience. It?s worth paying more if your time is money, keeping you from working by being at the shop.

How often is a car need a wheel alignment ?	"Depending on the type of vehicle you drive and the manufacturer?s recommendations, you might need a wheel alignment every 6,000 miles. However, you should be sure to get one at least annually, especially if you know you?ve been driving over a pothole or a large bump a little too fast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Additionally, you want to have the wheel alignment checked if you notice any of these symptoms:1:Car pulls to one side2:Vibration of steering wheel3:Steering wheel is off-center4:Wheel vibration5:Uneven tire wear"
How Much Does a Tire Alignment Cost?	"Many shops charge a flat rate for wheel alignment, depending on what type of vehicle you own. If you were going to have all four wheels aligned, you might spend around $200. However, the cost depends on where you live in the country and what type of repair shop you are visiting. If the tire shop offers a package deal, you might be able to get a better rate. You can find a lot of these packages in shops that sell new tires. You can pay ahead of time for services, such as road hazard, alignment, rotation and balancing. Considering how many times you will visit over the life of the tires, it often pays to pre-purchase these services. Look at the plan as a type of insurance policy for your car?s tire health."
Why Do Some Cars Have Tilted Wheels?	"The main reason why some cars have tilted or slanted wheels is because of aesthetic reasons. Most people do it just because it looks good. A little lean can improve your car?s cornering performance, but if you have very inclined wheels, it will worsen it."
Why i hear squealing noises while driving?	"Car wheel alignment is an important aspect of vehicle maintenance that involves adjusting the angles of the wheels so that they are perpendicular to the ground and parallel to each other. Proper wheel alignment ensures that the vehicle handles and performs as it should, maximizes tire life, and reduces wear and tear on suspension components. Here are some key points to keep in mind about car wheel alignment:Signs of misalignment: There are several signs that your car may be out of alignment, including uneven or rapid tire wear, the vehicle pulling to one side, the steering wheel being off-center when driving straight, and a vibration in the steering wheel or vehicle.Types of alignment angles: There are three main types of wheel alignment angles: camber, caster, and toe. Camber refers to the inward or outward tilt of the wheels when viewed from the front or rear. Caster refers to the angle of the steering axis when viewed from the side of the vehicle. Toe refers to the angle of the wheels when viewed from above or below, and can be either ""toe-in"" or ""toe-out.""Alignment procedures: Wheel alignment should be performed by a qualified technician using specialized equipment. During the alignment procedure, the technician will check the current alignment angles and adjust them as necessary to bring them back within the manufacturer's specifications. They may also inspect suspension and steering components for damage or wear.Frequency of alignment: The frequency of wheel alignment depends on several factors, including driving habits, road conditions, and vehicle type. In general, it is recommended to have wheel alignment checked at least once per year or every 10,000 to 12,000 miles. However, if you notice any signs of misalignment, it is important"
How to know that my car have bad wheel  alignment ?	"There are several signs that your car may have bad wheel alignment. Here are some of the most common signs to look out for:Uneven or rapid tire wear: If your tires are wearing unevenly or more quickly than normal, it could be a sign of bad wheel alignment. Look for signs of wear on the inside or outside edges of the tires, as well as bald spots or other unusual wear patterns.Vehicle pulling to one side: If your car pulls to one side while you're driving, it could be a sign of bad wheel alignment. This can make it difficult to keep the car in a straight line, especially at higher speeds.Off-center steering wheel: If the steering wheel is off-center when you're driving straight, it could be a sign of bad wheel alignment. This can also make it difficult to keep the car in a straight line.Vibration in the steering wheel or vehicle: If you feel a vibration in the steering wheel or throughout the car while you're driving, it could be a sign of bad wheel alignment. This can be caused by the wheels pulling in different directions or by other issues with the steering and suspension systems.If you notice any of these signs, it's important to have your wheel alignment checked by a qualified technician. Bad wheel alignment can cause a variety of problems, including reduced handling and performance, increased tire wear, and reduced fuel efficiency, so it's important to address it as soon as possible."
what are the wheels camber angle ?	"When referring to wheels, Camber is the angle at which a tire is inclined relative to the road. You can observe this angle when a car is cornering. The tire settings are adjusted to ensure that as much tire surface area is in contact with the ground.Most of the time you observe a stationary car?s wheels, you will assume that it is perpendicular to the wheel. But, this is not often the case because the wheel is indented a little.When the wheel is immobile, the static camber is maintained, but when it is cornering, camber settings are adjusted so that more of the wheel is in contact with the road.Cars can have both positive and negative cambers. Negative camber occurs when the top part of the wheel is leaning closer to the center, while positive camber occurs when the top of the wheel is pointed outwards. What you see in many tilted inclined wheels is the negative camber.Whenever you see the outside wheels leaning outside of the car?s body, you realize that the part of the wheel that is in contact with the road diminishes. In many cars, negative camber is good because it corrects the effects of leaning during cornering.However, too much negative camber causes the car to have more sensitivity to the road?s crown. The tires also wear out at a faster rate than other cars."
How Far Should You Go With Inclined Wheels?	"The amount of wheel inclination that you want for your car will depend on the type of suspension you have. Once you have changed the suspension, you will be required to change the camber plates. With more inclination, more pressure is applied to the wheel that is in contact with the ground.Most of the stanced cars also have their body slammed ? that is the lowering of the car?s body. This creates what motor car enthusiasts call ?hellaflush? which means you have little body contact with the wheels.Another way to modify your car wheels is to have a stretched tire. Here, you purchase the maximum permitted wheel by the manufacturer and have it fitted to your car ? with some modifications to the suspension.Many people choose to have tilted inclined wheels not because it increases the car?s performance but because it has a cosmetic value."
What Are the Dangers of Very Inclined Wheels?	"As you might understand by now, most people have camber on their car because it looks cool. What you must know is that having too much camber can actually be dangerous also. Here are some reasons why you should not driving with too much camber. As 1. Braking, 2. Tire Wear, 3. Drivetrain Wear, 4. Cornering, 5. Steering"
Can yo tell me more about the Dangers of Very Inclined Wheels?	"1. BrakingThe first problem you will experience with stanced cars is that you will have problems with braking. A normal car is designed with most of the wheel having contact with the road. This gives it grip and enables emergency braking. In cases where almost half of the tire is suspended in the air, the tire grip is reduced. This makes it hard to stop during emergency braking. This is the main reason why many traffic safety authorities are against the practice.                                                                                                                                                 2. Tire WearThe chances of punctures are greatly increased because one side of the tire undergoes a lot of tears. If you plan on inclining your wheels then be prepared to spend extra for tires and maintenance.                                                                                                                          3. Drivetrain WearIf you think that only the tires that are affected when you have tilted inclined wheels, you have more maintenance costs coming. All the driveshaft components ? wheel bearings, CV joints, bushes ? are all designed to be used when the wheels are at a certain angle. Excessive negative camber puts pressure on these joints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           4. CorneringCars are designed to have a level of negative camber. This is vital when you are cornering. But, when you incline your wheels too much, you are putting too much pressure on the wheel parts that are in contact with the ground. At extreme speeds, this can cause your driveshaft to fail further, causing accidents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  5. SteeringVery inclined wheels also have problems when steering. The steering cannot reach full lock because the geometry used to design them did not factor in extreme negative camber.The suspension is also affected because it needs down travel and up travel, and all this has to be properly aligned with the wheels. Problems arise because those making modifications do not have an angle grinder for perfect suspension angles.                                      Driving the car on its sidewall is dangerous because this part of the tire is not supposed to have contact with the ground. Having too much weight on this weak area increases the chances of punctures."

They are a popular choice for drivers who prioritize comfort and ride quality.Run-flat tires: These tires are designed to allow you to continue driving at a reduced speed for a short distance even after a puncture or other damage to the tire. This can be a useful feature if you want to avoid changing a flat tire on the side of the road.Off-road tires: These tires are designed for use on unpaved roads and rough terrain. They typically have larger tread blocks and deeper grooves than other tire types, providing better traction on uneven surfaces.Overall, the type of tire you choose will depend on your specific driving needs and the weather conditions you typically encounter. It's important to choose a tire that will provide the performance, safety, and comfort you need to enjoy your driving experience."
Is It Safe To Buy Used Tires?	"It can be safe to buy used tires, but it depends. Some used tires have better tread and rubber quality than others. If the tread depth is at least 4/32? and there is no damage or cracks, the tires are probably perfectly safe. Otherwise, you don?t want to take a chance on buying used tires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Once the tires get to 3/32? of tread depth or less, you need to replace them. Driving at this depth is dangerous, especially at highway speeds or across slippery surfaces. "
what are the Advantages Of Buying Used Tires ?	"The main reason that people purchase used tires is to save money. How much can be saved depends on how much life is left in the tires and the condition of the rubber. Additionally, used tires are environmentally friendly, helping to keep the old rubber out of landfills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1.

If these tires aren?t sold or used for other purposes, they will contribute to additional pollution of the environment. While there is a great demand for recycled rubber, it does cost money for the process. While the rubber can be made into asphalt for the roads or running tracks, it?s much easier to put them on another car. Used tire dealers can take them off one car and use them again, thereby reducing pollution and avoiding any more production.                                       2. Lower Cost                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You will spend less to put used tires on your car than a new set. For example, you may purchase a used tire for $50, whereas a new one would cost around $200.  While this is less money upfront, it may not produce the best value. Taking the same example from above, think about its lifespan. A brand-new tire should last three to four years. If you pay half price, you would expect that tire to last 1.5 to two years, but that?s probably not the case.You will probably pay more, in the long run, to keep putting used tires on the car because of the frequency. However, if you are in a pinch for money now, used tires are going to be a better option. "
what are the Disadvantages Of Buying Used Tires?	"The biggest downside to choosing used tires is the risk factor. There are also so many other unknown aspects that you may not exactly know what you are getting. Let?s see what this means for the average consumer.                                                                                       1. Higher Risk Factor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Your first consideration must always be safety, but used tires aren?t always safe. Older, worn-out tires are going to have less tread depth than a new tire. If the tread depth gets to be 3/32? or less, the tires could contribute to an accident. Additionally, you need to look at the well-being of the tread and rubber quality. If there are chunks out of it or any damage, it doesn?t matter how much tread is left, the tires could be dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                         2. Unknown Aspects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A quick inspection can tell you a lot about the tire, but it may not reveal everything. First of all, you may not be immediately able to tell how old the tires are. If the tires are older than six years, there could be bead damage or dry rot you can?t see. There are also no guidelines about buying used tires. The Federal Government has strict standards in place for new tires, but that?s not true if they?ve already been used. You don?t know how the tires have been used, if they were driven under-inflated or if the owners otherwise abused them. All of these unknowns can lead to a riskier venture.                                                                            "
Can you tell me the difference between the Used Tires and New Tires ? 	"When you buy new tires, you get a warranty. Usually, the tires are warrantied for construction, ensuring there are no manufacturer?s defects and the tread life. You know what to expect when it comes to how the tires handle and the steering comfort. The opposite is true with used tires. You aren?t going to get a warranty and it?s unclear how they will handle. Of course, if you are tight on cash, used tires may be a better option. Additionally, if you have a leased vehicle that you are preparing to turn back in soon, you may not want to spend $600 on a set of tires. Instead, look for a decent pair of used tires and save some money. "
what are the Things To Check Before You Buy Used Tires ?	"If you decide that you want used tires, here are a few things to consider first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1. Age                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The tire?s age can be found on the sidewall. It is the final numbers following the DOT. The first two numbers indicate what week of the year it was produced. The final two numbers indicate the year. For example, if you have a 3720, it means that the tire was made during the 37th week of 2020. Considering tires only have a life of about six years, you shouldn?t purchase anything that?s too old.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2. UTQG CodeThe Uniform Tire Quality Grade Standards (UTQG) rating tells you how quickly the tire wears out. If this number is smaller, it?s going to wear out faster. Therefore, if you find used tires with a UTQG rating of 100, these tires won?t last long. On the other hand, tires with a UTQG rating of 450 to 600 are designed to last much longer.                                                                                                                                                         3. Tread Depth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      By performing a penny test on the tires, you can ensure that there?s plenty of tread left. Here?s how to perform a penny test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Put a penny into the tread grooves with Lincoln?s head down. If you see his head completely, the tires are too low.If you can?t see his head, there?s still life left in the tire. Aside from using a penny, you can also check tread depth with a quarter. However, the best measurement is taken with a tread depth gauge tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  4. Tire WearInspect the tread for uneven wear. If the tire wear pattern seems odd, it could be that the tires were over or under-inflated, leading to additional damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                   You also want to examine the sidewalls and the beads. There should be no cracks, cuts or bulges in any part of the tire. "
Where To Buy Used Tires?	"The most obvious place to purchase used tires is through a local tire dealer. If you already have a relationship with a dealer, you are sure to get your best deals this way. Plus, most repair shops will allow you to check the condition of the tire before buying them, giving you some piece of mind.You may also find your used tires online through eBay, Craigslist, or Facebook Marketplace. However, the condition of the tires may not be immediately known and you are relying on the seller, to be honest.  Most big box stores aren?t going to sell used tires. These locations ship out the tires to be recycled instead. The same is true for Amazon. You can purchase new tires at this online giant, but not used tires. "
Is it better to buy used tires or new tires?	"It?s safer to buy new tires in most cases. Unless you can physically inspect the used tires and see that they are in good shape, you are at risk for an accident. However, used tires are much cheaper, which can be a good option if you need to save some cash. "
How do you know if a used tire is good?	"Perform a penny test to see if there?s still plenty of tread left on the tire. You also want to read the date code on the side to ensure that the tire is less than six years old. Furthermore, you must inspect the tire for damage, uneven wear or other signs of abuse. "
How long are used tires good for?	"Most tires start to deteriorate after six years, even if they haven?t been used heavily. For this reason, you want to check the date code on used tires to ensure they are newer than this. An inspection of the tire is also necessary to ensure it isn?t wearing out prematurely. "
How much tread is good on a used tire?	"You can continue driving with 4/32? of tread left on a tire. Anything lower than this should be replaced. Ideally, you would get a set of used tires with lots of tread left. The higher the tread measures, the more life you can expect to get from the tires.ÿ"
Is it better to buy cheap or used tires?	"There are risks with either option. Cheap tires aren?t going to last as long as a good set, but they will still come with a warranty against defects. You can buy a better set of used tires, but there?s no warranty and you won?t be entirely sure of its previous life. You must weigh the pros and the cons of both. "
Why I feel an Excessive vibrations while driving my car?	"It?s by far the most common symptom of unbalanced tires, and it?s also what you?re likely to notice first. If you?re driving down the road and feel an excessive amount of vibrations, it can be a host of problems. If the problem cropped up right after you got new tires, the tires being unbalanced is probably the cause."
why i feel Rough Steering  while i driving my car ?	"When you?re driving down the road, all four tires should exert the same amount of force on the ground at each rotation. If your vehicle has an unbalanced tire, you?re going to feel it while you?re trying to drive. While you?ll get excessive vibrations while you?re driving straight, you?re going to magnify those problems every time you try to turn.Not only will the vibrations get worse, but you?re going to fight your vehicle through the turns a little more too."
why my car has Uneven/Unusual Tire Wear ?	"one problem you?re not going to want to deal with is the uneven or unusual tire wear. If the tires aren?t riding along the ground the right way, they?re going to wear abnormally.What this means for you is that the tires will wear down quicker, and you?re going to need to replace them sooner than you would otherwise. Uneven tires aren?t just frustrating; they can be expensive too."
what are the Symptoms Of Unbalanced Tires?	"Symptoms of unbalanced tires include:Vibrations: The most common symptom of unbalanced tires is vibrations felt in the steering wheel, seat, or floorboards. The vibrations are typically most noticeable at high speeds and can become increasingly uncomfortable the longer you drive.Uneven tire wear: Unbalanced tires can cause uneven tire wear, which can be seen as bald spots or uneven tread patterns on the tires. This can shorten the lifespan of your tires and require more frequent replacements.Steering problems: Unbalanced tires can also cause problems with your steering, making it difficult to control your vehicle. This can be particularly dangerous at high speeds or in emergency situations.Poor fuel economy: When your tires are unbalanced, it can cause your engine to work harder than necessary, leading to reduced fuel efficiency and higher fuel costs.Noises: Unbalanced tires can also cause unusual noises, such as squeaks or thumps, as you drive. These noises may be accompanied by a feeling of instability or a pulling sensation in the steering."
what are A Spare Tire?	"The donut spare tire is the smaller tire that?s included with some vehicles to use when a full-size goes flat. The donut tire is also known as the temporary spare tire. It?s smaller than a normal tire, so it?s not designed to be used as a regular tire.                                           You should only use a spare when one of your regular tires goes flat or needs to be replaced. Because the is smaller, it can fit easily in the car?s trunk. However, they aren?t meant to handle the same kind of travel as a regular tire. You only want to use it to get to the tire shop for a repair. The donut spare tire is used for emergencies only and should not be used with regular tire rotations. Once you are finished using it, the tire gets returned to its original location."
How Long Can I Drive on a Spare Tire?	"Normally, you don?t want to drive the spare tire more than 50 miles with a spare tire, but less would be better. Additionally, you shouldn?t run the tire faster than 50 mph. If you can go slower with your hazards on, that would be even better. Once you put a spare tire on in place of the regular tire, you need to know how long it?s safe to drive on. In general, it?s only meant to get you to the tire shop. "
How Long Can You Drive On a Spare Tire?

Full-Size Spare TireCar TireMany cars were built to hold a full-size spare in the tire well. If you have a larger vehicle, such as a truck or SUV, this is likely what you will find with your vehicle. Of course, not everyone is happy with the extra space and weight this requires, but the full-size spare drives just like your normal tire, as long as you take care of it. The benefit to this is that you can use the spare as a regular tire and purchase a new spare if that?s easier. All the tire shop will need to do is put your spare on the original rim and check the air pressure. It?s one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to deal with a flat tire. On the flip side, if you haven?t used the spare in a long time, it could be a different tire from the other three on your vehicle. In some cases, this difference can cause some drivability issues. If you can?t get a perfect match, it?s often best to purchase a new tire. 2. Space-Saver/Donut Spare TireDonut Spare TireTo save space, manufacturers started including a smaller spare, known as the donut. Not only does this tire need less room on the vehicle, but it?s also lightweight. These smaller tires were not built to last but merely get you to a repair shop. The owner?s manual is going to offer the best recommendation for driving speed and the time that you can spend on this tire. However, it?s normally recommended that you find a shop within 70 miles and you don?t exceed 50 mph on a donut. If you examine the tread of the compact tire, you will quickly see why you shouldn?t be relying on it. There is often little or no tread, making the tire more susceptible to blowouts and damage from road debris. The spare tire is also thinner than your normal tires. Therefore, you may notice some handling issues, especially if the tire is put on one of the front wheels that are responsible for steering.3. Run-Flat TireThe run-flat tire has grown in popularity because manufacturers are figuring out they have a lower maintenance cost than the traditional tire. You might have run-flat tires on your MINI or BMW vehicle in place of traditional tires. While these tires are meant to be tough, they aren?t going to last forever. Run-flat tires were specifically built to handle the majority of road hazards, standing up to punctures exceptionally well. This tire isn?t going to blow out or go flat like the traditional tire. Instead, it continues to drive for about 50 miles after the puncture occurs. On the downside, these tires do cost more to replace, so you are paying for the feature when you have to buy new tires. "
How Fast Can I Drive On A Spare Tire ?	"All spare tires are rated differently. You should be able to find the recommendations on the side. The speed rating for the spare will likely be 50 mph or less unless you are looking at a full-size tire.On top of that, you won?t want to drive it farther than necessary. Sometimes you are in a real bind where you are farther from home than you would like while on a spare tire. The good news is, there are tire shops within just a few minutes of most anywhere in the country. However, if you have to drive further than you would like, follow the same rules as if you were driving down the street. Keep your car in the slow lane on the highway and try to drive as straight as possible. You don?t want to jerk the wheel around or make any unnecessary lane changes. If you are traveling much slower than the other traffic, you will also need to turn on your hazard lights. By creating a plan before you need to use your spare, you know exactly what to do when this unfortunate event occurs."
what are A Tire Sidewall Damage?	"A tire sidewall damage is exactly what it sounds like; damage to the tire?s sidewall, meaning the damage is on the side of the tire and not the tire tread. Damage to the tire?s sidewall is not repairable in most cases.You can often spot tire sidewall damage by seeing a deep scratch or a bubble on the tire?s sidewall. This can come from a small accident or if you drove too close to the road?s curb.It can also happen because of sticks or other sharp things along the road. Tire sidewall damage is really bad to drive around with, and we explain why below."
Is it safe to drive on a tire with sidewall damage?	"No. Tire sidewall damage is not safe to drive with. The sidewalls of the tires are much more sensitive than the tread area. In many cases, the damage affects the whole structure of the tire, and it can cause it to blow at any moment.This also depends a little bit on how big the scratch or damage is. If the scratch is small and super-shallow and does not reach the threads, it is probably not something you should worry too much about."
How much tire sidewall damage is too much?	"A rule of thumb for determining how much tire sidewall damage is too much is that if you can see the threads in the damage, it is definitely time to replace the tire.The threads are often located 1/8? to 3/16? (3mm to 4.5mm) into the tire, but to more clearly determine if you need to replace the tire or not, you need to look at the damage itself.If there is an air-bubble on the tire?s sidewall, you need to replace it straight away because there is a big risk that it will blow at any moment.To be sure that nothing serious will happen to the tire, you should let an expert look at the damage.Find a repair shop that is not selling tires and ask them. If you go to a repair shop that sells tires, it is likely that they will try to sell you new tires, even if you do not need any."
Can I Repair a Tire Sidewall Damage?	"A damaged tire sidewall that reaches the threads should never be repaired because it damages the tire?s whole structure.If the tire?s sidewall has a bubble, that is not fixable either, and small punctures should also not be repaired.The only time you can glue together tire sidewall damage is if it is an extremely shallow scratch that is not reaching the threads.However, if the scratch or damage is this shallow, there is no point in gluing it either, so I would say that you should never repair tire sidewall damage."
what are the Causes of a Tire Sidewall Damage ?	There are a lot of things that could cause tire sidewall damage. Usually it will be because of sharp objects that you hit with the sidewall of the tire by accident. It can also be caused by age or driving around with too little air pressure in the tires.Here are some common causes of tire sidewall damage:Hitting a curbUnder-InflationPotholesSharp objectsAge Overload Manufacturing defects 
Can I replace just one tire?	"If you change the tires on the drive wheels, you should change both tires because the different tire diameters will stress the transmission.If you replace the tires on the rear of a front-wheel drive car, however, you can replace just one tire.If you have a 4WD car, it is always recommended to replace all four wheels because different tires diameters can cause stress to the differential or transmission. The best way to find out is to ask your authorized dealer if you can replace just one tire on your specific car model."
	"No. Tire sidewall damage is usually considered self-inflicted damage and not a manufacturer problem, and is therefore not covered under warranty in most cases.But if you want to be sure, you can always ask or read your warranty documents carefully. There are sometimes cases where you have a special car warranty."
How thick is the sidewall of a car tire?	"A car tire typically has a sidewall that is between 1/4? to 5/8? (5 to 15 mm) thick. However, this can vary depending on the specific tires that are being used. Some tires may have thicker or thinner sidewalls, depending on their design and intended purpose.For example, race car tires often have very thin sidewalls to help improve grip and handling. Likewise, some off-road tires may have thicker sidewalls to help protect against punctures from rocks or other debris."
How much tire sidewall damage is OK?	"Tire sidewall damage is never OK. A bulge or tear in a tire?s sidewall means that the internal tire structure has been compromised, and the tire should be replaced immediately. Driving on a tire with a damaged sidewall can cause it to blow out, resulting in a serious accident.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      If the air is leaking out of the core of the valve stem, you have a much easier fix. Spray a soapy solution on the valve stem to see where it is leaking. If the air bubbles come from within the core itself, you can get a valve core replacement tool and a new part without spending a lot of money.Jack up the appropriate wheel and remove the old core using the tool you purchased. Once it is out, you can easily screw in a new core. Just don?t screw it in too tightly or the threads could become stripped. Refill the tire with air and give it another go. The process is a little more difficult if you need to replace the tire valve stem. Many people prefer to take the vehicle to the tire shop for a professional replacement. However, you could do it yourself with the right tools and expertise. "
Can I Replace a Tire Valve Stem Without Removing the Tire?	"Yes, you can replace a tire valve stem without removing the tire from the rim. However, you must deflate the tire and separate the tire bead from the rim on the side where the tire valve stem is located. It can be a bit tricky but is definitely doable."
Where is the Tire Valve Stem Located?	"The tire valve stem is found in the wheel of the vehicle. It?s the valve where the tires get inflated. Inside the valve stem, there?s a valve core that?s spring-loaded utlizing the pressure from within the tire to seal itself. On the valve stem, there is a cap that keeps the debris and dirt from getting inside. This cap doesn?t help to keep the air in but is needed to keep the core and stem in good condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As the valve stem gets older, it can become brittle or crack. These problems lead to leaking, making it difficult to keep the proper amount of air inside the tire. Depending on how bad the situation is, the leak could be slow or fast. Either way, you will need to replace the core or the entire valve stem. "
How To Replace a Tire Valve Stem Without Removing The Tire?	"1. Gather MaterialsTo complete any automotive job, it?s important to have all of your tools handy. You don?t want to be searching around to find what you need. For most cases, these are the tools you should have on hand:Air compressor/hose (Optional)Lug nut wrenchJackJack standsTire ironSledgehammerNeedle nose pliers (Optional)Valve stem removal tool (Optional)2. Loosen Lug NutsTo work on the tire, you will first want to loosen up the lug nuts. It?s not time to take them off yet. You only need to loosen them up on the tire you plan to work on. With your lug nut wrench, turn them all slightly so the job is easier later on. 3. Jack Up CarMake sure the vehicle is parked on level ground. You also want to set the parking brake and possibly put wheel chocks down on the tires, which will remain on the ground.Carefully raise your vehicle up enough to get the tire off. You can set the vehicle on sturdy jack stands to complete the rest of the job. 4. Remove WheelYou loosened the lug nuts earlier, making it easy to get the wheel off now. Take the wheel off that needs work.Set it down on a flat surface. Make sure the outside part of the wheel remains facing up. Also, put the lug nuts in a safe location, so none of them get lost. 5. Deflate TireIt?s time to let all of the air out of the tire. To do this, start by taking the cap off of the valve stem. With your valve stem removal tool, take out the core. Once this is completed, the air will freely flow out from the tire. 6. Separate Tire BeadTo replace the valve stem, you must separate the bead from the tire. You can use a tire iron and sledgehammer to accomplish this task.While you pry the tire apart, hit the sidewall with the sledgehammer. Continue working in the same area until the bead breaks. It should make a popping or cracking sound once it is accomplished. Also, the inner lip of the tire will become visible. With the bead broken, you want to keep moving around the tire. Perform the same movements until the entire bead is broken around the tire. Only remove the bead on the side where the stem is located, if you remove both sides and rotate the tire by mistake you have to rebalance the wheel.                                                                                                                                                                                                          7. Remove Valve StemLift up the tire lip away from the wheel. You can use your tire iron to pry it upward and pull the lip over the wheel edge. You can do this to take the tire off of the rim, although some people successfully skip this step.With your needle nose pliers, you can remove the valve. Pull it away from the wheel to remove it. You can sometimes also use a knife and cut it to remove it easily, however, be careful so the cut part doesn?t stay inside the tire.8. Install New Valve StemFind your replacement valve stem. Install it into the wheel from the inside. You will need to use your needle nose pliers to pull it through. Make sure it is properly seated and use some kind of lubricant to install it more easily because you don?t want to deal with any more leaks once the job is done.9. Reinstall/Inflate TireInflate your tire to the appropriate pressure. You can find the recommended psi on the driver?s side door jamb. If the tire doesn?t want to inflate by itself:  Press the tire back over the rim until the bead clears the edge. Work around the wheel while inflating the tire until the tire is properly seated.If you rotated the tires on the wheel by mistake or installed a heavier or lighter tire valve stem, you have to rebalance the tires.10. Check for LeaksBefore you mount the tire back on the vehicle, it?s best to check for leaks. Use your spray bottle with the soapy solution and apply it all around the tire valve stem. If there are no air bubbles coming out, you are good to go.Reinstall the tire back on the vehicle. Once the lug nuts are secure, you can lower the vehicle from the jack stands and put all of your equipment away. "
what are the Replacement Tire Valve Stem Cost?	"If you can replace the valve stem yourself, it might only cost $5-$10. The process will take some of your time, which must be factored in. On the other hand, if you choose to go to a tire shop for valve stem replacement, you might spend $25 or more. Plus, you will have to wait for customers that arrived before you, so it could actually take longer to accomplish."
How to Fix a Flat Tire Without a Spare?	"The safest option when you have a flat tire without a spare is to call roadside assistance and have the car towed to a tire repair shop. However, if you want to do it yourself, you could also choose the factory-provided tire repair kit, an aftermarket tire plug kit, or Fix-a-Flat, but there are downsides to each of these options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Below is some more detailed information on how to fix a flat tire without a spare.1. Call Roadside AssistanceIf you drive a newer vehicle with a warranty, you might also have a roadside assistance plan. These free services make it simple to get the help you need with a flat tire. Even if it?s not included, you might pay extra to use roadside assistance through another company, such as AAA. If so, get out your phone, make the call and wait patiently for the tow truck to arrive.Even if you don?t have a free plan, you might prefer to call a tow truck anyway. It?s the safest option and it doesn?t have to be too expensive. You might be able to get a tow across a short distance for as little as $50, depending on where you are. The most difficult part is ensuring you are safely off of the road while you wait. 2. Use Included Tire Repair KitWhen manufacturers don?t include a spare tire, there?s often some form of repair kit in the vehicle. The kit might include a can of sealant and a small compressor. The sealant can plug a small hole, such as something that occurs after running over a screw or nail. However, this fix is only temporary and it might permanently ruin the tire. Once you put the sealant in the tire, fill it back up to the appropriate air pressure. You can find this figure on the driver?s side door jamb. Drive right to the tire repair shop for a more professional repair. Additionally, don?t forget to replace the kit in case you get another flat tire down the road. 3. Use Tire Plug KitIf you are near an auto parts store, you could pick up a tire plug kit. These kits include sticky rubber material and a tool to plug the hole. If the hole is in the tread of the tire, it might be repairable. Follow the instructions on the pack to get the rubber material perfectly secured in the hole. You will also need to fill the tire back up with air because you don?t want to drive on a flat tire. Here are some basic instructions that should get you back on the road.Find the puncture hole.If there?s an object still in the tire, carefully remove it.Create a clean-looking hole with the reaming tool. Put the plug on the tool with the adhesive material and force it down into the hole.Carefully pull the tool back out to secure the plug.The tire plug isn?t considered a permanent fix. It?s always best to have a professional take a look at the work you?ve done to ensure integrity. 5. Apply Fix-a-Flat SealantIf your vehicle doesn?t have a spare tire or the equipment to repair it, you can purchase Fix-a-Flat at a local auto parts store. Some people even choose to keep a can in the car for these emergencies. This product works just like the factory tire repair kit, so you should be familiar with it. The slime or foam substance in the can is pushed into the tire to seal up small holes. Plus, air pressure is forced into the tire to re-inflate it. However, Fix-a-Flat can be messy. Many of the best tire shops won?t work with a tire once you?ve used the product and there could be an additional charge if they have to clean up the rim for you. However, if the tire isn?t going to be salvageable anyway, it could be a cheap way to get you to the shop. "
what are the Causes of Inner Tire Wear ?	"The most common cause of inner tire wear is poor wheel alignment, whether it is a bad camber angle or the wrong toe angle. However, the alignment issues can also be caused by defective control arm bushings, worn-out ball joints or bad suspension components that are leading to wear. Here are some more different causes of inner tire wear:1. Bad Camber AnglesDuring a wheel alignment, the camber angle is always checked. This measurement looks at the lean of the tire, whether it is outward or inward, from a front or back view. When it?s labeled as positive camber, it means the tire is angled out from the upper end. On the other hand, the negative camber means the tire is facing inward towards the car. Too much negative camber angle will cause inner tire wear.2. Wrong Toe AngleThe toe angle describes how the tires sit in relation to each other, as well as the car?s center axis. This angle is observed from the front of the vehicle, looking at both tires? edges. The toe-in condition means that both tires are pointing inward at each other, while the toe-out condition shows them facing outward. When the toe-out is severe, you will see a good amount of wear happening to the inside edges of the tire, as the rubber is being drug along the road surface.3. Defective Control Arm BushingsThe control arms provide the link for connection between the steering knuckles and chassis. There are usually upper and lower control arms, both fitted with elastomer and rubber bushings to serve as a pivot point with the chassis. When the control arm bushings get older, they deteriorate. This condition allows play at the chassis junction, which changes the camber angles. What you get is uneven wear that occurs most frequently on the inner surface. 4. Bad Inner or Outer Tie Rod EndThe tie rods control the steering of your vehicle. When you turn the steering wheel, it will push the steering knuckle and your car will therefore turn. There are two types of tie rods on your car, one is bolted to the steering knuckle or spindle and the other is placed more against the steering rack.If one of these gets worn, it will cause the wheel alignment to fall out of place and it will result in inner or outer tire wear. You can raise the front wheels with a floor jack and rub and try to move the front tires to see if you can feel any play when you try to rock them.5. Worn-out Ball JointsWhen the ball joints wear out, the alignment can also suffer and uneven tire wear will occur. If the inner tire is wearing out, it?s probably related to the lower ball joints.This ball and socket design is needed to hold the control arms onto the steering knuckles. When the ball joints are in good shape, there?s no problem. However, the ball joints age and allow for more play as time goes on. This play creates outward movement of the steering knuckle, causing a change to the camber angle. 6. Bad Suspension ComponentsThere are many aspects to the suspension that can cause inner tire wear. For example, if the springs or shocks aren?t absorbing road vibration the way they should, your tires won?t run across the surface the way they should. If you notice tire wear after installing a lift kit, it could be due to not getting the wheels aligned. Whenever you mess with the suspension system, you should realign the wheels."
How to Reduce Inner Tire Wear?	"1. Get Regular Wheel AlignmentIt?s important to have the wheel aligned every 6,000 miles or yearly. As you drive, the wheels hit multiple road imperfections that can throw the alignment out of whack. Before a wheel alignment, the mechanic will also check the suspension parts to see if anything needs to get replaced before.If you are getting a regular wheel alignment, you won?t have to worry about inner tire wear. You also know you are protecting the suspension parts for a better ride. 2. Maintain Proper Tire PressureWhen you run your vehicle with low tire pressure, you put them at risk for inner tire wear. Whenever the sidewall can?t support the weight of the vehicle, it forces unusual parts of the tire to contact the road surface. That?s why you should check the tire pressures often. We recommend checking the tire pressures monthly or any time that the temperature dramatically changes. You can find the recommended pressure on the driver?s side door jamb. 3. Balance the TiresIf you are like most drivers, you forget to have the tires balanced until wear sets in. By then, it might be too late, so it?s best to have it checked periodically. At a minimum, you should have the tires balanced every two or three years. You also want to have them balanced when a new set is installed.The tire balancing only takes a few minutes to complete. Plus, it helps create a better ride that absorbs bumps and imperfections better. 4. Replace Worn Suspension ComponentsIf the suspension parts are worn, it will have a dramatic effect on the ride and how the tires wear. If you notice just one tire is wearing unevenly, it could be due to a defective suspension part. However, regular checks on the suspension could help you avoid this condition.As soon as you see something is wrong, replace the part. In some cases, you can have a repair, while other times, the part needs to be removed for a new one. Either way, suspension issues can create unsafe driving conditions, so you don?t want to take your chances."
Other Tire Wear Pattern Issues !	"1. Edge Shoulder WearWhen the tires are underinflated, the tire edges make more contact with the street, causing them to wear faster. You can prevent this by keeping the tires at the proper pressure.If you notice the edge wear on both shoulders, it?s possible that you are cornering too hard. It can also mean the last tire rotation wasn?t performed properly. 2. Center WearMost often, these tires are overinflated. When there?s too much air inside the tires, the center of the tread is making too much contact with the road. Driving with overinflated tires can be just as dangerous as underinflated. Maintain proper tire pressures to prolong their life and remain safe. 3. CuppingIf there are dips in the tread or you see some smooth spots randomly on the tire, there could be an issue with the suspension. Either a part is bent or worn out. It?s possible that you recently hit a pothole or curb that caused damage. By replacing the parts, you might be able to avoid further issues. 4. Diagonal or Patchy WearWhen the tires exhibit patches of wear, it shows that they aren?t balanced. As the tires jump across the surface of the road, they will wear unevenly. You want to have them rotated, balanced and aligned. These services will keep the tires from wearing any further in a strange pattern."
Can I Patch a Hole in the Sidewall of a Tire?	"No. If there is a leak or hole in the sidewall, you should not consider patching or plugging it. Sidewall repair should not be attempted because it can degrade the integrity of the tire, leaving you compromised on the road. Because the sidewall flexes, a repair is more likely to fail.Your safety becomes more compromised when you start to travel at higher speeds or operate your vehicle at higher temperatures. A sidewall patch is susceptible to blowouts and leaks, which is why most reputable tire shops will not perform the repair. The best solution to a damaged sidewall is always to replace the tire, even if it?s just a small nail. Yes, it will cost you more upfront, but what are the price that will be paid if you get into a deadly accident because of a tire blowout? There?s no comparison. On the bright side, punctures to the sidewall are not nearly as common as tread damage, so it?s likely that your tire is repairable. If you are unsure whether a tire should be repaired or not, it?s best to have a professional tire shop take a look at it. "
what are a Tire Patch?	"The tire patch is a piece of rubber that contains an adhesive backing. This adhesive side sticks to the inside of the tire, creating a seal around the puncture. Tire puncture repair is also done with tire plugs. These plugs are a strip of material that gets coated with a rubber compound before it is put inside the hole. This plug will seal to the inside of the tire, stopping air from seeping out of the tire.The tire patch is normally stronger and more reliable than the tire plug. However, it does take more work to apply a tire patch than it does a plug. Many tire shops use a hybridized tire plug and patch design that incorporates both for better repair. "
When Can a Tire be Repaired?	"For a tire puncture to be repaired, it must meet certain criteria. While some people will attempt to repair punctures in other circumstances, it?s not always recommended. Reputable tire shops will only patch or plug a tire that matches these criteria:Puncture occurs in the tread area. The puncture cannot be in the sidewall part of the tire. In fact, the puncture must be 1? from the sidewall to be safely repaired. Puncture is ¬? or smaller in diameter. Anything larger than this is not repairable.The angle of the puncture is 45 degrees or more.There?s not an overlapping repair to the new puncture.The tire wasn?t driven without air, causing sidewall damage.If all of these requirements can?t be met, there should be no repair. Instead, a tire replacement would be the only safe option. Depending on the condition of your other tires, you might need to replace more than one to keep things uniform. However, if these requirements are met, you can repair it. Follow the advice of most professional tire shops and use a patch-plug kit for the best results. "
How Long Does a Tire Repair Last?	"If you use a tire plug, it might last seven to ten years when care is taken and the repair is done properly. It?s designed to last a minimum of 25,000 miles. However, for the plug to be successful there must be a proper seal between the material and the tire tread. Patches could last a little longer and are generally seen as the more reliable option. It could last the life of the tire as long as the repair is performed properly. If you get the patch installed at a shady shop or it?s done in a place where it doesn?t belong, it could fail prematurely, leaving you with bigger troubles. Ideally, you would combine the two for the best fix. Use a plug and patch for maximum protection."
Is It Dangerous to Drive with Low Tire Pressure?	"Yes, it?s dangerous to drive with low tire pressure. When the tire pressures get too low, you are putting yourself at risk of a blowout. Additionally, low tire pressure causes performance issues and leads to poor fuel economy. It can also create premature wear to the tires, causing you to replace them more often. "
What I Do When Tire Pressure is Low ?	"The first thing you obviously should do when your tire pressure is low is to inflate it as soon as possible. However, if you are far away from a place to do it, here are some other things you should consider:1. Put On SpareIf you are driving on a low tire and can?t get air right away, your best bet is always to swap out the tire for a spare. While it?s inconvenient to pull over and put a spare on, it?s the only way to guarantee your safety.Hopefully, you know how to put a spare tire on. Otherwise, you might need to call for roadside support to get back on the road.2. Turn on FlashersIf you decide you need to keep going, you must put safety first. Take every step possible to ensure your on-road safety.By turning on the hazard flashers, you ensure that your vehicle stands out on the road. The flashers allow you to slow down on the road, while others remain aware that there?s a problem so they can stay away from you. 3. Remove Heavy CargoWith an excessive amount of weight in the vehicle, you put your safety even more at risk. If you are able to remove some of the weight before driving, you should.If you are at home or work, consider taking out some items you don?t need. You can always reload after you get the tire filled back up. 4. Drive Short DistancesIf you are going to drive at all, it shouldn?t be for long. We understand that it doesn?t make sense to put a spare tire on if the gas station is just down the block.The longer you drive, the more risk you face. For this reason, you must weigh the distance carefully to determine if it?s worth the risk. 5. Slow DownEven if you are only driving down the block, you must reduce the car?s speed. Don?t follow the posted speed limit signs as your guideline. The slower you travel, the less chance something bad can happen. With your flashers on, it doesn?t matter how slow you go; others will notice that they should move around you."
Reasons to Avoid Driving with Low Tire Pressure?	"1. Risk of BlowoutTire BlowoutThe most dangerous thing that could happen because of the low tire pressure is a blowout. When the tire becomes underinflated, the sidewalls flex more than they should. As you head down the highway without stopping, the tires heat up and don?t cool down. This excessive heat can cause the tire to blow out, especially when they are softer. Plus, the soft tire is more susceptible to being punctured by debris on the road. 2. Performance IssuesAs the sidewalls flex from the under inflation, you will notice issues while driving. The most obvious issues happen when braking or cornering. The tires are less stable in this condition. Plus, you will lose traction and grip on slippery surfaces. The steering also becomes sloppy, all of which makes the vehicle harder to control. 3. Poor Fuel EconomyWhen the tires are under-inflated, more energy is needed to keep the car moving. It?s the same concept that is seen if you try to ride a bicycle with a flat tire. You will have to pedal harder to get moving.Because there is more resistance, your car engine has to work harder to keep the vehicle moving. This added energy means less fuel efficiency, causing you to spend more time at the fuel pump. 4. Premature WearOuter Tire WearWhen you drive a tire with low air pressure, you allow the tread to wear unevenly. You may see these tread issues on the outer and inner sides of the tire. This abnormal wear cannot be corrected. Considering that you can usually inflate the tires for free, it doesn?t make sense to drive it under-inflated. The other option is to buy tires more often, which is going to cost you a good amount. "
 Which Is Better Tire Patch or Tire Plug ?	"Tire plugs are easier and faster to use, while tire patches will create a better and long-sustainable result. In some states, it?s only legal to repair a tire if both the plug and patch are used. Otherwise, the tire might need to be replaced. However, to determine exactly whether tire plugs or tire patches are better, you need to look at your individual situation. Read on to learn more about how to decide which one is a better choice for you."
What are Tire Plugs?	"The tire plug is a short strip of material that?s covered with a rubber compound to create a seal. When it is forced into the puncture hole, it fills it out while the rubber substance seals it. To finalize the seal, you may need to use some heat to get a tight grip.Plug repairs are simple to do and the tire doesn?t need to come off of the wheel. These tire repairs are also inexpensive. When done right, the plug can last for the lifetime of the tire. Additionally, you can do it yourself at home, as long as you have the special tool that gets the plug inside the rubber. This tool comes as part of the kit with the plugs. On the flip side, there?s always the chance that the plug could fail. If this happens, your on-road safety is compromised. In most cases, the plug only fails because the hole was too large for a plug to be effective. It can also fail if you try to plug an irregular-shaped hole, which should have been patched instead. "
When Can/Can?t a Tire Plug Be Used?	"The main factor when using a tire plug is the location of the puncture and its size. You can use plugs when the puncture from a small screw or nail goes into the tread. However, you shouldn?t use a tire plug under these conditions:Hole is near the sidewall.Hole is irregularly shaped.Hole is too large from a thick nail.If the tire was driven on while flat because the sidewall could be damaged. If a bulge or bubble is on the sidewall."
What are Tire Patches?	"The tire patch contains an adhesive on one side that gets placed inside the rubber. When heated up, the material vulcanizes for a solid seal. This is considered a stronger repair, but it?s not quite as easy as the tire plug. You need to dismount the tire, which is why many people choose to take it to a shop. The process will also take longer because of the added work involved. This added time leads to a higher cost. Some people believe that the tire patch is overkill for smaller puncture holes that could have otherwise been plugged. However, there?s no such thing as doing too much for your safety. "
When Can/Can?t a Tire Patch Be Used?	"The tire patch is an ideal option for holes that are irregularly shaped. However, you still want the puncture to be small, ideally less than a quarter-inch in diameter. Still, you won?t be able to use these patches on larger punctures and you want to keep them away from the sidewall. Here are some other times to avoid using a tire patch:Puncture is too large.Puncture is by sidewall or near another repair.If the tire?s sidewalls are already damaged, such as from driving on them while flat.There?s a bulge or bubble in the rubber."
How to Plug a Car Tire ?	"1. Find the LeakYou don?t need to take the tire off of the rim to plug the hole. Pump up the tire until it gets firm. Listen for a leak. Sometimes, it?s not hard to find, especially if there is a screw or nail in the rubber.Otherwise, fill up a spray bottle with 80 percent water and 20 percent dish soap. Spray the solution over the tire until you see bubbles coming out of the leak location. With a set of pliers, you can remove the object that caused the puncture. 2. Ream the HoleStick the T-handle tool from the kit into the hole. Move it up and down a few times as you rotate it. This creates more space for the plug to seal. Make sure the hole is uniform and round. If the hole is too small to get the tool inside, you can use a smaller drill bit to get started. 3. Prepare Your PlugRemove the plug from the kit. Put it into the eyelet of the insertion tool. You can use a pair of pliers to get it pulled through. Coat the plug in the tire sealing cement that comes with the kit. Use this sealant in the tire?s hole as well. 4. Insert StripPush the insertion tool into the hole with the cement-slathered plug attached. You may need to use a little pressure to get the job done.With an inch of the strip sticking out from the surface of the tire, pull the handle of your tool straight up. This should remove the plug from the tool, where it stays in the tire. 5. Fill TireHook up the air compressor and fill up the tire. You won?t want to fill it to maximum capacity until you realize there is no leak.Use your soapy water once again to look for leaks. If all looks well, you can fill it up the rest of the way. 6. Trim the PlugWipe off any tire sealing cement from the plug area with a paper towel. Allow the substance to harden for about five minutes. With a set of wire cutters, take off the top of the plug. There should be no more than 1/8? sticking out."
When to Replace the Tire?	"While it?s important to save money, you don?t want to do so at the expense of your safety. If the puncture hole is too large or it is near the sidewall, it?s time to get a new tire. Additionally, you don?t want to repair anything that?s located near another repair.Furthermore, if you drove on the tire while it was flat, you must get a new one. There?s a chance that the sidewall got damaged, which could lead to a blow-out down the road."
How Much Does A Tire Patch Cost?	"On average, it will cost you between $30 and $60 to patch a tire. The cost depends on how large the puncture is and where you live. Some parts of the country have higher labor rates than others. If you do the tire patch yourself, you can save money, but you need special tools. "
Causes of Low Tire Pressure Light is On with Correct Tire Pressure ?	"If your low tire pressure light is on even if the tire pressure is fine, you may need to reset the TPMS. It can also be due to a faulty TPMS sensor. However, the sensor battery might also be dead or the TPMS receiver could be damaged. If you have an indirect TPMS system, the problem could be due to the loss of traction. "
what are the problems that Causes of Low Tire Pressure Light is On with Correct Tire Pressure ?	"1. Faulty or Unprogrammed Tire Pressure SensorIf you corrected the tire pressure, but the TPMS light is still on, you may need to reset the TPMS system with either a scanner or check the procedure for your specific car model. Sometimes the tire pressure sensors lose the programmed data and you may need to use an OBD2 scanner or TPMS Reset tool to reprogram the TPMS sensor if everything else seems fine.The TPMS sensor can also be easily damaged, which causes the light to remain on. The problem with a faulty sensor is that it isn?t monitoring the tire pressures, putting you at risk.The sensor can be damaged due to debris or contaminants. It can also be damaged during the mounting and dismounting of the tires, as special care is needed to ensure the sensors are protected. 2. Dead Battery in SensorDirect monitoring TPMS sensors need batteries to operate correctly. These batteries are made to last a long time, but they can still fail. On average, the batteries might fail every five to ten years. If the battery dies, there can?t be any feedback through the system. This breakdown in communication causes the light to come on. 3. Defective TPMS ReceiverThis issue isn?t as common as the other two, but it can happen. The receiver of the TPMS can fail, leading to a loss of pressure data from the tires. There?s no rhyme or reason as to why this happens occasionally, other than it?s electronic equipment that can be fallible. It won?t matter what pressure is in each tire, the TPMS light will come on. 4. Traction LossIf your car uses an indirect TPMS configuration, any loss of traction could cause the light to come on. These systems use the wheel speed sensor information to tell when there?s a problem with the tire pressures.However, when traction is lost, the sensors could determine the cause is low tire pressure, even when it?s not. This problem can lead to some confusion, especially when the light comes on and off periodically. "
How to Fix TPMS Light ?	"1. Fill Tire with AirThe most obvious solution is to fill the low tire with the right amount of air. When the light comes on, you should always start by checking the tire pressures.You can compare the reading with the recommended air pressure by looking at the driver?s side door jamb. If the light remains on despite the pressures being right, you have to move on to our other tips.2. Repair FaultThe repair you continue with depends on what are causing the fault. If you don?t have the equipment to figure out what?s wrong, you should visit a qualified mechanic.If the car needs a simple TPMS sensor, you might spend between $75 and $250 for the part and labor. In most cases, a dead battery will also require a new sensor replacement. If the receiver needs to be replaced, the price is going to be slightly more. If you have the equipment to work on these sensors and receivers, you could perform the repair yourself. By doing so, you cut out the expense of the labor charge. 3. Reset LightIf the light has come on because there was a problem after wheel rotation or another service, you may just need to reset the light. Most manufacturers have a simple way to reset the warning light. You can find it in your owner?s manual.There might be a reset button in your car?s glove compartment or in the menu of your car settings. However, you need to know how long to press the button and what steps are necessary to get the job done. "
what are the difference between  Direct and Indirect TPMS?	"1. DirectThe direct TPMS is used in most cars on the road today. With this design, all four wheels have a sensor that feeds information back to the computer. If the tire pressure gets low, a signal is sent and the alert comes on the dashboard.Because of where the sensors are located, there can be damage to them when driving on harsh road conditions, such as dirt driveways or during service. They also go bad simply because of old age, requiring replacement over time.2. IndirectSome manufacturers prefer the indirect system, which doesn?t use a sensor on each wheel. Instead, the TPMS runs from the sensors on the anti-lock brakes. These sensors determine when the rotation speed is slow, indicating that tire pressure might be low.The indirect TPMS is considered more durable than the normal system because it doesn?t fail as often. However, you aren?t going to know if multiple tires are running low since there aren?t separate sensors. Up until now, it?s only been some Asian and European automakers that have chosen this TPMS configuration. However, other automakers are discussing switching over, making it more of a standard option across the board. "
What Does It Mean When The Tire Pressure Light Is Blinking?	"A blinking tire pressure light can come on because of low tire pressure or trouble with the tire pressure sensor. It can also be caused because of a repair that was made without performing the necessary reset. You also want to consider that the car battery is dead and needs to be replaced. In some cases, these problems are going to lead to a solid tire pressure light. Other times, the issue or fault leads the light to blink. Each manufacturer uses different methods to tell you what the problem is. You can find more information in the owner?s manual. Additionally, some vehicles will give you a read-out on what tire is to blame by looking at the infotainment center."
what are the Causes Of A Blinking Tire Pressure Light ?	"It?s important to know why the light is on if you hope to fix it. In most cases, a blinking tire pressure light issue stems from a lack of pressure or a malfunctioning tire pressure sensor. With a quick diagnosis, you can tell what are causing the problem.Here are some of the common issues leading to a tire pressure light that blinks. 1. Low Tire PressureCheck Tire PressureWhen tire pressures fall, the light comes on to alert you to the danger. This process is the normal operation of the sensor, doing exactly what it was intended to do. Tire pressure can fall because of a leak or failure. It can also decrease over time.One major reason why tire pressures drop is because of a change in temperature. When the outside temperature drops or rises dramatically, the tire pressures can change. For this reason, it?s recommended to keep a close eye on tire pressures, especially during season changes. When temperatures aren?t changing, you should still check the pressures regularly. It?s often recommended to test them once a month before you do any driving because that?s when the tires are cold. 2. Tire Pressure Sensor Lost MemoryTire pressure sensors rely on a battery to operate. If the warning light begins to flash, you may need to have a tire pressure sensor battery replaced. These dead batteries lead to a loss of memory, making it impossible for the sensor to work as intended. Until the battery is replaced, the tire pressure isn?t being read and you are in danger, especially if one tire starts to lose pressure and you don?t know it. In some tire pressure sensors, the battery is not replaceable and you need to replace the whole sensor instead.3. Faulty Tire Pressure SensorTire Pressure SensorThere?s also the chance that the sensor itself has gone bad. These little sensors are located at every tire and are prone to wear over time. Thankfully, it?s not difficult to have a sensor replaced, allowing it to read tire pressures once again. A qualified tire shop can tell which sensor is bad and replace it quickly.4. Changed Wheels Without ResetChange WheelsIf you recently made changes to the wheels or tires, there could be a malfunction with the sensor. When work is done, the sensors need to be reset to work correctly. Most importantly, if you put a new wheel size on the car or you change what type of tires you use, a reset must occur. It?s possible that you forgot to reset them or the tire shop overlooked this step. Either way, there?s nothing mechanically wrong and a simple reset is all that?s needed. 5. Tire Pressure Sensor Not ResetAdditionally, when a new tire pressure sensor is installed, a reset will also be required. This is part of the normal steps to replacing the sensor, but it still gets overlooked.Without the reset, the sensor cannot read the valuable information. Therefore, the light blinks, letting you know there?s a problem. You can have it professionally reset or follow the DIY procedures laid out in some service manuals. 6. Bad Car BatteryThe car battery and alternator are responsible for powering up all of the electronics in the vehicle. If the battery starts to die, it can cause many of the electronics to go haywire, including the tire pressure sensor light.With the blinking light, you should also notice other electrical issues at the same time. For that reason, this is one of the most rare occurrences for a single flashing light, but still possible. "
How To Fix A Blinking Tire Pressure Light?	" 1. Correct The Tire PressureIn the majority of cases, you simply need to add some air to the tires. Check the driver?s side door panel to see what the right tire pressure is for your vehicle. With that information in hand, you can check the tires to make sure they match.If they don?t match, add the right amount of air. Once the proper air pressure is reached, the light should stop blinking on its own. 2. Reset Tire Pressure LightTpms ButtonIf the tire pressure light needs to be reset, there are multiple ways to handle this procedure. With some vehicles, the light can simply be reset by pressing the appropriate button. You can find this location by reading the owner?s manual. There?s also a TPMS tool that is used by many shops to reset the light.Beyond that, here are some steps that can be done at home with compatible models. Drive the vehicle at 50 mph or more for at least ten minutes. This should cause the tire pressure to reset when you start the car again.You can also turn the key until it reaches the ON setting without starting the engine. Hold the reset button down until the light blinks three times. Start the car and see if it is reset.Inflate the tires slightly beyond where they should be, then deflate them. Once deflated, reinflate every tire until it reaches its recommended amount. In some cars, this will reset the sensor. Some people prefer to disconnect the battery to provide a hard reset to the sensor memory. If you choose to do this, you will need to reset everything that has a memory, including your stereo presets and clock. 3. Read Trouble CodesIf there are other lights on the dashboard, you can read the trouble codes to determine what?s going on. With a mechanical malfunction, you might see another light with the TPMS light.However, not all code scanners are equipped to read the TPMS light. For this reason, you may need to visit a tire shop for a better analysis. 4. Replace & Reprogram Tire Pressure SensorsTpms Sensor ProgrammingIt?s possible that new tire pressure sensors need to be installed and programmed. Because of where the tire pressure sensors sit, dirt and debris can corrode them over time.As an electrical piece of equipment, any malfunction can lead to failure. These sensors aren?t difficult to replace and only take a few minutes to reprogram with the right tools. 5. Replace The Car BatteryIf the electrical issues seem to be widespread, the car may need a new battery. You can have the battery checked at a local auto parts store to see how it?s holding up.If the battery was to blame, the light should reset once a new one is installed. Otherwise, you may need to move on to the next step. 6. Contact A ProfessionalIf you can?t figure out the problem or feel it?s too complicated for your skill level, don?t hesitate to reach out to a professional. Most tire pressure sensor lights can be dealt with by a tire shop.If you have an appointment, it shouldn?t take long to have a sensor replaced or reset. You may only need to spend an hour or less of labor to get the job done. "
Can I drive with a blinking tire pressure light?	"When the tire pressure light comes on, it tells you there?s a problem that shouldn?t be ignored. If a tire loses pressure, it could cause an on-road accident. For this reason, it should always be checked out immediately. Even if you choose to continue driving because you know there?s not a major problem, you won?t know if another tire starts to lose pressure, putting you at risk. "
How do you fix a blinking tire pressure light?	"You start by checking the tire pressures and adjusting them as needed. If the tire pressures are fine, you may need to reset or replace a sensor. You can also read the trouble codes with a compatible OBDII scanner or swap out a dying battery to resolve the issue. "
What does it mean when the tire pressure light blinks then stays on?	"In many cases, it?s your car telling you that the pressure is wrong in one or more tires. You can check the pressures and fill up the offending tire to turn off the light. Otherwise, there could be a mechanical failure that requires more in-depth diagnosis and repair. "
Is it safe to drive with a blinking tire pressure light?	"We recommend resolving the blinking tire pressure light immediately. If the tire needs air, it?s safer to inflate it to the proper pressure before driving anymore. Even if there?s a minor issue that can be dealt with later, you won?t know if a tire starts losing pressure while this light is on for something else. For the cost of repairs, there?s no reason to procrastinate. "
How can I find the correct tire pressure for my car ?	"1. Check the label behind the driver?s doorCar Tire Pressure LabelOn almost all car models, you will find a label when you open the driver?s door. The tire pressure for the original tire sizes and how much you should inflate the tire depending on your vehicle?s load weight is often listed here.Some cars do not have this label, and in this case, you have to try an alternative.2. Check Service ManualCar ManualAlmost always, when you buy a car, you will get a service manual describing your car?s basic functions. This manual is often located in the glove box together with the other documents. In this manual, you can often find what fluids you should fill your car with and your car?s recommended tire pressure.If you can?t find this service manual, it is time to go to the next step.3. VIN decoderVin DecoderThere are a lot of free VIN decoders out there on the internet. The downside of this is that you need to find the VIN of your car first. You can often find the VIN of your car below the front windshield, in the trunk, or under the hood.On some US car part sites, you can also enter your license plate number to get your VIN and use it to find the correct tire pressure for your car.4. Call Your Authorized DealerCall Car DealerIf you are not sure of finding the correct tire pressure by using the methods above, you can always call your authorized dealer for your car model?s brand.They can often get the correct tire pressure within the blink of an eye, and you will not have to spend any more effort to find it."
What does cold tire inflation pressure mean?	"On the tire pressure labels, you will often find something named ?cold tire inflation pressure.? What does this actually mean, and will it really make a difference?You need to know that the tire pressure differs greatly in your tires depending on the tire?s air temperature. When you are driving for long distances, especially in warm weather, the friction will create a lot of heat in your tires, which will also add a lot of pressure.So, what happens if you inflate the tires to 36 psi / 2.5 bar directly after this? It will probably sink to 32 psi / 2.2 bar when the tires cool down, and this will cause you to drive around with too low pressure when they are cold.This is why it is listed as cold tire inflation pressure, and also why you should always inflate the tires when they are cold."
Is it better to have slightly lower or higher tire pressure than recommended?	"I often recommend inflating your tires with 1?2 PSI or 0.07?0.14 above the recommended tire pressure. This is because many modern cars have a tire pressure monitoring system, and these sensors are susceptible.For example, in some cars, there is only a small difference between the recommended pressure and the pressure your TPMS system considers to be too low. The TPMS system is sensitive to this difference, and you can easily end up with a TPMS warning light on your dashboard.As you may know, the tire pressure can differ depending on temperature, and to make sure the tire pressure light will not come on directly after you inflate your tire, you should have a slight pressure above the recommended.Having too high pressure is always better than too low tire pressure."
How can I find the tire pressure with aftermarket rims or tire size on my car?	"To find the tire pressure, if you have aftermarket rims or tires, you can either ask the place that sold the tires for the most accurate pressure, or check this list down below for a very general tire pressure chart. This is just a list you should use for a thumb rule and not a recommended tire pressure.Small Car; normal tire size: (around 185/55 ? 15) ~ 2.1 bar  (30 psi)Medium Car; normal tire size: (around 195/55 ? 16) ~ 2.5 bar (36 psi)Large car; normal tire size: (around 245/55 ? 18) 2.9 bar (42 psi)In general, if you have bigger rims with a lower tire profile, you should use a higher tire pressure."
what are the correct tire pressure for my car?	"There is no unique question about correct tire pressure, as this varies depending on the car. For instance, pickup trucks and full-scale SUVs have their tires inflated to a much higher pressure than those on small hatchbacks. Furthermore, higher tire pressure is needed when having luggage and other loads inside the trunk or the vehicle?s roof. You can find exact and accurate tire pressure values for your car on a label inside the driver?s door. Alternatively, you can look up this information in the owner?s manual or on the Internet."
Is 40 psi tire pressure good?	"40 PSI is likely to be the correct tire pressure for a large SUV or a car with low-profile tires. In addition, rear tires might have to be inflated to this pressure when driving with a fully loaded trunk. These, however, are not universal values, as recommended tire pressures differ depending on the make and model. Inflating the tires to the recommended pressure is vital for the car?s safety and performance."
Is 36 psi too high for tires?	"If you?re driving a medium-sized vehicle, 36 PSI is most likely to be the correct tire pressure. This is especially true if the car rides on 16-inch wheels and 205/55 R16 tires. However, this pressure would be too high for most compact cars, as these are usually fitted with smaller tires. On the other hand, tires on large SUVs and pickup trucks would be slightly underinflated at this pressure, as these usually run at 40 PSI."
What tire pressure is too low?	"Strictly speaking, tire pressure is considered too low when its value is below the level recommended by the car manufacturer. The information about exact tire pressures can typically be found on a sticker inside the driver?s side door or in the owner?s manual. In addition, most modern cars have a tire pressure monitoring system, or TPMS, which continually monitors the pressure in all four tires. If any of them becomes underinflated, the TMPS will warn the driver with an appropriate message."
what are the Symptoms that I have  A Bad Tire Pressure Sensor (TPMS) ?	"The most common symptom of a bad tire pressure sensor is a TPMS warning light on your dashboard. You could also notice other indirect signs, like low air pressure in the tires or incorrect warnings on your dashboard.A sensor is an electrical component and therefore something that can deteriorate with age. Not only that, but an irregular power supply, dirt, heat, and dust can greatly affect the sensor?s performance. There are some noticeable changes to the car when this happens.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing tire pressure sensor (TPMS) to look for:1. Low Air Pressure in the TiresLow Air Pressure Tires E1609807654698The function of the tire pressure sensor is to alert you when the tire is low. So if you find that your tires are flat or you have difficulty driving your car, the tire pressure sensor has failed or is not working properly. The sensor must be in proper operating condition to make a correct assessment.Therefore, if you do not see warning signs on your dashboard, you must have the sensor checked by a certified mechanic. Check your tire pressure with a Tire Pressure Gauge.2. TPMS Warning Light IlluminatesTpms Sensor Light E1609807663425The ECU or PCM, which receives all the sensors? information, triggers a warning on your dashboard indicating that something is wrong with the sensors.If a sensor, such as a tire pressure sensor, is not operating by the standard, the ECU illuminates the TPMS light.Consult a mechanic to diagnose the real reason for the TPMS symbol. You may also receive the message ?Tire pressure sensor fault? on your dashboard.3. Incorrect WarningsTire Pressure Light E1609807673133If the tire pressure sensor is not functioning properly, you may receive improper warnings on the DIC. The sensor could indicate that you have a flat tire, even if there is nothing wrong with the tire. It may also indicate low tire pressure even if you have recently inflated the tires to the optimum pressure. However, these warnings should not be taken lightly as they may cause future problems."
Where is Tire Pressure Sensor Location?	"The tire pressure sensor is located inside your car?s tires, attached to the inner part of the rim, the opposite side of the tire valve. You have one tire pressure sensor per wheel.You can easily find it by removing the tire from the rim. It looks like a small cylinder."
How to tell which TPMS sensor is bad?	"The easiest way to find out which TPMS sensor has gone bad is to read the trouble codes with an OBD2 Scanner.If your car has a display of each wheel?s tire pressure on the dashboard, you can also check there if some pressure is irrelevant.In most cars you need a diagnostic scan tool that can not only read codes from the TPMS system and not just the ECU. To find a scanner to do it, you can either check our article: Best OBD2 Scanners, or go to a mechanic workshop to do it for you."
what are a Tire Pressure Sensor?	"The tire pressure sensor plays an important role in ensuring that your vehicle remains in perfect condition at all times. It calculates the air pressure in your car?s tires and alerts you if the air pressure is insufficient.The tire pressure sensor contains batteries that are not replaceable, and after some years, they will run out of battery power, requiring you to replace the entire sensor. This is the most common reason why you need to replace them.You can expect the batteries in a tire pressure sensor to last for 5-10 years at least, depending on the brand."
what are the Tire Pressure Sensor Replacement Cost?	"The average tire pressure sensor replacement cost is between $40 and $100 for each sensor. Expect a total of $160 to $500 for all four sensors. A tire pressure sensor costs between $30 to $70 each. The labor cost per tire costs $10 to $30 per tire.Before you decide on replacing your tire pressure sensor, it is best to consider the many mechanics in your area. Not all mechanics are the same, which means that not every person who calls himself a mechanic is actually one. Inexperienced mechanics cost less, so you would naturally be attracted to them for your work.However, this is, frankly, a bad decision that could cost you dearly in the future. It is best to entrust your car problems to a certified mechanic, regardless of the work involved.Remember to always reset the TPMS light after a TPMS sensor replacement.There is also the fluctuating price of the sensor to consider.There is no fixed price for a sensor. Every sensor is different, and every car is different. The price you pay for the tire pressure sensor depends on your car?s make, model, and year.The older the car is, the harder it is to find its part, and the more you pay. The more modern the car, the less you pay. However, this may not always be the case. For example, imported car parts cost more than locally produced parts.Also, the price you pay depends on the number of sensors that need to be replaced. Your car has a tire pressure sensor for each tire, so you can imagine that if two or three sensors are defective, you will easily pay about a thousand dollars for the replacement."
 what are the Causes of a Popping Noise When Turning ?	"The most common reasons for a popping noise when turning are a broken coil spring, a bad strut mount, defective struts, or a bad ball joint. It could also be worn control arm bushings or bad CV joints, all of which can be repaired. Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of a popping noise when turning:1. Broken Coil SpringBad Coil SpringThe coil spring is a vital component of the car suspension. Most cars are equipped with these springs. Coils can last for the lifetime of your vehicle but are also prone to damage, especially if you drive on rough roads.When the coil spring breaks, you?ll hear a popping sound, as well as knocking or clunking. It can also lead to misalignment, causing trouble controlling the vehicle while driving. If left unchecked, the bad springs will further cause tire tread damage. Because you don?t want to replace tires too, it?s best to have this problem resolved as soon as you can. 2. Bad Strut MountSymptoms Of A Bad Strut MountIf your vehicle has a front strut assembly, the mount may have failed. The strut assembly is necessary to dampen the shock from driving on the road. It?s also a pivot point for your car?s steering system.The mount contains a bearing that provides the pivoting function. If the mount is worn, a popping sound is going to be more pronounced when you are making a turn. A bad strut can also lead to tire wear or steering vibrations. 3. Defective StrutsIt?s also possible that the struts have failed. These parts act as the shock absorber in conjunction with the spring coils. Within the strut cylinder, there is gas or liquid, along with a piston.If the strut goes bad or it gets stuck, the suspension won?t absorb impact the same way. While it won?t cause damage to the vehicle, there will be a strange popping noise heard from the wheels. 4. Worn or Damaged Ball JointBall joints are part of the suspension and steering system. They allow the steering knuckles to pivot while turning because the ball joints are connected to the steering knuckle. Tie rods are also part of this system, responsible for transferring motion from the steering gear to the knuckles.If either of these parts fails, you may hear a popping noise or clunking. This noise is more pronounced when you are taking a turn or curve. 5. Worn Control Arm BushingsControl arms connect the suspension to the frame of the vehicle. Attached to the control arms are bushings.When the bushings fail, you will hear a popping, clicking or snapping when you turn the steering wheel. This noise will eventually get worse, possibly becoming a squeaking sound. 6. Bad CV JointsCv Joint CarIf your vehicle is front-wheel drive, it will have constant velocity (CV) axles. These axles transfer the rotational force from the engine to the front wheels via the transaxle. With every CV axle, there is also an outer and inner CV joint.These joints are responsible for allowing the axle shaft to move in the up and down motion while traveling over bumps. The outer joints are also needed for pivoting, allowing the front wheels the movement for turning. When the CV joints begin to wear, you are going to hear popping, snapping or clicking noise when turning and accelerating. "
How To Fix a Popping Noise When Turning?	"1. Determine Which Side It?s Coming FromBefore you get started, consider reading the factory service manual for your vehicle. This manual will show you all of the diagrams and parts that you will be inspecting. Any recommended procedures will also be outlined. To figure out what are going on, you must first determine what side of the car the noise is coming from. If it?s difficult to tell from inside the vehicle, have a friend join you for the ride. Sometimes, it helps to listen from multiple spots in the car while going through turns. The two of you can compare notes and narrow down the location. 2. Inspect Coil Springs and Strut MountMechanic Inspect SuspensionYou must perform a visual check on the coil springs and strut mount. Springs are found near the wheel above the axle. If you lift the vehicle, you?ll be able to see broken springs or strut mounts much easier.However, not all breaks in the spring are easy to notice. If the break occurs in the middle, you may have to do a little more investigation. 3. Inspect Suspension and BushingsNext, you want to inspect the boots and bushings for any signs of wear. As you examine under the vehicle, work at the wheel where you hear the noise first. If the bushings are separating or the suspension appears worn, you want to prepare for replacement. Don?t forget to look for excessive play in the tie rod ends. Begin at the power steering box and move from the arms to the wheels. The tie rod ends are the connection point between the wheels and the power steering box. If the bushings are compromised, you need to replace them. 4. Replace Broken PartsWhatever problem you found through the initial examination should be repaired. In many cases, it?s best to replace suspension parts in pairs. Therefore, if you have a bad coil spring on one side, you may as well replace the other one at the same time. Because the other spring is worn, only installing one can change the ride height and balance of the vehicle.While you are working on the suspension system, it?s best to replace anything that looks worn. For example, if you are replacing springs because one broke, you may also want to inspect the ball joints, bushings and other vital components in case they need replaced as well. If something looks like it may not last much longer, just go ahead and replace it to be safe. 5. Contact a ProfessionalIf you aren?t sure that you can perform the repair yourself, it?s best to get help from a professional mechanic. "
What causes a popping noise when turning?	"You probably have a part failing on the suspension or steering system. It could be due to a bad ball joint, defective struts, a bad strut mount, a broken coil spring, worn control arm bushings or bad CV joints. You need to inspect the system and replace what?s malfunctioning. "
Why is my front end popping?	"Suspension problems can lead to a popping noise in the front end, especially if you are going through a turn. The suspension connects to the steering system, so all of these parts need to be inspected to find the root of the issue. Fix whatever is broken as soon as possible to ensure your on-road safety. "
Why do I hear a clicking noise when I turn my wheel?	"As you turn the steering wheel, you activate numerous steering components and suspension parts. Listen carefully to where the sound is coming from and inspect that side. You?ll probably find a bad ball joint, a defective strut, a broken coil spring, a failing strut mount, bad CV joints or worn control arm bushings."
Do ball joints make noise when turning?	"Yes, worn ball joints make a faint clunking or popping noise that can be intermittent at first. You may hear it more as you go through a turn, coming from the offending side of the vehicle. It can also be pronounced when you hit a dip or bump in the road. "
what are the Causes of Clunking Noise When Driving Over Bumps?	"This clunking noise is normally the result of a worn suspension part, such as a sway bar link, strut, leaf spring shackle, control arm bushings, ball joints, or a shock absorber. It can also be caused by a worn body mount or a malfunction with the steering rack. Here is a more detailed list of the most common reasons for a clunking noise when driving over bumps:1. Bad Sway Bar Links or BushingsSway Bar LinkThe most common cause of a clunking noise coming from your car when you go over bumps is due to worn sway bar links or bushings. These sway bar links have ball joints that will wear over time and cause a clunking noise.Also if the sway bar bushings that are holding the sway bar are worn, it will cause a clunking noise.2. Bad StrutsWorn StrutsStruts are responsible for dampening the bounce in the vehicle and for supporting the structure. However, the struts will eventually fail, which can cause a clunking noise when traveling over a bump. In some cases, the strut housing can also become damaged, especially after an impact. In this case, the noise might be even more pronounced. 3. Failing Shock Absorber Shock absorbers act a lot like struts, but they don?t hold the weight of the vehicle. Because this vital suspension part needs to absorb impact from the wheels, you are sure to hear clunking sounds as they fail.At first, you may only hear a slight tapping noise, which is common when a bushing gets cracked. The car also starts to bounce more when heading over a bump. 4. Worn Leaf Spring ShacklesLeaf springs are primarily used for vehicles that will be heading off-road. You might have them in your SUV or truck. Over time, the leaf springs can break or bend, leading to a clunking noise.Plus, this problem could also occur because of the leaf spring shackle. This is the component holding the leaf spring to the vehicle?s frame. 5. Damaged Control Arm BushingsEven under normal driving conditions, the control arm bushings will eventually wear out. However, if you head off-road or drive down uneven terrain, you could face this failure prematurely. Worn control arm bushings lead to misaligned wheels. Because of the poor alignment, you could hear more clunking as you head over a bump. If the issue extends into the body mount, you could also feel vibration in the cabin. 6. Bad Ball JointsWhen the ball joints fail, it becomes more difficult to properly steer the vehicle straight. Additionally, a damaged ball joint housing can create more sound when going over bumps. The housing is prone to failure if there is debris or grime buildup.Additionally, if the ball moves in and out of the housing due to excessive play, you will also hear noises. This problem commonly leads to a recognizable clunking noise, during certain road conditions. 7. Steering Rack MalfunctionThere are bushings in the steering rack that can also fail over time. If these bushings fail, you might hear a clunking or knocking noise as you head down uneven terrain or a bumpy road. There will also be excessive play in the steering rack if there?s a failure. Because of this, you could face a more difficult time keeping the car under control. 8. Worn Body MountThe body mounts are responsible for securing the vehicle frame to the body. If damage occurs to any of these mounts, you are sure to hear more noises.Not only may you hear noise, but there?s also the chance that something is misaligned. As the body mount bushings fail, you could notice more gaps or cracks in the body where everything was previously lined up correctly. However, these body mounts will almost only be found on trucks with a vehicle frame."
How to Fix Clunking Noise When Driving Over Bumps?	"To fix a car with a clunking noise when driving over bumps, you need to inspect the sway bar links and bushings. You?ll also want to inspect struts, shocks, leaf springs, ball joints, control arm bushings, and other suspension parts.Here is a more detailed list on how to fix a clunking noise when driving over bumps:1. Diagnose/Replace Sway Bar Links and BushingsMechanic Check SuspensionThe first thing you want to do when you hear a clunking noise when going over bumps is to inspect the sway bar links and bushings. To do this, the vehicle must be on a flat surface without raising the car, then you must check the links and bushings.Do not raise the car with a floor jack, as this will cause tension in the links and bushings and you may not know if they are bad or not.2. Diagnose/Replace StrutsWhen you push down on the front and rear of your car, you can see if everything is working as it should. If there strut is damaged, it might pop as it goes up and down. You can also turn the wheels to see if there are any clunking or popping noises.A physical inspection of the strut would be your next step. If you notice oil around the housing, the strut might be leaking, requiring replacement. You also want to inspect the coil springs around the struts.3. Check/Replace Shock AbsorbersCheck the shocks for any sign of damage. You may need to lift the vehicle and use a flashlight to get a good look at the shocks. Some people prefer to try the bounce test. If you push on the vehicle and let it go, it should never bounce more than once before regulating itself. You can also examine the tire tread to see if the shocks are worn out. When shocks start to fail, the tread begins to cup. It?s best to replace the bad shocks as soon as possible to avoid this wear on the tires. 4. Diagnose/Replace Control Arm BushingsWith your flashlight, you can also check the control arm bushings. You can also perform an on-road test, as bad control arm bushings make more noise during a fast take-off or quick stop, as well as over bumps.If you notice damage to the control arms, they need to be replaced. These parts can also become bent or loose. 5. Inspect/Replace Ball JointsYou aren?t going to inspect the ball joints very similarly to the other suspension parts. You won?t be able to look for broken or damaged ball joints with the use of your flashlight.There should be a cotter pin and castle nut with the ball joints. With your pry bar, you should be able to wiggle the ball joint to check for play while the wheels are off of the ground. If there?s too much play, it?s time to replace them. 6. Check/Replace Leaf Spring ShacklesWith a flashlight, you should be able to see the leaf spring shackles and inspect them for damage. In some situations, you may need to raise the vehicle with the help of a floor jack and jack stands.If you notice any damage, bent shackles or parts that are loose, it?s time to replace them. You can also check the mounting bolts at the same time and tighten them with a wrench. 7. Diagnose/Replace Body MountYour car could have as many as eight body mounts, all of which should be inspected when the clunking noise begins. If any mount is damaged, it must be immediately replaced to ensure your vehicle remains intact and secure on the road. If you drive a unibody vehicle, these mounts aren?t present. Instead, the sound could be coming from the subframe holding the rear suspension and engine. 8. Inspect/Replace Steering Rack BushingTo inspect the steering rack, you must jack up the vehicle. Support it properly by putting the jack stands at the appropriate placement points listed in your service manual.Grab the front tire with a hand at three o?clock and the other at nine o?clock. Shake the tire side to side as someone watches the steering rack bushings. If there?s knocking in the tire or you feel strange movements, you want to replace the bushings or the steering rack. Fluid can leak from the steering rack boot, indicating replacement is needed. Thankfully, the bushings don?t usually cost too much. "
Do Ball Joints Clunk Over Bumps?	"When the ball joints begin to fail, it?s normal to hear a clunking noise, but it normally only starts when traveling over bumps and uneven road surfaces. You could also notice a vibration of the wheel and a wandering feeling as you try to maintain control of the vehicle."
How Do I Diagnose Clunking Noise When Driving Over Bumps?	"Start by paying attention to where the sound is coming from. By understanding what part of the car the noise originates from, you will have an easier time hunting down the problem. Inspect the area with your flashlight to determine what?s defective and replace it right away. "
Is It Safe to Drive With a Clunking Noise?	"Once the clunking noise begins, any part of the suspension could be to blame. With a bad suspension, it becomes more difficult to control the vehicle, thereby putting you at risk of an accident. For this reason, and to ensure that the rest of the suspension remains intact, it?s best to replace the problem immediately. "
Why Is My Car Making A Squeaking Noise When Driving?	"The most common reasons why a car is making a squeaking noise when driving are due to a loose belt or that something has malfunctioned in the steering system. It can also be caused by worn brake pads, tire problems, a suspension lacking lubrication and moisture in the morning. Here is a more detailed list of the possible causes of why your car is making a squeaking noise while driving.1. Loose BeltIf you have ever had a loose serpentine belt under the hood, you know how squeaky that can be. This rubber belt is needed to drive the various accessories found around the engine. If you hear the squeaking when you push on the accelerator, it means that the belt is wearing. You don?t want to drive with a worn belt because it could snap at any time. If it breaks, you risk serious engine damage that will cost you much more than a belt to fix. If you hear the squeaking sound immediately after starting the car when it is cold which fades when the engine gets hot, it is a strong sign that the serpentine belt is loose. In some car models, you can tighten the belt with the tensioner.2. Malfunctioning Steering SystemIf you notice the squeaking or whining noise when you are taking a turn, the steering could be to blame. Most often, it?s a lack of power steering fluid. It could also be contaminated. This fluid is needed to keep the steering system lubricated. As it becomes contaminated with debris and dirt, it can no longer do its job effectively. There are also steering parts that could be failing, leading to a squeaking sound. If the fluid looks good and it?s full, you might need to replace the power steering pump instead. 3. Worn Brake PadsSqueaking noises occur when you push on the brake pedal because of worn-out pads. As the wear indicator touches the rotor, squeaking will occur. This is a sign that you want to replace the pads and maybe also the rotors.However, brakes can also squeak when they aren?t worn. If you opt for cheap brakes, the material might be naturally squeaky. For this reason alone, you want to spend a little extra on a good set. 4. Tire ProblemsIt?s possible that your car tires are making the squeaking noise that?s driving you insane. If it sounds like squeaking while turning, the tires might be uneven or worn. It?s also possible that the alignment is off. However, if you hear the squeaking only when driving on a bumpy road, the issue could be loose lug nuts. 5. Suspension Lacks LubricationThere are many moving parts to the car?s suspension. At any time, these parts can lead to squeaks, especially if there is a lack of lubrication.The biggest trouble with having a squeaky suspension is finding what?s causing it. With so many parts involved, it can be difficult to hunt down the culprit. 6. MoistureSometimes, cars just squeak even though nothing is wrong. If you noticed that the grass was wet from moisture overnight, you could expect that the car is dealing with the same dew.This happens most frequently if you live in a humid climate. As you drive, the car might squeak a little as the moisture is burned away. Thankfully, it shouldn?t last long. "
How to Fix a Squeaking Car ?	"1. Replace Serpentine BeltIt doesn?t cost a lot to replace a serpentine belt, but letting it go could lead to massive repair bills. On average, the belt should only cost you about $75. You may need to replace the tensioner while doing so, which could lead to higher costs.If you can get it on yourself, you can avoid the labor charges. However, some serpentine belts can be difficult to get on as some of the tensioners can be tricky to reach. 2. Fill/Replace Power Steering FluidIf the system is low on power steering fluid, a simple fill-up might be all that?s needed. If the fluid looks contaminated, it?s best to flush it out and refill it. The power steering flush only costs between $50 and $150 in most locations.If the power steering pump is defective, a new one is required. You might pay $100 to $200 for the pump itself and another $200-$300 for labor if you can?t put it on at home. 3. Check/Replace BrakesIf you hear squeaking when you apply the brakes, you might need to put on a new set of pads. What starts as squeaking will quickly turn into a grinding sound once metal makes contact with the rotors. If you need a new set of brake pads, you might spend $100 to $300 per axle for parts and labor. Having the brake rotors replaced could cost another $250 to $400 per axle. 4. Inspect TiresIf you hear squeaking, it?s always a good time to take a look at the tires. To start, you want to check all of the lug nuts and ensure they are tightened. This action doesn?t cost you any money and it ensures your on-road safety.You also want to inspect the tread of the tires. If the tread is wearing unevenly, you might need an alignment. The typical wheel alignment costs $75 to $150 per axle. However, it?s also possible that you need to get new tires installed. Expect to spend $75 to $300 per tire. 5. Lubricate SuspensionIf a squeaky suspension is causing your drive to become unbearable, you want to lubricate it. The trouble comes down to finding what are squeaking.Once you know where the squeak is, you can spray a small amount of lubricant on the part. This could be one of the most inexpensive fixes possible. "
Is It Safe to Drive a Squeaky Car?	"It depends on what are causing the problems. While you might be capable of driving the car with a squeak, it might not be wise to do so. For example, if you drive with a worn serpentine belt, you risk massive engine damage if the belt snaps.Additionally, you don?t want to drive with bad brakes. As the brake pads and rotors wear, stopping distance is increased, making it more difficult to avoid an accident. The same is true if you have bad tires on the vehicle. Handling could become an issue and the tires are more susceptible to a blow-out. In most cases, it makes sense to stop driving and figure out what the squeaking is coming from. If the problem is simply moisture or something else meaningless, you will be fine to continue driving. However, if there are any car parts that need to be replaced, it?s best to get the job done sooner than later."
Why my Car is Shaking When Driving?	"The most common reason why a car shakes when driving is due to damaged or unbalanced wheels. It can also be caused by damaged brake rotors, driveshaft issues, bad wheel bearings, or other suspension problems.As you see, there could be a lot of different potential problems causing this issue, but that is not all of them. Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of why your car is shaking while driving.1. Damaged Tires or RimsTire SwellingThe most common cause of your shaking car is damaged tires or rims. These problems can arise simply because the tires are old, or from a minor accident.Tires need to be replaced occasionally because they are made of rubber that will degrade with age and begin to crack. When the tires age and the rubber goes bad, it can cause bubbles and uneven surfaces on the tires, causing your car to shake while driving.Another common problem is that you have hit a curb or something similar and damaged the tire or the rim. If you haven?t changed your tires in a while or you know you had a minor accident with a curb, it?s definitely time to do a thorough visual inspection of your tires and wheels.2. Improper Tire BalanceWheel BalancingAnother common cause is improper tire balance. Over time, your car tires lose balance, causing vibrations. It can either be due to the age of the tires or if the balance weights come loose, especially if you have glued weights, which is common on aluminum rims.To fix this problem, take your car to a tire shop to rebalance the tires. This procedure involves adding small amounts of weight to each wheel, and it is done with the help of a tire balancing machine.3. Faulty Brake RotorsBrake Rotor DamageFaulty brake rotors are another thing that can cause vibrations and shakes while driving because the brake pads are always pushing slightly against the brake rotors.If the car vibrates more when you press the brake pedal with light force, and if you feel the steering wheel vibrate, the problem is most likely in the car?s front brake rotors. If you feel extra vibration when braking, but not from the steering wheel, it could be the rear brake rotors that are worn or damaged.The brake pads and rotors will wear out over time and need to be replaced several times during the life of the car. On average, car brake rotors should be replaced every 70,000?90,000 miles.4. Power Steering ProblemsPower Steering Fluid CheckCheck if the car vibrates or shakes only when you turn the steering wheel. If so, the problem may be with the power steering system. To correct the issue, check the power steering system for leaks and make sure the power steering fluid level is good. If the power steering fluid looks black and worn, it may be time to change it.Listen if you can hear any strange noises from the power steering pump when the car engine is running. If so, you may have a faulty power steering pump.5. CV Joint or Driveshaft IssuesDriveshaftCV joints and driveshafts transfer the power from the transmission to your wheels. These axles must be well balanced so as not to create vibrations or shakes while driving.If any of your driveshafts are bent or damaged due to hard driving or just wear and tear, the car will start shaking. The shaking intensity will increase as you accelerate the car, but you can often feel them at a constant speed as well.Just visually inspecting the axles is usually not sufficient because the differences are too small to see with your eyes. However, if they look rusty or have other damage, it may be a reason to suspect that they are out of balance.6. Damaged Steering ComponentsCar Steering E1609778849321The steering components play an important role in the drivability of your car. They must be super stable with no play; otherwise you will notice major drivability issues with your car.Over time, they will wear out, and this will create play in the bushings and ball joints. This will cause the wheel alignment to be poor, which can also create vibrations during your ride as the wheel angles fight against each other.7. Worn Wheel BearingsWorn Wheel BearingWorn wheel bearings and loose steering components are closely linked and have similar symptoms. The wheel bearings are mounted on the wheel hub and allow the wheels to rotate freely.If the wheel bearings wear out, the wheel can move freely from side to side at any speed, causing disturbing vibrations. You will also often hear a loud noise when driving at higher speeds when your car is suffering from a bad wheel bearing.8. Engine IssuesCheck Engine LightSometimes the problem isn?t the brakes or the wheels; the engine causes it. If your car starts to shake when driving at a constant speed or shakes occur during acceleration, chances are the problem is wit"
How To Fix A Car That?s Shaking While Driving?	"To fix a car that is shaking while driving, you first want to inspect the wheels and tires for any damage. Then you want to balance the tires to see if they are round and balanced. You must also inspect the brake rotors and suspension parts for any damage.Here is a more detailed list of how to fix a car that?s shaking while driving.1. Inspect and balance the tiresThe most common cause of a car shaking while driving is damage to the wheels or unbalanced wheels, and therefore it is also the first thing you want to check.Check the rims and tires for noticeable damage that can be seen with your eyes, such as tire bubbles or damage to the rims. Then you need to balance the tires and the only thing you can do is with a wheel balancer machine.Because most people don?t have a tire balancer machine at home, you most likely need to take it to a tire shop for this procedure. Balancing the wheels is often not that costly and will solve a shaking car in many cases; however, you may want to inspect the other things first also.2. Inspect the brake rotorsThe next thing you want to inspect is the brake rotors. Seeing warped brake rotors with the naked eye is in most cases impossible, but you can still inspect them to see if they are very rusty which would be a strong sign that you need to replace them.To find out if warped brake rotors are causing the shaking while driving, you need to pay attention to when the shaking occurs. If the car shakes more when you press the brake pedal, that?s a strong sign that the brake rotors are causing it.If your steering wheel shakes when you press the brake pedal, it is likely because of bad front brake rotors that need to be inspected and replaced. If the whole car shakes a lot more when you press the brake pedal, it is very likely caused by the rear brake rotors.However, if the car doesn?t shake more when you press the brake pedal than when driving normally at higher speeds, it is not very likely that it is due to bad rotors.3. Inspect the suspensionAfter you have inspected the brake rotors and wheels, you need to inspect the suspension for any damage. You must inspect all bushings, tie rods, and other parts that make up the suspension system.You need to inspect both the front and rear suspension, as both can cause a shaking car while driving. Lift the wheels up from the ground and try to pull the wheels in all directions to see if you can feel any play due to worn bushings or other suspension parts.You?ll also want to make sure the power steering fluid is full and look for any leaks around the driveshaft boots, which could be a sign of a bad CV joint.4. Talk to a professionalIf you have inspected and tried all of the above, then there is a risk that your drive shafts are out of balance or there is an engine problem. When it comes to unbalanced driveshafts, it can be very difficult to determine which driveshaft is causing it, and therefore it may be wise to get help from someone who has dealt with these problems before.We must remember that a shaking car can be really difficult to diagnose. It may be better to get help from a professional mechanic who has solved these issues many times before."
Is it OK to drive my car while shaking?	"No. It?s not recommended to drive a car while shaking until you diagnose and figure out what?s causing the issue. It could just be an unbalanced tire, which is often not that serious to drive with, but it can wear out suspension parts in the long run. You also want to be sure what are causing the problem before you continue driving the car."
Should I be worried if my car is shaking?	"If your car shakes while driving, it can both be a sign of something serious and something less serious. Therefore, you need to have someone diagnose what are causing the shaking car before continuing to drive the car to prevent further problems or even accidents."
Why does my car feel like it?s wobbling?	"If your car wobbles, it is usually due to bad suspension bushings or a bad wheel alignment. However, bad suspension bushings or other worn suspension parts will also cause bad wheel alignment, so you definitely want to check that out before getting an alignment."
Can bad spark plugs cause a car to shake?	"Yes. Bad spark plugs can cause a car to shake when accelerating or even when driving normally. However, if your car still shakes when you let off the throttle or put the car in neutral at higher speeds, it is more likely that unbalanced wheels or a bad wheel alignment are causing the problem."
what are the  Causes of Steering Wheel Shaking While Driving ?	"The most common reason a steering wheel is shaking while driving is unbalanced or damaged front wheels. It can also be due to faulty brake rotors, especially if it happens when braking. Other causes are bad wheel alignment or other bad suspension parts.Here is a more detailed list of the five most common causes of steering wheel shakes.1. Bad Front TiresDamaged TireThe most common cause of a shaking steering wheel while driving is, without a doubt, a damaged or unbalanced tire.After installing a tire on the rim ? you balance it with weights to make sure that it is perfectly balanced.These weights could come loose after a while and cause a shaking steering wheel if the front tires lost the weights.It can also be caused by damage to your tire. Inspect the front tires for any damages and if you can?t find any ? let a tire shop balance them for you.This is the most common cause for both low speeds and high speeds. If it shakes at low speed though, it is more likely damage to your tire.2. Rim or Wheel hubDamaged RimAnother widespread cause is a damaged rim if you have been in a small accident or are often driving on bumpy roads.Small damages can be repaired on the rim, but you will maybe have to replace the whole rim if it is major damage.3. Brake RotorsDamaged Brake RotorsIf your brake rotors got rusty and worn out, there is a big chance that the brake rotors are the cause of your shaking steering wheel, especially if you overheated the brake rotors at any time.This can easily be checked by slightly press the brake pedal at higher speeds ? if the problem gets worse, it is a big chance that the brake rotors are your problem.4. Wheel alignmentWheel AlignmentA faulty wheel alignment can actually cause the tires to steer in different directions and therefore starts to bump around and create a shaking steering wheel.This can especially happen if you also have other worn-out suspension parts at the same time.5. Control arm bushingsCar Control Arm E1609785652938The control arm bushings hold the tires in a fixed position to make sure they won?t start wobbling at higher speeds.This can happen especially while you are braking the car if these bushings are worn out.6. Tie rod endsTie Rod End E1609864164544The inner and outer tie rod also holds the wheel in position while driving at higher speeds. It is pretty common that these rods get worn out and will not hold the tires at a fixed position.It is not very common, but if you have tried everything else, there is a chance that you should check the tie rod ends."
what are theÿCauses of Steering wheel shakes while braking ?	"1. Front Brake RotorsThe most common cause of a shaking steering wheel while braking is, without a doubt, the front brake rotors.This is especially likely if you by any time overheated your brake rotors or if they are very rusty after standing for a long time.Unbalanced brake rotors happen to many new cars and are a rising problem on cars like BMW & Audi.2. Control arm bushingsIf you replaced the front brake rotors and the problem still exists, there is most likely a problem with your front suspension parts like the control arm bushings or a worn-out tie rod."
"To fix a shaking steering wheel, you?ll first have to determine what causes it to wobble. A damaged tire will cause this to happen even at low speeds. But if the steering wheel only shakes at highway speeds, between 50 and 70 mph, you might have a bent rim or a wheel that?s out of balance. On the other hand, a warped brake rotor will cause strong vibrations only while you?re braking. In the end, worn suspension components, such as bushings or tie rods, can make the whole steering assembly lose, so it could start vibrating at a certain point."	
How much does it cost to fix a shaking steering wheel?	"That depends on the car and what?s causing its steering wheel to shake. If one of the wheels needs to be balanced, that might set you back some $50. With prices ranging from $100 to $150, wheel alignment is a bit more expensive. Things get quite costly when replacing warped rotors and brake pads that have to go with it. You might expect to be quoted several hundred bucks for this job. And it?s not much different with replacing worn suspension components, where you also must do a wheel alignment afterward."
Is it safe to drive with a shaky steering wheel?	"Driving with a shaky steering wheel is far less safe than with one that doesn?t shake. This, in most cases, happens because of unbalanced wheels or bent rims, which cause vibrations. And contact between such wheel and the road between will definitely be reduced. Warped brake rotors are another likely cause, which can extend the braking distance, especially at high speeds. Lastly, worn-out suspension components might make the steering feel disconnected and loose, making sudden maneuvers tricky."
Will a wheel alignment fix a shaking steering wheel?	"A wheel alignment could stop the steering wheel from shaking, but only if the wheels are misaligned. This is because all wheels must point in the same direction, or they may start to shake and vibrate. Wheel misalignment will, however, usually cause increased tread wear on inner or outer tire edges. So, if you notice this and your steering wheel is shaking, maybe it?s time for a wheel alignment."
 Why my Car Makes Noise When Turning ?	"The most common causes of noises when turning are a bad coil spring, struts, or shocks. It could also be caused by a bad steering rack, tie rod ends, or worn ball joints. If you hear a growling noise when turning, it can be a bad wheel bearing.These are the most common reasons, but they aren?t all of them. I will also go through a more detailed list of the nine most common reasons your steering wheel will make noises while turning ? with a bonus tip at the end!1. Broken Steering Rack and PinionSteering RackThe largest component in your steering system is the rack and pinion. There are tons of different moving parts in it, and it?s not uncommon for it to wear out and need replacing. If your rack and pinion are wearing out, you?ll likely hear loud bangs after you turn.Furthermore, if the problem gets bad enough, you?ll likely feel it in the steering column. All you might hear for less severe problems is a slight clicking coming from underneath your vehicle when you turn.The steering rack is quite expensive to repair, so it is best to check the other components first.2. Worn Struts or ShocksStrut Replacement CostJust because these are suspension components doesn?t mean that they can?t be the cause of your noises when you turn the steering wheel.First, their mounting might be loose or worn. If that?s the case, you?ll hear it slide around as you turn. Second, you actually use your suspension as you round corners and turn the wheel. Because of this, if there?s an underlying problem, you might hear it when you turn the wheel.It is also very common that the coil springs are broken around the shocks, which will create a bad noise. It can also come from the top mount bearings at the top of the shock.3. Worn Steering Column Bearing or BootSteering ColumnIf you hear a squealing noise and it sounds like it?s coming from behind the steering wheel, it could be a worn or dry steering wheel bearing you hear. You may also notice excessive play in the steering wheel if the bearing is very bad.This can often be solved by lubricating the bearing with grease or a spray with lubricating properties. You will also find a boot whose purpose is to prevent water from entering the cabin. If this boot is dry, it can also cause a squealing noise, so it is important to lubricate this part as well.4. Loose or Damaged Tie Rod Ends/BootsTie Rod End Location E1609864283502Your rack and pinion connect to your tires with tie rod ends, and those tie rod ends have rubber boots that can wear out and tear. If that happens, you can hear your tie rod bouncing around as the metal hits the hub. You?ll need to replace the tie rod end as soon as possible, or you?ll cause additional damage.5. Worn Ball JointsBall Joint UpperBall joints work by swiveling whenever there is movement in the suspension or steering system. The two most common places you can find ball joints are on tie rod ends and control arms. If these ball joints wear out, they can start to move excessively or get stuck in a single position. Either problem will lead to excessive noises when you turn the wheel.6. Worn Control Arm BushingsCar Control Arm E1609785652938While the control arm is a part of your suspension system, that won?t keep it from making noises if some of the bushings are worn. As you turn, the control arm shifts around inside its housing, and you?ll hear the loud bangs as it moves around if the bushings are worn. If the problem gets bad enough, you?ll actually feel the entire vehicle shift as the control arms? weight slams into the side of the housing.7. Low or Old Power Steering FluidOld Power Steering FluidOne of the most straightforward problems to fix that cause noise while you?re steering is a power steering pump without enough fluid. This is a closed system, which means it shouldn?t leak. But if there is a leak, one of the first signs will be noise as you turn.However, before you just add fluid and call it good, you need to find and repair the leak.8. Damaged Power Steering PumpPower Steering PumpPower steering pumps help make turning the wheel easier as you drive, but they can get rather noisy as they start to fail. If you hear any noises coming from the top of your engine bay as you turn, there?s a good chance it?s coming from the power steering pump.9. Bad Wheel BearingWorn Wheel BearingVery worn wheel bearingIf you hear a whirring sound while driving at higher speeds and turning the steering wheel, it might be due to a bad bearing. When you turn your car, you are putting pressure on the outer wheel bearing. If you have a bad bearing, the sound will get louder as you put pressure on the bearing.

Why my Car Battery Won?t Hold A Charge?	"If your car battery won?t hold a charge, there could be a parasitic drain on the battery, or it could be old. There?s also the chance that a bad alternator, a blown fuse or corroded battery cables are the culprits.Otherwise, it may just be a low-quality battery, or you may not be taking long enough drives to charge the battery. A quick look at each of the reasons may help you figure out what?s going on with your battery. 1. Parasitic DrainHonda RadioThe radio is a common issue when it comes to parasitic drainMany features run on the car battery. If these elements are drawing power when they shouldn?t be, the battery may become drained.You may not think that a trunk light, computer module or a faulty relay could cause the battery to become depleted, but it does. If your battery keeps dying despite charging it, you want to hunt down a possible parasitic drain. 2. Bad BatteryBad Car BatteryCar batteries have a limited lifespan. Typically, you can expect a battery to last three to five years. If it has become too old, it may no longer charge or respond to being jump-started. The only solution will be to replace it. 3. Bad AlternatorAlternator LocationIf you?ve replaced the car battery and still can?t get it to hold a charge, looking at the alternator would be next. The alternator is responsible for charging the car battery while the engine is running. If you are able to jump-start the battery, but it fails after a few minutes of running, it?s because the alternator can?t charge it. Typically, the alternator will last 80,000 miles or more. 4. Blown FuseYour car probably has two fuse boxes. One is found under the steering wheel near the floor. The other is typically located under the hood.These boxes contain fuses that prevent electric overload of all the features. If the alternator fuse blows, it won?t be able to charge the car battery anymore. 5. Low-Quality BatteryIt can be difficult to swallow the cost of a new car battery. It seems the prices just keep getting higher and higher. However, there are multiple reasons why you don?t want to skimp on the quality of the car battery just to save a little money.For one reason, a low-quality battery is going to fail sooner than something from a reliable brand. If you can?t get the battery to charge, it could be due to the quality you?ve chosen. 6. Only Driving Short TripsRemember how we discussed that the alternator is responsible for charging the battery while you drive? For the alternator to fully charge the battery, you need to drive a fair distance. It also helps if you are traveling at highway speeds.If you only take the car out to head a mile into town and back, the battery is going to eventually die. Try and take a longer drive, even just for the scenery. 6. Corroded Battery CablesCorroded Battery TerminalLet?s say the battery isn?t old and there?s nothing wrong with the alternator, but it still won?t charge the battery. It?s possible that corrosion has occurred on the terminals or cable connectors. Battery corrosion occurs because the sulfuric acid releases hydrogen gas. When this comes in contact with the air, a chemical reaction occurs, leading to corrosion. This corrosion gets in the way of a proper connection, so charging can?t take place. "
how To Fix my Car Battery That Won't Hold A Charge?	"Most of the problems we?ve discussed are easy to diagnose and repair, even if you aren?t a professional like we are. You shouldn?t need any fancy tools and minor mechanical expertise is required. 1. Test BatteryTest Car BatteryIf the battery doesn?t hold a charge, your first step is to test the battery. Many auto parts stores offer free battery testing and they will put a new battery in for you if it?s purchased at the store. If you want to test your own battery, here are the steps.Remove the surface charge. Turn on the high-beam headlights for one minute with the engine off.Set your multimeter to read direct current (DC) voltage.Set the dial to 20 volts.Connect the leads, red to positive and black to negative. If the multimeter reads a negative number, the leads are backward.A healthy car battery should read 12.6 volts or higher. If it?s reading lower, hook it up to a charger and test it again. If it continues to fail, the battery may need to be replaced. 2. Check Charging SystemYou can also have the alternator checked at many auto parts stores. If you want to do it yourself, here are the steps.Set the multimeter to 20 DCV.Connect the black and red cables to the battery terminals.With the car engine running, the reading should be higher than the battery reading. Look for a measurement of 13.5 to 14.5 volts. This higher reading ensures the battery gets what it needs to charge. 3. Diagnose Parasitic DrainIf the battery and alternator are in good condition, but the car keeps dying, there could be something draining the battery. Finding a parasitic drain isn?t easy to do.Remove the negative battery cable. Connect the multimeter. The black lead goes to the negative battery cable and the red connects to the negative battery post.Set the multimeter to 20A.Remove fuses one at a time while someone watches the multimeter.Once you see the reading on the multimeter drop, you?ve found the parasitic drain. Reference your owner?s manual to find out what that fuse belongs to and fix the fault. 4. Check FusesFind the fuse or fuses that relate to the charging system and check to see if they are blown. When a fuse blows, the wire inside has a gap in it.To get the charging system working again, you need to replace this fuse. Just make sure you put a new one in that?s rated for the same amperage. 5. Drive Longer TripsIf your lifestyle is preventing the battery from getting charged, you need to make some changes. Instead of taking multiple smaller trips throughout the week, consider combining them into one larger drive.If you can?t drive enough to keep the battery at full capacity, it?s best to hook it up to a battery charger. You can place a trickle charger or a maintainer on the battery to ensure it?s always ready to go. 6. Contact A ProfessionalThe battery and alternator are sophisticated pieces of equipment that aren?t meant to be worked on if you don?t understand the basics. If you are unsure what to do or this problem has you stumped, go ahead and contact a professional. Don?t forget that you also have the option to have these components checked at a local auto parts store. At least you can rule out the battery and alternator for no extra charge before calling a mechanic. "
Can I fix a battery that won?t hold a charge?	"You may be able to recondition it if there?s still some life left. Mix Epsom salts and distilled water together. Pour it into the battery through the caps that open. If your battery doesn?t have these caps, it?s a sealed unit. The mixture will remove the sulfate buildup, often giving you a little more time. "
How do I know if it?s the alternator or the battery?	"Jump-start the car to see what happens. If the alternator is working correctly, the car will start but die again shortly after because the alternator isn?t charging the battery. On the other hand, if you can?t get the car started at all, the battery might be the problem. "
Why does my car battery lose charge so quickly?	"As the battery becomes older, it won?t hold a charge as easily. Additionally, if there?s any corrosion on the battery terminals, the alternator won?t be able to supply enough power to charge the battery. There could also be a parasitic drain that?s robbing the battery of its power. "
Can an alternator drain a battery when the car is off?	"While it?s very rare, it?s technically possible for a defective alternator to malfunction and drain the battery while the engine is turned off. If the circuit to the alternator remains on for some reason, battery juice could be zapped. It?s much more common that you are dealing with some other form of a parasitic drain. "
What Causes Melting or Smoking Jumper Cables?	"In some cases, the jumper cables will melt because of a poor connection. Other times, the smoking and melting of the jumper cables is caused by a failure, whether they are too thin, broken or you spent too much time trying to crank with them installed. 1. Incorrectly ConnectedJumper Cables ConnectedWhen there is a user error with the connection, it will not only cause the jumper cables to melt, but it can also lead to an inability to jump the vehicle. When you connect the cables, you must make sure that the clamps are put on in the right order and to the appropriate location. Each one of the clamps is meant for a particular terminal on the car battery. Red clamps go with the positive posts, while the black clamps are meant to connect with a negative post. If you reversed this order, electrical failure might occur, leading to melting and smoking. While it doesn?t seem like a good thing to have the cables melt, this is actually a built-in safety feature. Instead of exploding the battery, the cables melt instead. It?s much easier to replace a set of jumper cables than to fix a car after a battery has exploded. 2. Jumper Cables Too ThinThe jumper cable is needed to transfer power from the good charging system to the one that has failed. Electricity is produced from this transfer, which is why you must be careful what type of jumper cables you purchase. Jumper cables can be bought in a variety of gauges, indicating how thin or thick they are.If you choose to save money by buying something too thin for the power that?s being transferred, you can melt the cables. The cables will overheat until the plastic melts. The only way to prevent this is to ensure you only use cables that are rated for your particular vehicle or better. 3. Bad ConnectionCar Battery Terminal CorrosionWe?ve already discussed how a poorly aligned connection between the two vehicles can cause issues, but we must also look at how the cables are connected to each car individually. For batteries to be charged, all of the connections must be perfect. If there is corrosion on the battery post, you can run into many of the same problems because the connection will be loose. Bad connections lead to a loss of electricity. So, along with heating up the wires and causing melting, you may also have trouble getting the battery jumped. 4. Damaged CablesJumper cables are built to be durable. After all, they have a heavy-duty job to perform. Still, they will go bad and fail over years of use, especially if they haven?t been stored correctly. Any spill can lead to damage or corrosion of the clamps. The plastic insulators can also fall apart from getting too brittle. Either way, any damage to the jumper cables can cause malfunctions, including melting or smoking. 5. Cranked Too LongRemember how we talked about all of that electricity working through the jumper cables? If you try to crank the engine for too long, there?s going to be an excessive amount of electricity that the cables may not be able to take.For this reason, it?s possible to melt cables if you keep cranking the engine when you shouldn?t. This problem is more likely if you are using a cheap pair of jumper cables, as heavy-duty options are better insulated and prepared for the power. "
How To Fix Melting Or Smoking Jumper Cables ?	"The only way to fix a smoking or melting jumper cable is to first figure out what went wrong. Once you know where the error is, you can choose one of these repair methods to fix the problem.1. Connect Cables CorrectlyConnect Jumper CablesThe only way to properly get a car jumped is to connect the cables to each car correctly. Here?s the recommended way that most technicians use.Connect a red (positive) jumper cable to the dead battery?s positive terminal. These can be marked with a plus sign.Connect the second red (positive) jumper cable to the good battery?s positive terminal. These can be marked with a plus sign. Attach a black (negative) jumper cable to the dead battery?s negative terminal. This can be marked with a minus sign.Attach the second black (negative) jumper cable to the good battery?s negative terminal. This can be marked with a minus sign.If you don?t do it in this order, not only can the cables melt, but an explosion could occur. That?s why you should always follow the outlined procedure and never let the ends of the cables touch one another. 2. Check Connection If you are positive that the connections are aligned correctly, it?s time to check each car?s posts. Look at the terminals to ensure there?s no corrosion. You want a nice, snug fit on both sides.If corrosion is present, you can gently wipe it off and try to reattach the cables. You should also verify that the terminals are tight when you are finished jumping the battery. 3. Use Thicker Jumper CablesTo the untrained eye, all jumper cables appear to be the same. However, jumper cables are available in a variety of sizes, with cheap cables having a much thinner material.To prevent melting the cables, we recommend upgrading to a better set. It doesn?t cost much more for the upgrade and you will save yourself a lot of headaches. Plus, you will be able to jump bigger cars with the well-insulated cables. 4. Let Them Cool DownIf you are having trouble getting a car jumped, take a break. Don?t keep cranking the engine trying to get it to turn over.Instead, you want to give it a shot for a minute and stop. If it doesn?t work at first, let the cables sit in place and cool down before trying again. "
How To Choose The Correct Size Of Jumper Cables?	"There are two specific aspects of the jumper cables that are most important. To start, you must pay attention to the rating, which is considered a size. The rating shows you the wiring gauge beneath the insulation. The lower this number is, the thicker the cable is. If you want the best jumper cables, you need something that?s heavy-duty with a lower number. Ideally, the 1- and 2-gauge cables are going to provide the most consistent results, no matter what car you work with. On the other hand, a 9- or 10-gauge cable is only meant for compact cars. Aside from the rating, you must also think about length, although this won?t cause the cables to melt. Still, if the jumper cables aren?t long enough, you won?t be able to reach both cars. In most cases, ten feet might be long enough, but why take chances? It doesn?t cost that much more to get a set of 25-foot cables and you have more guarantees when emergencies arise. "
What Does It Mean When Jumper Cables Start Smoking?	"If the cables are smoking or melting, a connection could be bad or the cables could be damaged. It?s also possible that you are trying to crank the engine for too long and the cables are starting to overheat. Recheck your connections and the cables to determine the cause, so it can be repaired. "
How Do You Know When Jumper Cables Are Bad?	"While jumper cables aren?t going to go bad, they can deteriorate and fail to work properly. Typically, you will see exposed wires under the insulation. There could also be corrosion of the clamps or fraying of the cables. If any damage is spotted, you should replace the cables immediately. "
Can You Still Use Melted Jumper Cables?	"You should never use jumper cables that are melted or have other defects. If you do, there?s a higher chance of an electrical short or fire. Not only can you cause a lot of damage to your vehicle, but there?s a higher risk of personal injury as well. "
Is It Bad If Jumper Cables Spark?	"If you connect the negative terminal before the positive, you may deal with some sparking. This is a dangerous situation and can lead to injury and damage. For that reason, it?s important that you connect the jumper cables in the proper order to protect yourself and your vehicle. "
How Long Should You Let A Car Sit With Jumper Cables?	"It depends on the type of car you are jumping and how dead the battery is. In some cases, you can connect the two and crank the engine on the first try. Other times, it could take five minutes of waiting before a proper charge is applied. In heavy-duty situations, vehicles may need to sit for up to thirty minutes before they can be started, especially if you are using cheap jumper cables. "
Odyssey vs. Optima Batteries: Differences & Which Is Better?	"If you have a tight budget, you may prefer the Optima battery because of the slightly lower cost, yet you aren't sacrificing a lot of power or features. However, Odyssey batteries may last slightly longer and tend to have a better CCA rating, but for an additional cost.With either brand, you will be able to find batteries that fit many applications. You also don't have to worry about maintenance other than keeping the battery charged.Determining which one is best for you requires you to look at your needs. Do you want to save money today and replace the battery more often, or would you rather pay a little more now for a longer service life?OdysseyOddsey batteriesOdyssey batteries are produced by EnerSys Energy Products Inc. In total, the company has acquired more than ten other manufacturers over the years, providing it a leader to contend with. Its headquarters is located in Reading, Pennsylvania and the company has been in business since 1999. Odyssey batteries are produced in 17 countries, making them a widespread option.Over the years, Odyssey batteries have become synonymous with a long service life and high-quality power production. The company provides a two-year replacement warranty, but it's unlikely that you'll ever need to use it.Odyssey ProsThere are many things that the Odyssey brand does right. Here are a few of the advantages to consider.Long service lifeMaintenance-free optionsWide temperature rangeGood reserve capacity ratingVibration resistantGood warranty coverageOdyssey ConsWith all that Odyssey does right, it's easy to overlook a couple of faults. Here are some to consider.Costs slightly moreDifficult to jump startHard to restoreOptimaOptima BatteryOptima batteries are part of Clarios, which is owned by Johnson Controls. The company hasn't been around as long as Odyssey but has been in business since 1972. Currently, the batteries are produced in a plant in Mexico, but there are more than sixty locations worldwide where the business operates.Many of the top automakers and retailers use Optima batteries, including BMW, Toyota, Sears and Walmart. With a wide variety of batteries to choose from, it's easy to get one for a vehicle, RV, marine applications and more.Optima ProsThere are so many things that the Optima brand does right. Here are just a few.Good price/performance ratioReliable powerNo maintenanceGood warranty coverageWide availabilityOptima ConsWith so many pros to look at, don't forget to evaluate the few shortcomings of these batteries.Shorter lifespanTakes time to chargeSmaller temperature rangeKey Differences Between Odyssey And Optima BatteriesThere are many aspects between the Odyssey and Optimal lineup of batteries that are similar. Instead of focusing on what both brands do, let's look at where there could be some differences. We take a closer look at the prices, customer service, technology and the cold cranking amps (CCA) rating.1. PricesComparing batteries between the two brands head-to-head, you see that Optima is usually slightly cheaper. On average, you may spend $250 for a high-quality Optima battery, while Odyssey models can cost $300 or more.Determining the value of something is far different from the price. If you want to look at the per-mile cost of both batteries, you may find that the Odyssey usually beats the Optima. Basically, you may be able to get far more miles for the higher price of the Odyssey battery, giving you a better overall value. However, you have to pay more up front to take advantage of the longer service life.2. Customer ServiceCustomer ServiceWhile you are paying more for the Odyssey battery, you may be disappointed in the next category. Many Odyssey batteries have a two-year replacement warranty (although some offer more). In comparison, most Optima batteries come with a three-year replacement warranty.Optima has also been known for better customer service. When a warranty claim occurs, Optima is quick to send out a new battery without a lot of hassle. Odyssey isn't as quick to turn over new batteries to customers, without a lot of investigation.With this in mind, the difference could come down to trust in the product. Odyssey might be less willing to send out new batteries because the company knows its product is good. Optima might be handing out batteries like candy because it knows they don't always last.3. TechnologyBoth battery brands produce AGM batteries. An AGM (absorbed glass mat) battery has a special glass mat separator wicking the electrolyte solution in between the battery plates. AGM batteries deliver larger bursts of energy and run for a longer amount of time. Aside from being AGM batteries, these two brands do offer something a little different from one another.Optima uses Spiral Gem technology, which is effective but also takes up more space than what's needed. In comparison, the Odyssey batteries have a Thin Plate Pure Lead technology"
Are Optima batteries better?	"Optima batteries are usually slightly cheaper than Odyssey batteries but may not last as long. However, the brand still makes an exceptional battery lineup available for a variety of purposes. You can find a new battery for your car, truck, recreational vehicle, boat and more at a fraction of the cost."
Are ODYSSEY batteries good?	"Odyssey batteries are considered some of the best because of the Thin Plate Pure Technology. These batteries last a long time and are maintenance-free. Plus, Odyssey offers a decent warranty length and has a variety of batteries for many different applications, but you will pay more than you might expect."
How many years will an OPTIMA battery last?	"On average, you can expect to see four years or more out of an Optima battery. However, the battery life depends heavily on how you treat it. If you spend a lot of time taking shorter trips and not letting the battery get fully charged, it may not last as long. Your environment plays a role in the life too. "
How long will an Odyssey battery last?	"Expect an Odyssey battery to last anywhere from three to eight years, depending on how it is taken care of. Many of the batteries have either a two- or three-year replacement warranty, so you don?t have to worry about premature failure. "
How to Disconnect a Car Battery Safely?	"Disconnecting a car battery can seem like a simple task. Unfortunately, you can actually damage your car's electronics if you do it the wrong way. Here's how to do it properlyBattery CarThe car battery may be one of the most important components of the car as any problem with the battery might leave you stranded on the road.The car battery has two main functions; it helps to start the car when you switch on the ignition and the other function is providing power to electrical systems in the car such as the stereo, lights, radio etc.Since you cannot start your car with a faulty battery, it is highly important to keep it maintained properly.The car battery terminals get corroded over time due to the hydrogen gas that is released from the acid in the battery. In such a case, you?ll be required to remove the battery and clean it thoroughly.There are many other reasons why you would be required to disconnect the car battery, either for maintenance or service. Either way, it is recommended that you know the correct procedure. In this guide, we will discuss how you can correctly disconnect the car battery in a safe way.Table Of Contents  show Safety tips before disconnecting the batteryHere are some important safety tips you need to keep in mind before disconnecting the car battery.Batteries store electric charge and might give you a small shock if not handled properly. Before disconnecting the battery, make sure you are not wearing any jewelry such as a ring, watch, or a bracelet. If the battery comes in contact with any metal part it can cause an electric shock.Always carry out the battery removal procedure in an outdoor space as the batteries contain acids which release harmful gasses. Working in an open environment will minimize your exposure to any hazardous gas.Make sure the area where you are working is completely dry and covered. Never work in an environment which is damp or has water nearby.By removing the battery terminals, your settings in the clock or radio may get reset and you also may have to enter the radio code. If you do not have the radio code you may have to go to a dealership for them to unlock the code. You can add a small amount of power to the system while replacing the battery but is only recommended if you are a skilled mechanic because working with the electrics connected can be dangerous and you can damage electronics."
How to disconnect a car battery ?	"There are some easy steps you should take to disconnect your car battery from your car. Here are 7 steps to disconnect your car battery in a safe way:1. Switch off the ignition & use safety equipmentIgnitionBefore you begin to disconnect the battery, ensure that the ignition is turned off and remove the key. Also leave the driver?s door open, because it can happen that the car will lock while replacing the battery. If you have an automatic, check if the car is in ?Park? position or it should be in the first gear in the case that the car has a manual transmission. Since the car battery holds an electric charge and is capable of releasing flammable gas as well, it is strongly recommended to put on some safety gloves and goggles.2. Open the hoodBattery ReplacementOnce the ignition has been turned off, open the hood by pulling the hood lever or pressing the button which is usually located somewhere below and near the steering wheel. Refer to your car owner?s manual if you can?t find the hood lever.Some cars have the battery located in the trunk and if so, open your trunk. You can find information about this in your owner?s manual.3. Locate the batteryCar Battery RotatedIf your car battery is located under the hood, go towards the front of your car and open the hood. Use the rod to keep the hood standing in its place and then look for the battery?s negative terminal. The terminal may have a black cover on top of it and will have a negative (-) sign indicating that it is the negative terminal.Locate your car battery with the help of the owner?s manual. Sometimes it?s located in the trunk or under a seat.4. Disconnect the negative terminal of the batteryMinus TerminalYou should always remove the negative battery terminal first, to reduce the risk of sparks which can make the car battery explode.Once the negative terminal has been located, use the wrench to loosen the nut that holds the terminal. Once it is loosened, you can use your hand to remove the nut but make sure you have the safety gloves on.You might face some difficulty in finding the right size socket wrench but once you do, gently turn the screw in a counterclockwise direction until it becomes loose. Make sure to keep the nut in a safe place.5. Disconnect the positive terminal of the batteryPlus TerminalAfter you have removed the negative terminal, follow the same steps for the positive terminal. Do not let the positive terminal come into contact with any metal part on the car as there is some charge left in the system and in case of contact, the car?s electrical circuit can get disturbed.6. Locate and remove battery bracket or strapCar Battery BracketUsually, car batteries are held at its place by a metal bracket or something similar. To remove the battery you do often have to remove this bracket or strap. If your car is equipped with a bracket you will often find it holding the battery at the bottom of the car battery.7. Remove & Install the new battery in the same way as you removed it.Disconnect A Car BatteryOnce the battery has been disconnected completely, gently lift it up from the tray and carry it with utmost care. You have now completely disconnected and removed the car battery. Batteries are usually heavy, especially if you drive a truck or an SUV which has a battery weighing almost 40 pounds.To install the new battery you can use the same guide but backward. Put the battery in place and fit the bracket or strap. Start with installing the positive terminal and the negative terminal after. Remember that you often have to re-set the clock and radio settings in your car after you replaced you battery.Cleaning the battery terminalsIf you have disconnected your car battery after a long time, you might have noticed that the terminals have corrosion on them. The good news is that you don?t need any expensive cleaner to clean the corrosion as you can easily do it with stuff at your home. The things you would require are:? Gloves? Petroleum jelly? Baking soda? Water? Toothbrush? Cleaning clothMaking the cleaner is simple; just mix one tablespoon of baking soda in one cup of water and mix it well. Next, dip the toothbrush into the cleaner and start cleaning the terminals. You might need to apply some force as the dust and grime may be difficult to remove.Scrub the terminals thoroughly until no dust or grime is visible. Once the corrosion is removed, spray water on the terminals and wipe gently with a clean cloth or rag. Once the terminals have been cleaned and dried, apply petroleum jelly on them which will provide some lubrication and prevent any further corrosion.Note: Before you begin cleaning the terminals, inspect the car battery to see if it is leaking, swollen or has any visible damage. If the battery is damaged then cleaning the terminals will be no good and you would still have to purchase a new battery.If it?s leaking you can find some recommended batteries for"
How to Recondition Your Car Battery ?	"Make sure your car does not have an AGM or GEL battery before you begin with these steps. These batteries contain a gel instead of liquid which means they are maintenance-free.However, if you have refill caps on the top of your battery and if you are sure that you do not have an AGM or GEL battery, you can follow these steps to recondition your car battery:STEP 1: Test the BatteryLow Battery VoltageYou can?t recondition just any battery. First, you need to test it to make sure it will respond properly to the reconditioning process.The battery should read at least 12 volts. If your reading shows 10 to 12 volts instead, you may be able to restore the normal function through reconditioning. However, there?s no reason to try it once the battery reaches below 10 volts if you recharged it quite recently. At this point, you are better off getting a replacement. You can also test the car battery with a car battery tester for more accurate results.STEP 2: Prepare Electrolyte SolutionEpsom SaltYou will be replacing the electrolyte solution inside the battery. Before you move further, it?s helpful to have that solution prepared so it is ready to go.Heat up half a quart of distilled water. Make sure it reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit. In that hot water, you want to dissolve seven to eight ounces of Epsom salts. Set your solution aside.STEP 3: Remove Battery Cell CapsRemove Battery Cap E1619975436418Take off the battery cell caps for quick access to the battery. Make sure you are wearing protective gear, such as gloves and goggles. You don?t want to get any battery acid on you. If you use a sealed battery type, you will need to locate the shadow plugs instead. These cover the openings of the battery cells and require you to drill through them carefully. (Make sure you do not have an AGM or GEL battery and check the car battery manufacturer?s instructions).STEP 4: Replace Battery SolutionFill Car BatteryNow, you want to drain the existing fluid out of the battery. To do this, you will need a container to pour the solution in. Make sure you dispose of this property. Once the battery is drained, you are ready to fill it back up with your Epsom salt and water solution. Use a small plastic funnel and fill each cell completely. STEP 5: Charge the BatteryCar Battery ChargerInstall the battery caps again you took off or insert plastic plugs into the drill holes you needed to make. Gently, you can shake the battery to ensure all of the solution is equally distributed. Charge your battery with a slow charger. It?s best to have it charging for at least 24 hours before testing it and reinstalling it in your vehicle. "
what are Battery Reconditioning?	"The battery supplies energy to your vehicle, mainly to start the engine. However, the battery also powers up all of the electronics and devices. While you drive, the battery is recharged with the alternator. As it discharges regularly, sulfation happens. Sulfation is a chemical reaction that causes sulfate crystals to build up on the plates of the battery. The more crystals that are present, the longer charging times the battery requires and the less efficient it becomes. By reconditioning the battery, you refurbish it and remove those sulfates. You also replenish the electrolyte solution inside the battery, which allows it to recharge faster and function like it is new. "
Benefits of Car Battery Reconditioning ?	"There are two options available to you when your battery stops working as it should. First, you can buy a new one. Or, you can choose to recondition it. If there?s no damage to the battery, reconditioning is usually a good option. You can expect several advantages from automotive battery reconditioning. Most importantly, you can extend the life of the battery.If most car batteries last about five years, you might think that the normal course of action would be to replace the battery once it gets old and inefficient. Instead of replacing it, you attempt reconditioning instead. This might extend the battery life by a year or two, meaning you used your battery for seven years instead. This extra time ensures you get your money?s worth out of the battery. Obviously, this leads right into the next benefit of a reconditioned battery ? the cost savings. You can save a good chunk of change over buying a new battery, considering an average replacement battery will cost around $75. A final benefit is the reduction of waste. Instead of getting rid of the battery and the chemicals inside, you utilize a way to recycle it. You might also get good enough at this process to start a business and make a little money on the side. "
Battery Reconditioning Cost	"The cost to recondition car batteries is minimal. You don?t need a lot of supplies, other than your protective gear, distilled water and Epsom salts. These supplies should cost you less than $20, which is much lower than what you would spend replacing the car battery. If you can get another year or two out of the batteries, then it would be considered a great investment."
How to Check your Car Battery Health?	"There are a few different ways you can use to test your car battery health. Here are 8 of the best methods to get a correct diagnosis of your car battery:1. Check the voltageVoltmeterThe voltmeter is the device used to measure voltage in devices. Voltmeters can be either analog or digital; the choice of one depends on your personal preferences and budget. The first thing to do when using the voltmeter is to turn off any car accessories that could drain power from the battery. This includes turning off the ignition, car radio, and headlights.Next, remove the covers on the battery terminals. Connect the positive point of the voltmeter to the red battery terminal, while the negative point should be connected to the black battery terminal. Check the readings; a good battery should indicate a voltage between 12.4 V and 12.7 V.A reading above 12.5 V is an indication of a good battery, while a 12.3 V charge means that your battery is 75% charged. Anything below 11.8 volts means your battery is low in charge and working at 25%. Using a voltmeter is not the best method for getting an accurate result though ? you need to test the battery under load.2. Headlights testHeadlight TestIf you do not have a voltmeter, you can check how the car?s headlights react when you turn the car up. If you turn the headlights on and find that they are darker than usual, your car battery may be low. If you turn the car up and the headlights get brighter, it means that your alternator is working but does not supply enough current to fully charge the battery.If you don?t notice any change in the brightness of the headlights when you turn the car up, the battery is working properly.3. Battery health indicatorCar Battery Health IndicatorThis is a new component that has been added to modern cars. The indicator is a cover attached to the battery, and when you turn on the ignition, an arrow moves to either red or green. When the voltage of your battery is low, it turns red, when it is in good condition, it turns green. When your battery is empty and no longer in use, you will see a black color.4. Load testCar Battery TesterFor this test you need a car battery tester. Test your battery with a CCA rating of one and a half and observe if the battery holds 9.6 volts for 15 seconds. When performing the test, make sure the battery is fully charged.5. Power probePower ProbeIf you do not have a voltmeter, you can check a car battery with a performance certificate. The power measurement probe has a tip, which you tap on the positive battery pole and the negative pole on the -ve of the power measurement probe. A good battery should have a reading between 12.2 and 12.9 volts.Make sure that you have turned off the ignition and that all accessories that use the battery are turned off. This is not the best way to measure, since it is much better to test under load.6. AmmeterAmmeterThe ammeter is used to check the incoming and outgoing charge of the battery. The ammeter tells you whether your battery is fully charged by the alternator. If the incoming charge is full, your battery is OK.7. Hydrometer checkHydrometerThe hydrometer is used to check the degree of acidity in the battery plates. If the acid is weak, the battery is working properly. For best results, buy a hydrometer with a thermometer. You will find some models that adjust themselves, while some come with a conversion table.Battery acid is dangerous, and you must wear gloves when working with acid. Also, do not use a metal thermometer for the electrolyte temperature because of reactions with the acid.To begin, open the plate covers on the top of the battery. Drop your hydrometer into the first cell and press the hydrometer cover together. As soon as you release the lid, the electrolyte flows into the hydrometer.Make a note of the measured value for the specific gravity of the electrolyte. Repeat the test with the other cells.A functioning battery will have a reading between 1.265 and 1.299, while a reading below this indicates an undercharged battery. Larger discrepancies in the measured values indicate that the battery is sulfated.8. Physical inspection of the batteryCar Battery CheckA physical examination of the car battery is essential to detect any cracks. To do this, you must first disconnect the battery terminals and then remove the battery from the car. Place the battery on a flat surface and check that no bulge has formed on the surface of the battery. Doming of the battery is the result of overcharging. Next, inspect the battery terminals and look at the insulation. If the battery has cracks, you must replace it.Before you put the battery back in the battery carrier, you must clean it. Cleaning the battery is easy. All you need is some baking soda, water, and a soft brush. Pour the ingredients into a container and wash the top and side of the battery with a soft brush. Wipe off excess liquid with a dry cloth. Rep"
what are the  Causes of a Dead Car Battery ?	"The most common cause of a dead car battery is that you forgot any electric consumer on. It can also be due to a faulty electric consumer which won?t shut off when you remove the key from the ignition. It can also be caused by cold weather.Here is a more detailed list of what could cause a dead car battery.1. You forgot any electric consumers onCar Light Switch OnOne of the reasons for an empty battery is human error. There are moments when you are in a hurry and forget to turn off the lights or close a door properly before leaving the vehicle. If the headlights stay overnight or for a few hours, they drain the battery, and your car battery will be dead in the morning.However, modern cars have warning signals when you leave the headlights on, such as a beeping sound, but it can definitely be missed if you were in a hurry.2. Electric consumers are drawing powerCar Stereo OnDid you recently install some external electronics to your car, like a car stereo or a GPS? Then there is a chance that you wired these devices wrong, which will cause them to stay on even after you turn the ignition off.It can also be caused by any faulty consumers who are not shutting off when you switch off the ignition. However, this can be difficult to diagnose, and you might want to let an expert looking at it with the right equipment.3. The alternator is going badAlternator LocationThe alternator?s job is always to charge the car battery while you are driving. If the alternator is starting to go bad, it may not charge the car battery properly, and within time, this can cause the car battery to drain out.You can check the alternator by measuring the car battery voltage on idle. You should get over 14 volts if your alternator is in good shape.4. Cold weather and a low charged car batteryCold Weather CarWas your car standing outside while it was freezing weather? Car batteries can actually freeze if the weather is very cold. This especially happens if your car battery is not fully charged and especially if it is empty.The cold may actually have killed your car battery, and in this case, you have to replace it.5. You only drive short distancesDrive Car 2Many people do not use their car a lot. This causes your car to only being driven for short distances. As you might know by now, the alternator is always charging your car battery while driving.If you only drive short distances, the car will draw more power than the alternator will have time to produce, and this can cause the car battery to drain out and die completely.6. Lack of car battery maintenanceFill Car BatteryCar batteries actually need maintenance to have a long life. This includes cleaning the terminals, filling with battery water (if the battery has this refilling holes), and maintaining recharge your car battery quite often.If you never did any maintenance to your car battery, it could absolutely be the cause of your dead car battery.7. Car Battery went badBad Car BatteryIt happens that your car just went bad because of age. A car battery has an average lifetime of around 5 years, and if it hasn?t been changed within this timeframe ? there is absolutely a chance that your car battery is just old and needs to be replaced.You can often check your car battery?s condition with a car battery analyzer.8. Corroded or Loose Battery CablesCorrosion Battery TerminalIt can actually happen that your car battery is, in fact, not bad at all; it is just a bad connection between the car battery terminals and the battery cables.This is often caused by corrosion on the terminals and can easily be cleaned with acid."
What to do when you car battery is dead?	"If your car battery is dead, the best way is to charge it again with a car battery charger. If you do not have one available and are in a hurry, you can jump-start it with another car. You can also use a jump starter if you have one available.There are some different ways you can handle the situation with your dead car battery, depending on how in a hurry you are and what tools you have access to. Here?s a more detailed list of what to do if your car battery is dead:1. Jump-Start from Another CarJump Starting CarWhen your car battery is dead in emergencies, the best thing to do is jump-starting it from another car?s battery.The only thing you need to jump-start is another car with a working car battery and a pair of jumper cables. If you do not have a pair of them in your car, I strongly recommend getting a pair.The jump-starting is pretty straightforward, but you have to follow it closely not to cause any shorts, which may damage the cars.Put both cars in park or neutral with the handbrake. Open the hoods of both cars and locate the car batteries. Remember that some cars can have their car battery located in the trunk.Attach the red jumper cable to the positive (+) terminal of your car battery and the other end to the other car?s positive (+) terminal.Attach the black jumper cable to the negative (-) terminal to the other car?s battery first. Then you can connect the other end of the cable to a metal-clean surface on your car?s body or at the engine. You can also attach it to the negative (-) terminal of your car battery if you can?t find any other place, but it is not recommended.Start your car and let it run for a minute.Begin with removing the negative jumper cable from any of the cars.Next time, I recommend you get a jump starter to keep in your glove box, which will make the situation much easier the next time.2. Recharge the car batteryCharge Car BatteryIf your car is parked at home and not in a hurry, it can be a good idea to charge your car battery slowly. Slower chargings are much better for the car battery than jump-starting it.3. Replace the car batteryCar Battery CheckCar batteries should usually be replaced every 5 years. If you feel that the car battery is very old, it may be a good time to replace the car battery instead of recharging it, which may cause the same situation again shortly.4. Diagnose what are drawing power.Best Car Battery TestersAfter you have started your car, you have to find out what caused the car battery to die suddenly, or otherwise, you may end up in the same situation again.Below, you will find more information about what can cause the car battery to die suddenly."
What Causes Battery Terminal Corrosion?	"The most common reason for battery terminal corrosion is hydrogen or electrolyte leakage from the battery. It can also be caused by an alternator slightly overcharging the car battery over a long period of time. Chemical reactions with copper clamps are not rare, either.These are a few different reasons why you may notice corrosion on your battery terminals. Here is a more detailed list of the 5 most common causes of battery terminal corrosion.1. Hydrogen gas leakageLeaking Car BatteryThe battery turns acid into an electric current. Sometimes, the hydrogen gas in the battery leaks and finds its way into the atmosphere. It reacts with other substances, and battery terminal corrosion is the result.Different problems relating to the battery will show up depending on which side of the battery corrosion has formed on. If it is on the negative terminal, this is a sign of undercharging. If it is on the positive terminal, it is due to overcharging.2. Electrolyte leakageThis problem is synonymous with lead-acid batteries. Due to age or damage, the battery?s electrolyte can leak and accumulate on the battery terminals. The probability of the electrolyte leaking is increased if you overfill the battery water.3. Chemical Reaction In The Copper ClampsCopper is a good conductor and does not corrode easily. However, when electric currents pass through the copper terminals, copper sulfate is produced, and this leads to battery terminal corrosion.A bluish precipitate on the copper terminals can signify copper sulfate. Copper sulfate does not conduct electricity well, and you will start experiencing trouble starting your car as a result.4. OverchargingIf your alternator is slightly overcharging your car battery, it might cause corrosion on your car battery terminals. Check your voltage with a multimeter when your car runs to make sure it is not charging over 14.5 volts when you are revving the engine.It can also be because you are frequently charging your car battery too hard with a car battery charger.5. Overfilling the batteryRefill Car BatteryIf you overfill your car battery, it might cause the electrolyte to leak out, as mentioned before. Not all car batteries are refillable, but you should absolutely double-check if you have one so it is not overfilled."
How to Fix battery terminal corrosion?	"Now, that we know what causes car battery corrosion, we need to know how to fix it. There are some different methods you can use to clean the battery terminals.1. Baking soda ? water solutionIf you want to remove copper sulfate from the terminals, you will need a solution of baking soda and water, and a brush. First, ensure that the car?s ignition has been turned off. Remove the battery terminals and use your brush to remove some of the corrosion.Pour the baking soda solution and continue removing the corrosion with your brush. Once you have finished, clean the terminals with clean water. It is prudent to smear some wheel bearing grease on the terminals to prevent further damage. Some people may opt for petroleum jelly, but this does not last as long as grease.2. SodaMost of the soft drinks that we take have some carbonic acid in them. Pour some of the soda on the terminals and use a soft sponge to remove the residue. This works well in the absence of a baking soda-water solution.3. Cleaning heavy corrosionIf your battery has excessive corrosion on the terminals, you will need to use a baking soda-water solution and an old toothbrush. Start by removing the battery terminals ? the negative should be first. Mix your baking soda solution and place it in cups. Soak each of the terminals in the solution and let it soak for the next 20 minutes.Scrub off the corrosive materials on the terminals. Pour in the soda solution and make a fresh one. Soak the battery terminals again while removing the corrosive materials. Clean the terminals with water and let them dry or wipe them with a damp cloth. You can also use sandpaper to clean the terminals. Apply some grease or Vaseline and reattach the terminals, starting with the positive one."
How to Prevent Battery Corrosion?	"Let?s take a little more detailed look over the few ways to prevent battery corrosion:1. Replace the car batteryBecause a leaking car battery causes a lot of battery corrosion, you may need to replace your car battery to prevent it from happening again soon.It is recommended to replace your car battery every five years to keep it in good condition.2. Copper compression terminalsThese clamps are one of the best in the market and will help prevent further battery terminal corrosion. The clamps are made from tinned copper and ensure that the whole clamp comes into contact with the electric current.3. Battery chargingOne of the causes of battery terminal corrosion is a battery that is overcharged or undercharged. The manufacturer?s manual often has the recommended battery voltage. Make sure you are not charging it too hard with your car battery charger.Also, check the voltage when the car is revving on idle with a multimeter. If the alternator is charging over 14.5 volts, there is something wrong with it.4. Anti-corrosive spraysVarious sprays are available on the market to prevent terminal corrosion. You can also use Vaseline or grease if you find the sprays expensive. Coated felt pads could also be used to prevent corrosion of the battery terminals."
How Many Volts is a Car Battery ? Ideal Range ?	"The voltage of a car battery should be between 12.2 to 12.6 volts when the engine is turned off. A fully charged car battery voltage falls between 13.7 and 14.7 volts with the engine running. With the battery charge at 75%, the voltage can drop to 12.4 volts. At 25% charged, the voltage will measure around 12 volts. By measuring the car battery, you can see where the voltage registers and you can compare it to the ideal car battery voltage range. However, even if it says it?s a 12-volt battery, different types of car batteries can measure slightly differently than others. It?s important to see what your particular car battery is rated for before measuring the voltage to know if the readings are good or bad. Steps to Test Car Battery Voltage1. Configure MultimeterWith a multimeter, you can quickly get a readout of the car battery?s voltage. These devices are quite inexpensive to buy and they will give you accurate readings.Allow the car to sit overnight before you test it. It?s best to test it after the car has been resting and then again with the engine running. Set the multimeter to DCV at 20. 2. Test BatteryTake the black lead of the multimeter and touch the negative terminal. Make sure you don?t touch the leads together.With your other hand, place the red lead (positive end) on the battery?s positive terminal. Once you read this measurement, you can follow the same steps with the engine running and record this figure as well. 3. Read MeasurementDepending on what type of multimeter you own, you will have a different way of reading the measurement. It could be shown on a dial range or you might have a digital multimeter that presents the figure on a screen. With the engine turned off, the voltage on the meter should be 12.4 to 12.6 volts on a healthy battery. The dimension should rise after you start the car engine and the alternator starts to charge the electrical system.If the reading is negative, you have the leads connected to the wrong sides and the circuit is flowing in the wrong direction. Switch the positive and negative to get a positive reading. "
how to Test Car Battery Without a Multimeter?	"If you can?t access a multimeter, you can still test the car battery. While the results won?t be as accurate as if you had the tool, these steps can give you an idea of the car battery?s health. You will at least recognize if the car battery is going to leave you stranded sometime soon.Park the car in front of a garage door or wall, where you can see the headlights clearly.Turn on the headlights for 15 minutes with the engine off.Turn the ignition to start the vehicle.The lights might dim briefly as the starter cranks the engine, but they should quickly regain brightness. If they become extremely dim or the engine struggles to start, you could be facing a dying or dead battery.If the lights don?t come back around with the engine running, you could also be looking at a discharge due to a failing alternator. The electrical equipment and lights should gain the power needed with the engine running because the alternator charging system supplies power.  When everything is working as it should, the headlights remain constant and bright, whether you are idling or revving the engine. Otherwise, have the car battery looked at. "
How to Performing a Car Battery Load Test ?	"With your multimeter, you can also perform a battery load test. Set the multimeter to 20 volts once again. If you don?t have this setting, it must at least be set above 15 volts. Test the battery voltage before you move on. With the vehicle off, turn the headlights on for two minutes. The battery should be able to support the headlights without interruption during these two minutes. Turn off the headlights and connect the multimeter to the battery once again. The reading should still be normal, even after running the headlights. If it is less than that, it?s not holding a charge well. Even better is to use a battery tester, this will be able to charge the battery so you can see the health of the battery. If the voltage drops drastically when you activate the load tester, you know that your battery is probably bad."
How Many Volts Does a Car Battery Need to Start?	"The car battery needs a different amount of voltage to start based on a few different factors. The season, whether it is winter or summer, can affect the starting voltage. Additionally, gas and diesel engines have different requirements, as well as the size of the engine. Beyond that, whether the engine is cold or already warmed will also make a difference.In general, if the engine hasn?t been running, the battery voltage will be around 12.6 volts. If the voltage reading goes below 12 volts, the battery might still be able to crank over the engine. Once it goes under 11.8 volts, the engine will struggle to start. It will be nearly impossible to start a car engine with a low voltage under 11 volts. "
When Should Car Battery Be Replaced?	"It is important to test the car battery every six months as the battery is one of the most important components in the car because it provides power to all electrical accessories in your car when the engine is not running. You should also check it if the temperatures drop significantly because colder weather can put a lot of stress on a battery that?s already struggling. If the battery isn?t holding a charge the way it should, you should replace it. If not, you could end up stranded with a car engine that won?t start. Of course, this situation never happens when it?s convenient.Most car batteries will last at least four years before they should be replaced. However, the way that you treat the battery has a lot to do with how long it will last. You can extend the battery life by taking longer drives. If you can only make short, irregular trips, it?s best to hook the car battery up to a charger when it is at home. Additionally, you want to physically inspect the battery periodically and keep the terminals free from corrosion."
How to Charge a Car Battery ?	"Charging a car battery may sound like a straightforward job. However, to do it properly, you need some knowledge. Here is how to charge your car battery safely. Remember always to use eye and skin protection when you are working with car batteries.Here?s the best way to charge a car battery:1. Turn Everything OffCar Light Switch OnBefore you get started, it?s vital that you shut everything off on the car. This includes the electrical features, as well as the exterior and interior lights. If you leave these items on, the battery could drain while you are charging it.Some car models also require you to remove the battery terminals before charging the battery not to damage electrical parts. Check your repair manual for your specific car model to be sure.If you need to test your battery moving on, use a voltmeter. Touch the prongs to the appropriate battery terminals to get a reading. 12.4 to 12.7 volts says that your 12-volt car battery is charged. Anything lower than 12 volts indicates low voltage, leaving you with a battery that might not start the engine.2. Set Charge RateBattery Charge Rate E1619977088430On your charger, you want to set the charge rate before you connect it to the battery. If you have a very basic battery charger, you might not have these options. Typically, the charge rate ranges from 2 to 10 amps.In most cases, you want to charge your battery on the lowest setting. By doing a slow charge, you ensure the battery remains in good condition. It also keeps you from overcharging the battery. The only time you should use a fast-charge setting is if you need the battery right away. While this will get you back on the road quickly, it will reduce the battery?s life significantly.3. Clean Battery TerminalsCorrosion Battery TerminalLocate the positive and negative battery terminals. Take off the plastic cover from the positive terminal and clean any corrosion off with a wire brush. If you are unable to remove the corrosion with the brush, consider using a baking soda paste instead. By cleaning off the battery, you ensure that the charger makes a good connection. 4. Connect Your ChargerBest Car Battery ChargersPut your battery charger in a close location where it is secure. Connect the clamp containing the red cable with the positive terminal on the battery. Make sure it is connected and isn?t going to fall off.Next, you will do the same with the black cable and the negative battery terminal. Once the charger is connected, you can turn it on. 5. Charge & Test BatteryStart EngineAllow the battery charger to stay connected until a full charge is achieved. Sometimes, this will take overnight. Once the battery is charged, remove the clips in the opposite order that you put them on.Replace the cap on the terminal and attempt to start your vehicle. If everything works well, you won?t need to worry about the battery. However, if the battery doesn?t work, you might need a replacement. "
"Slow Charge vs Fast Charge, Which is Better?"	The best way to charge a car battery is by slow-charging it for your battery?s health. Charging a car battery too fast can actually damage it. Therefore it is better to always charge with lower amps during a longer period instead if you are not in hurry.
What Does a Car Battery Do?	"Why is the car battery important and why should you ensure it is always charged? First, the car battery ensures the motor can turn over and start. When you put your key in the ignition, the battery is responsible for delivering the voltage needed to activate the starter. Additionally, the automotive battery provides voltage to the engine while it is running and powers up your important accessories. Without it, you wouldn?t have headlights, a car radio or anything else electronic in the vehicle. "
How Long to Charge a Car Battery?	"Determining how long it will take to charge a battery relies on several factors. First, it will depend on what type of charger you are using. Additionally, it depends on how dead the battery is. Charging an automotive battery fully can take a couple of hours or a few days. Using a partially charged battery is possible, but you run the chance of getting stranded somewhere, waiting for a jump start.If you do need to jump-start your vehicle, make sure you leave the engine running afterward. It?s best to take a drive and let the alternator charge the battery before shutting it down. If you turn off the engine too quickly after a jump start, you might find yourself stranded all over again. If the battery is completely dead, it?s possible that the jump start won?t work. Even if you leave it hooked up to a car charger, you will notice that nothing happens."
What to Do If a Car Battery Won?t Hold a Charge?	"If your battery isn?t holding a charge, you will need to get a replacement. Before having it towed to your local automotive shop, try a new battery. If you face the same problems after replacing the battery, it could be possible that isn?t your problem at all. In fact, many people replace the car battery only to find out that the alternator was defective, leaving the battery with no way to charge."
what are the Reasons that my Car Is Running Hot But Not Overheating ?	"Many of the same reasons the car runs hot and overheats will still apply. These include a bad thermostat, a clogged or defective radiator, a faulty coolant temperature sensor, a bad water pump, low coolant, air in the cooling system, a malfunctioning temperature gauge or a worn-out engine.1. Bad ThermostatCar ThermostatA main component of the cooling system is the engine coolant thermostat. This part is the gateway of the system, controlling the flow of coolant when the engine gets hot. If the engine is cold, the thermostat closes to keep the coolant from flowing. Once it gets hot, the thermostat opens for coolant to flow freely.Over time, the thermostat gets worn out and it can?t accurately measure the temperature. When this happens, it could open too late, allowing the engine to get hotter than it should. If the thermostat hasn?t completely failed yet, the engine might not overheat, but it could only be a matter of time. 2. Clogged or Bad RadiatorClogged RadiatorThe car radiator transfers heat away from the engine through a series of tubes. When hot coolant comes out of the engine, it circulates through the radiator to cool down. If a clog occurs or the radiator fails, the engine will get hotter. You may also notice coolant leaking or the color of the fluid could start to change. 3. Faulty Coolant Temperature SensorCoolant Temp SensorsThe coolant temperature sensor monitors how hot the liquid becomes. This measurement helps determine the air-fuel ratio since cooler engines require more fuel. When this sensor fails, the engine normally runs rich and it can also run too hot. You may also have a rougher idle or see black smoke coming from the exhaust. Furthermore, if the coolant temperature sensor runs the auxiliary fan in your car, it can fail, also leading to a hot engine. 4. Bad Water PumpWater Pump Replacement CostThe water pump is responsible for moving coolant from the radiator to the engine. Over time, the water pump will fail, normally giving warning signs first. When it stops operating efficiently, the engine tends to run on the hotter side. You may also see some coolant leaking from the pump or it could start to make a strange noise as it fails. 5. Low CoolantYour car must have the right amount of coolant for the engine to remain at the proper temperature. Engine coolant is a mixture of antifreeze and water. The antifreeze increases the boiling point of the water and keeps it from freezing when it?s cold. It also contains rust inhibitors to protect the engine. The ideal car temperature is between 195 and 220 degrees. When the coolant is too weak or there?s not enough, the heat won?t be absorbed properly as the liquid goes through the engine. You are then left with a hot motor. 6. Air in the Cooling SystemIn relation to the last problem, low coolant levels can also lead to air in the cooling system. It can also happen because of a blown head gasket or after a flush that wasn?t performed correctly.Either way, with air in the system, the coolant can?t flow properly and reduce the heat. It can also cause an airlock in the radiator.7. Bad Temperature GaugeFluctating Temperature Gauge E1609868224282Temperature gauges are reliable but also electronic, so they can fail. When the gauge itself is failing, it may start to act erratically. You may see the gauge jump up and down. The issue could also be a bad connection or defective wiring to the gauge, both of which should be inspected. 8. Overworked EngineIt?s possible that you are simply pushing the car too hard. If you are towing a heavy load, climbing a mountain or have packed the vehicle full of heavy cargo, you might be asking too much from it.You can also cause the car to run warm if it?s hot outside and you are sitting in traffic with the air conditioning on. Without the airflow through the radiator, the coolant can stay warmer than usual. "
what are Causes Of Car Overheats When AC is On ?	"If the car only overheats when the air conditioning is on, the engine load might be too high. You could also have mechanical issues, such as a failure with the condenser, an overloaded compressor, a defective temperature sensor, or a bad fan. Otherwise, it might just be an incompetent AC system.Here is a more detailed list of why your car overheats when the AC is on.1. Increased Engine LoadEngine LoadYour car?s engine is only able to handle so much. If you are pushing your car beyond its limits, the motor can start to overheat. Running the air conditioning adds to the load that?s put on the engine. If you do this in conjunction with towing heavy loads up steep inclines, the temperature may slowly climb.If you?ve ruled out any mechanical failures, you may want to look at how you are using your vehicle. It?s very possible that you are expecting too much from the car you have. 2. Condenser Installed In Front Of RadiatorAc Condenser LocationWith the condenser in front of the radiator, cool air can be stolen from where it needs to go. Without enough cold air in the radiator, it becomes more difficult to keep the engine temperature down.Additionally, condenser failure is always possible. Dirt and contaminants tend to build up in the fins of the condenser. When the fins become clogged, heat transfer doesn?t occur as efficiently. 3. Incompetent Cooling SystemIf there?s nothing wrong with the condenser, you may just have an incompetent cooling system. A faulty water pump can often be blamed. When the water pump stops working as it should, heat can?t be dissipated well. It?s also possible that there?s not enough coolant in the tank for proper cooling function. In other situations, a lack of AC refrigerant could be putting more stress on the system than what?s needed. 4. Overloaded AC CompressorAc Compressor CarWhen the AC is on, the compressor puts additional load on the engine. You can see this by watching your RPMs when you turn on the AC.If the compressor seizes or the accessory belt stops turning, failure can occur. Very quickly, the engine starts to overheat. 5. Bad Radiator FanThe cooling fan is required to keep the temperature down. If the cooling fan fails, the engine is going to overheat. However, you may not notice it as much when you are driving down the highway because the car?s speed keeps air flowing.It?s going to be most noticeable when you are stuck in traffic and running the AC. It can also happen if you start to drive slower and the radiator can?t get the air it needs. 6. Defective Engine Coolant Temperature SensorThe engine coolant temperature sensor is responsible for letting the control module know when the cooling fans should be turned on. If this fails, the engine could overheat.When the temperature sensor doesn?t send the right signal, coolant doesn?t flow as it should. This situation can get even worse if you are using the AC and putting an excessive load on the engine. "
How To Fix A Car That Overheats When AC is On?	"Once the car begins overheating, you want to diagnose the problem immediately. It?s important to keep the engine from overheating because permanent damage can quickly occur. Here are a few steps to help you figure out what?s going on. 1. Check Coolant LevelCheck CoolantBefore you go through any extensive steps, it?s best to start with the coolant level. It?s very possible that you just need to put a little more in. Only check the coolant when the vehicle is cool. Hot liquid is pressurized and can lead to damage.Locate the coolant reservoir. It?s under the hood, typically on the front or side of the engine.If the reservoir is transparent, you should be able to see the levels on the side. There should be a ?Cold? and ?Hot? line imprinted on the side.With the engine cool, the liquid should reach the Cold line. If not, you need to add more coolant.Take the cap off and add the right antifreeze mixture for your vehicle. If the coolant is low, you must also examine the system for leaks. Over time, gaskets, seals and hoses can all become worn out, allowing fluid to seep out. It?s important to fix these leaks before adding more fluid, or you will end up in the same boat later. "

Make Sure the Radiator and Condenser are Not DamagedDamaged Radiator FinsNext, you want to perform a check of the radiator and condenser. Here are some tips to consider.Use a flashlight. It can be dark around the radiator tank. Inspect the radiator and condenser for any wet spots. This problem indicates seepage and damage.Look at the radiator core for any signs of leaks.Inspect the upper and lower hose clamps on the radiator. Tighten them if necessary.Check the fins of the radiator and condenser and ensure they are not clogged or damaged.Open the oil dipstick to ensure there?s no coolant leaking into the motor. If you notice any damage, have it repaired right away. For the cost of a radiator or condenser, you can save yourself from a much higher bill than with an engine replacement. 3. Inspect the Radiator/AC Condenser FanMost of today?s radiators have an electric fan. With these fans, you can use a multimeter to test operation.Turn off the car engine.Locate the fuse box. Normally, it?s under the dash.Set the multimeter to DCV (Direct Current Voltage). Select the range that?s best for the 12V circuit.Put the negative multimeter lead to the negative battery terminal post.Connect the red multimeter lead to the fuse contact for the radiator fan. If the reading is around 12V, the fuse is fine. Otherwise, a blown fuse will give you a 0V reading on one side. A 0V reading on both contacts means there?s no power coming to the fuse either. Aside from a blown fuse, the fan may also not be working because there?s something holding it up. Physically inspect the fan for any debris holding it up and clean it out when appropriate.4. Refill and Diagnose the AC SystemIf a lack of AC refrigerant could be to blame, refill it. You want the AC system working its best to reduce the load on the engine. Aside from this, you want to fix any mechanical issues you?ve found. Remember to reference your car?s service manual for the proper steps for your vehicle. 5. Connect an OBD ScannerIf there are warning lights on the dashboard, your code scanner can help you figure out what?s wrong. Plug your compatible OBDII scanner into the port under the steering wheel. It should reveal a code or codes that can be used to determine the problem. Reference the information you receive with our online trouble code library to fix the issues. 6. Contact a ProfessionalNot everyone understands the basics of the cooling system and that?s okay. If you aren?t sure where to start, reach out to a local mechanic for more help.Even if you can figure out what?s wrong, there could be times when the issue is over your head or you don?t have the equipment needed. There?s no shame in getting some help to ensure the fault is repaired properly. "
Can a bad AC compressor cause a car to overheat?	"The compressor isn?t going to cause a direct fault that overheats the engine. However, when the compressor clutch engages without proper operation, there will be an extra strain on the engine. This problem can quickly lead to an overheating engine. "
Can an overcharged AC cause an overheating engine?	"When the air conditioning system is overcharged, the compressor can fail. Any damage to the compressor can put extra strain on the engine. If it?s not repaired right away, the engine may start overheating because of the stress. "
Does the car AC make the engine hotter?	"The air conditioner does put additional load on the engine. If the engine is already prone to overheating, having to work harder may throw it over the edge. In some cases, you can stop the engine from overheating simply by turning off the air conditioner. "
Does turning off the AC prevent overheating?	"If there?s a failure in the cooling system, the AC system isn?t going to make a difference or change the problem. However, you can reduce the load on the engine by turning off the AC. This simple change may give you a little more time to drive home without overheating the motor. "
what Symptoms Of A Bad Car AC Condenser Fan ?	"The most common symptom of a bad AC condenser fan is a hot cabin with non-functional air conditioning. You may also notice signs like a burning smell from the engine bay or warning lights on your dashboard.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing AC condenser fan to look for:1. Lukewarm AirAc Blowing AirWhen the AC condenser fan begins to fail, this is going to be your first symptom. You turn on the air conditioning and all you are met with is lukewarm air blowing in your face. The AC condenser fan could be your problem, but so could other issues. For example, when the refrigerant levels are low, the air coming out of the system will also be warm.2. Burning SmellBad Fuel Odor Smell E1609793024317Your vehicle needs to release the hot air that?s building up in the system. When it can?t, the internal temperature of the AC parts becomes so hot that they start to burn and emit a putrid smell. You will notice this burning odor when you turn on the AC system. If you smell anything burning, turn off the air conditioning right away. Otherwise, you might be replacing multiple parts instead of just the fan. 3. Refrigerant LeakAc Leak SealerThe AC condenser is responsible for holding refrigerant that is pressurized. If the fan fails to cool the condenser, this pressure and heat become noticeably higher, leaving the condenser vulnerable to breaking. Leaks occur when the seals fail or when lines break. What might turn out as a simple fan replacement could require a complete overhaul of the AC system. 4. Overheating During IdleAdditionally, when the AC system cannot circulate cooled refrigerant through the system, the heat begins to build up. In some rare cases, you might see this problem with steam coming from the radiator, but the majority of the time, there are no signs occurring. Once you get moving again, the overheating should cease as airflow becomes noticeable, but the overheating can cause serious damage. The radiator often uses the same fan as the AC system, so if this fan is not working, you may also notice an overheating engine.5. Warning LightMost older vehicles don?t have sensors to alert you when there is an air conditioning problem, but newer cars have sensors for just about everything.If there is a problem with the air conditioning system, you might get a warning light on your dashboard. Check the owner?s manual to determine what indicator lights your vehicle contains. "
where are the Car AC Condenser Fan Location ?	"The car AC condenser fan is located under the hood of your vehicle, in the front of the car. There will in most cases be two fan assemblies. One is used on the radiator, while the other is found on the condenser. To tell them apart, you might need to reference your car?s service manual. Many cars use the same fan for both the radiator and the condenser though.Anytime the air conditioning is on, your condenser fan should be running. If you start the engine, you should see this fan spinning with the AC system. If it?s not, you need to replace it. "
what are The Function of an AC Condenser Fan ?	"The air conditioning system works by exchanging heat and relying on pressurized gradients. Cars use refrigerant, which is converted from a liquid into a gas and back again through the closed system. For this system to work properly, there can?t be any leaks and all components must operate as intended. The AC compressor is driven by the car?s crankshaft. It is responsible for pressurizing the refrigerant gas. At this point in the system, the AC moves from low pressure to high pressure. From here, the high-pressure refrigerant moves into the AC condenser, which acts as a small radiator. The heat is removed, with the help of the condenser fan. When the heat is removed, the gas condenses back into a liquid. Therefore, the condenser and fan are critical components when it comes to removing heat from the AC system. When the condenser fan cannot do its job, the pressure isn?t removed and the gas continues on through the system when it should be liquefied. This refrigerant is going to infiltrate the drier/accumulator and expansion valve or orifice tubes at higher pressures than it should. "
what are the AC Condenser Fan Replacement Cost ?	"The average AC condenser fan replacement cost is between $300 and $425. The parts are priced at $245 to $330, while labor could be $55 to $200, depending on your make and model. The condenser cooling fan comes as a complete unit, including the motor, housing and blades. It doesn?t? make sense to only replace one aspect of the unit. However, a bad AC condenser fan can easily be misdiagnosed. Because the system is blowing warm air, many technicians add refrigerant thinking that the system is low, but this only further complicates the situation. Additionally, the motor relay or fan control module will be replaced because the fan isn?t running, but this could also be a mistake. "
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad AC Pressure Switch ?	"The most common symptom of a bad AC pressure switch is a faulty or intermittent air conditioning function. In most cases, you will notice this during hot days when your car is not blowing any cold air through the vents.To find out how to solve the problem, let?s take a look at a more detailed list of the most common signs of a bad AC pressure switch:1. Intermittent Air ConditioningAc Blowing AirThis AC system symptom can show up in numerous ways. You might notice that the system starts up and cuts out for a short time. Or, it might only work occasionally, leaving you hot most of the time. Either way, when the air conditioning only offers intermittent usage, it?s a good sign that the AC pressure switch is faulty. To become comfortable again, you will need to have the switch replaced.2. Air Conditioning Stops WorkingWhat?s worse than the air conditioning working intermittently? How about when it stops working at all? If your AC doesn?t run, the refrigerant pressure switch sensor might be defective.However, many components make up the air conditioning system, so your problem could be entirely different. 3. Warm Air is BlowingWhen you turn on the air conditioning, you expect to feel cold air pour out. However, when the AC pressure switch goes bad, warm air might be all you get. However, this problem is also caused by low refrigerant levels, which should be checked regularly. 4. Strange Air Conditioning System NoisesIf the compressor is clicking off and on, you are going to notice some strange sounds from the engine and under your dashboard. It will sound like the clicking occurring when the compressor normally activates, except the air won?t work. Listen for the distinct clicking noises from both under your car?s dashboard and in the engine compartment, telling you that the switch is turning the compressor off and on. "
where are the AC Pressure Switch Location ?	"The AC pressure switches are located on the AC pipes on both sides of the AC compressor. You will find the low pressure AC switch on the low pressure side (smaller pipe) and the other on the high pressure side (large pipe).The low pressure side switch is located before the AC compressor, while the high pressure switch comes after the compressor.Most AC pressure switches are found within the engine compartment, but some manufacturers put them elsewhere. A look in your service manual will show you the appropriate location for your model. "
what are the AC Pressure Switch Function?	"The function of the AC pressure switch is to provide safety monitoring over the AC system. It is responsible for monitoring the refrigerant pressure on both the low and high-pressure sides of the AC compressor. One monitors the high-pressure side, while the other evaluates the low-pressure side.The low pressure switch ensures that the pressure never drops too low. This problem occurs when a leak occurs. When the AC compressor pumps out refrigerant without the correct pressure, it can cause significant damage to the compressor, leading to higher repair costs.The high pressure switch monitors any blockages in the system that would lead to more pressure on the high pressure side. If the pressure builds up too high, an explosion can occur in the system. That?s why the switch tells the system to shut off power to the air conditioner ? so no more pressure builds up."
How to Test an AC Pressure Switch?	"To test an AC pressure switch, you can use a multimeter. Use the Ohm setting on your multimeter and measure between the signal and the ground pin. The ohm should be 0 when the switch is closed, and no open circuit when it?s open. However, check a repair manual for the correct values for your car model.Here are a few more steps on how to test an AC pressure switch:1. Turn On Air ConditioningLeave the engine running and turn on the air conditioning in full blast. Make sure you have the windows open, so the air doesn?t cycle itself.The first sign that the air conditioning pressure switch is bad is when the system shuts off intermittently. This shouldn?t happen with the windows wide open. 2. Scan for Trouble CodesWith the OBDII port on your vehicle, you can use a code scanner to check for DTCs. You can also use the code scanner to erase codes once you repair the problem. If you don?t have an engine code reader, consider stopping at your local auto parts store, where they might offer the service for free.If you find a trouble code on the AC pressure switch circuit, you need to measure the wires to the switch, and if they seem good, you need to replace the AC pressure switch. If the error code says the pressure is too low, it could also be due to a low refrigerant level.Many modern vehicles have an electronically controlled AC system, and in this case you can see the values coming from the pressure sensors with the scanner. Connect your OBD scanner, activate the AC system and check the values coming from the AC pressure switches.3. Test Electrical ConnectionsIf your car don?t have the ability to check the AC system with a scanner, you need to do it manually. The first thing you want to do is check a wiring diagram and repair manual for your particular car model.Check if your AC pressure switch has two or three wires. If there are two wires, these are normally just a signal and a ground wire. If there are three wires, it probably has a 5 volt wire, signal, and ground. However, you must confirm this with a wiring diagram.Measure between the signal and ground pin with a multimeter and check Ohms. You should see 0 ohms when the switch is closed and an open circuit when the switch is open. Normally the AC pressure switch is closed when the pressure is correct and working properly.You can also measure if there is 5 volts, ground, and a signal coming from the engine control module at the AC pressure switch connector. If there is something wrong with the values, you need to check the wiring. However, you need a wiring diagram for this.4. Check AC PressuresIf your AC pressure switch seems to be fine, use your air conditioning gauge set to check for adequate levels on both sides. You will attach the low-pressure gauge to the low-pressure fitting and vice versa. On the low-pressure side, you should see readings near 30 PSI when the temperature outside is 90 degrees or less. The high-pressure side should be around twice the ambient temperature with 50 PSI added. If the low or high pressures are off, you may need to refill the refrigerant, or there may be a larger problem with the system. "
what are the AC Pressure Switch Replacement Cost ?	"The average AC pressure switch replacement cost is between $50 and $300. To buy the AC pressure switch, you will likely spend between $20 and $100, while labor can cost $30 to $200, depending on how difficult it is to reach the sensors. When replacing the AC pressure switch, in most cases you do not need to drain and refill the coolant system, because there is a check valve inside the AC pipe that does not allow the refrigerant to pour out even if you remove the AC pressure switch.However, you should remove the AC pressure switch carefully to confirm that this is the case on your car model."
What does the AC pressure switch control?	"AC pressure switches monitor the low and high pressure sides of the air conditioning system. If either side?s pressure gets too high or too low, it will shut off the power sent to the AC compressor and disable the air conditioning system."
How do you bypass an AC pressure switch?	"It depends on what type of AC push switch your car uses, but if it?s an old two-pin switch, you?ll just have to run a wire between the pins instead of the switch to bypass it. However, this is not recommended, as it may lead to damage to the system. Check a wiring diagram and repair manual before."
Are AC pressure switches normally open or closed?	"The AC pressure switch?s circuit is normally closed when operating, so if a wire gets damaged or you have an open circuit, it will switch off the AC system to prevent further damage. However, you need to check a repair manual to confirm this for your particular car model."
How do you jump an AC pressure switch?	"To jump an AC pressure switch, if you have an old two-pin switch, simply remove the connector and bridge a wire between the pins of the connector. However, only do this if you know what you are doing, and check a wiring diagram. You can damage the system badly if you don?t do things correctly."
How often do AC pressure switches go bad?	"On older cars, it was more common for AC pressure switches to go bad. However, on modern car models, they seem to be quite reliable, even if they are more advanced than they were before. Generally, an AC pressure switch will go bad once or twice in a car?s lifetime."
Can you drive with a bad AC pressure switch?	"Yes. You can drive your car with a bad AC pressure switch with no problem, but the AC system won?t work. When the AC pressure switch is bad, it will switch off the power sent to the AC compressor, which will then not engage and cool the air conditioning system."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad AC Compressor?	"The most common symptom of a bad AC compressor is warm or fluctuating air-conditioning temperatures. You may also hear noises coming from the AC compressor if you open the hood. In some cases, you can also see refrigerant leaks around the compressor.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing AC compressor to look for:1. A/C System Blows warm airCar Ac Not Blowing Cold AirThis may seem like an obvious first choice on the list. However, there are a number of things to look out for, which could point to a bad compressor being at fault if your A/C stops working. If your vehicle indicates that your A/C should be on (usually by a little light on the A/C button), but you don?t feel a temperature change, this could point towards a faulty compressor. A good way to check if your compressor is the fault here is to check your A/C compressor?s power feed. The compressor will usually have a 2-pin connector situated on the exterior of the body. As the vehicle is running and the A/C is switched on, you should have a live feed going to the pump. If your compressor has the correct feeds to it but still isn?t working, this would suggest a faulty A/C compressor. 2. Noise From AC Compressor Engine Ticking NoiseAs you can imagine, when the compressor?s clutch is engaged, the internals of the pump are working incredibly hard to keep up with the demand. Once the bearings and other metallic components start to wear and become noisy inside the compressor, you will usually begin to notice a harsh grinding noise coming from the engine. A good way to determine if it?s your compressor that?s making this noise is to try switching your A/C on and off and listen out for any changes in the grinding noise. If you notice that the noise disappears when the pump is switched off, this would indicate that your compressor?s internals has worn and will require the unit to be replaced. 3. Compressor Clutch is not movingAc Compressor ClutchMost ac compressors? pulleys consist of two parts. The inner pulley will spin at all times with the engine without turning the axle into the compressor. It also has an outer clutch on this pulley which is engaged when the AC compressor should start.If this clutch has failed, it will not engage and turn the compressor axle. No electrical power can also cause this to the compressor, so it needs to be diagnosed properly.This is more a sign of a bad ac compressor clutch rather than a bad ac compressor, though. However, if the ac compressor clutch is bad, you often have to replace the compressor.Newer cars mostly use variable AC compressors, which means they spin all the time and do not have this clutch.4. Burning Rubber smell from the engine bayCar Smells Burning RubberIf you notice a burning rubber smell from the engine bay when you try to turn on the AC, it can mean that the AC compressor is seized and that the serpentine belt will spin on the ac compressor pulley.This will cause the serpentine belt to snap off quite quickly, though, so if you have been noticing it for a long time, there is most likely something else that is the problem with your car.5. Auxiliary Drive Belt Excessively Wearing Serpentine Belt LocationIf you?ve had to replace your auxiliary drive belt recently, and have noticed that your new one has started to wear out quite quickly, or is making a squealing noise, then it may be worth checking your A/C compressor?s pulley. As your compressor?s pulley begins to wear out, it can develop excessive movement in its bearings that cause the pulley to run at varying angles. This movement will often cause snatching and grabbing of the rubber auxiliary drive belt and cause it to wear out prematurely. Or this excessive movement can give off a high pitch squeal as the rubber belt rubs against the now unaligned pulley. To determine if this is your fault, remove the auxiliary drive belt from the A/C compressor and physically check the pulley for any excessive free play. Some compressors allow their pulleys to be changed without replacing the whole unit; unfortunately, this is rarely the case, and a worn pulley will often mean replacing the compressor itself. 6. Refrigerant Leak Ac Compressor RefillYour vehicle?s A/C system has sensors in place to determine how much refrigerant there is within the pipework. If your vehicle develops a leak on one of these pipes and loses its refrigerant, your lower pressure switch will detect this and stop your compressor from running to not damage it from running dry. A refrigerant leak on a vehicle can often be difficult to find due to the inaccessibility of the components that you?re trying to assess. However, a good place to start if you?re looking for a leak is the compressor body itself. If the compressor has begun to over compress the refrigerant due to a fault internally, this can cause excessive heat and pressure to build up within the compressor?s body and can cause its seals to burst. Thus"
At What Speed Do Airbags Deploy?	"According to the IIHS, front airbags deploy between 10 and 12 mph when an unbelted occupant is involved in an impact that involves a rigid wall. Belted occupants won?t have the airbags deployed until around 16 mph because the belts provide more protection. Additionally, side airbags deploy around 8 mph when there?s a narrow object crash, such as a pole or a tree. The deployment occurs around 18 mph when the side impact is more widely distributed. "
What Triggers Airbag Deployment?	"In your vehicle, there are various airbag sensors monitoring for any potential crashes. The sensors are located around the vehicle, based on where the corresponding airbag is. For example, front airbags are going to use sensors in the front of the vehicle, while a side airbag receives information from the side of the car.When a collision occurs, the sensors relay the data to the car?s computer. If the speed is high enough and the collision fits the required parameters, the corresponding airbags will deploy. "
How Do Airbags Work?	"Front airbags are located in the steering wheel of the vehicle and in front of the passenger. There are also airbags at other locations. For example, your car may contain these airbags.Front airbags (required by law)Side airbags (for side impacts)Side curtain airbags (for rollover incidents)Knee airbags (to prevent shattering kneecaps)Inflatable seat belts (to spread the impact across a larger area of the body)Airbags are made from a light material. When activated, the airbag fills up with gas. This process only takes a fraction of a second, so there?s no waiting around. When the airbag is full, the person receives complete cushioning from the impact. The airbags are meant to protect from head injuries, spinal cord injuries, lacerations and more. "
Why Would Airbags Not Deploy?	"While airbags have come a long way over the years, malfunctions can still occur. In some cases, the airbags may not deploy even though you think they should have. Yet, in many cases, the lack of deployment is just normal operation. Here are the four most common reasons that the airbags won?t deploy. 1. SpeedIf an accident occurs at low speeds, the airbag may not deploy. The cost to replace an airbag can be very high, depending on your car model. Therefore, you don?t want the airbag to come out for a simple fender bender. If your speeds don?t exceed the levels discussed above, you can expect the airbag to remain intact. In some cases, the airbag can deploy when you aren?t moving at all, such as when the object hitting you is moving at a fast rate of speed. However, the engine must be running for this to occur. Airbags aren?t going to deploy when the car is parked and turned off. If the airbag hasn?t deployed at higher speeds, you are looking at one of the other problems. 2. Nature of the AccidentSide AirbagsAirbags only deploy for certain types of accidents. According to the NHTSA, the impact?s location is going to be one of the largest factors determining if the airbag should deploy. As an example, the front airbags should deploy when there?s a moderate to severe impact to the car?s front bumper or corner of the vehicle. The sensors must be struck for the airbag to be deployed. For this reason, a front airbag may not deploy if you are involved in a rear-end accident or side collision. On the flip side, various airbags can deploy during a rollover incident simply because of how many sensors get activated. 3. Passenger Airbag Switched OffPassenger Airbag SwitchWhen there?s not a passenger in the car, that airbag isn?t going to deploy. There?s no reason for the added repair cost if there?s no occupant to protect. The front airbags system contains sensors in the passenger seat on most car models to determine when to activate. If there?s no one there or a smaller person, such as a child, the airbag will deactivate. On many car models, there is also an ON/OFF switch for the airbag, and if it?s switched off, it won?t deploy at all.4. Faulty Airbag ComponentsThe airbag system is complicated and includes numerous parts. If any one of these parts fails, it can cause airbag issues. Modern vehicles have an airbag light to show you when something has failed. For this reason, you should pay attention to this light and take action to have it repaired immediately. "
Will Airbags Deploy When the Car Isn?t Moving?	"It might surprise you to know that the airbags can deploy even if you are sitting still. Let?s say you are sitting at a red light and a vehicle comes barreling through to hit you head-on. As long as that vehicle is traveling fast enough, your front airbags are going to activate and inflate. On the other hand, your airbags can?t go off if the engine isn?t running. Therefore, if you are sitting in a parking lot and the car is off, your airbags won?t deploy during a head-on collision. Airbag LawsuitsEven though the airbag is designed to prevent injury in a crash, it is also the subject of injuries from time to time. When the airbag doesn?t deploy as it should, it can allow for more significant injuries that wouldn?t have occurred otherwise. For this reason, lawyers across the country file wrongful injury and death cases against automakers on a regular basis.What?s more alarming is when the airbag system is defective, leading to increased injuries. An example of this can be seen with the massive Takata airbag recall. This recall occurred because around 67 million airbags could explode when deployed. Not only does this defect lead to larger injuries, but it can also cause death. If your vehicle is part of this recall and hasn?t been repaired, it has been issued a Do Not Drive warning. You should park the vehicle until it can be repaired by an authorized dealer. Continuing to drive only puts you at risk for an injury. "
At What Speed Do Airbags Deploy In A Rear-End Collision?	Front airbags don?t normally deploy during a rear-end collision unless it causes a chain reaction that causes you to hit something in front of you. The sensors for the front airbags are located in the front of the vehicle and don?t generally get activated during a rear-end collision. 
At What Speed Do Side Airbags Deploy?	"Side airbags tend to deploy around 8 mph if a narrow object crash is involved, such as a pole or a tree. The deployment should also happen at speeds of about 18 mph when the side impact is more widely distributed. In some cases, a side impact can also cause the front airbags to deploy. Also, if a vehicle hits you at a high enough speed, but your car is stationary, it will still deploy the side airbags."
At What Speed Should Airbags Deploy in the UK?	"Despite popular belief, the UK measures speed in mph, not km. For that reason, the front airbags should deploy between 10 and 20 mph, depending on whether the occupant has a seat belt on or not. It will also depend on whether the object that has been hit is rigid or soft. "
At What Speed Do Airbags Deploy In Km?	"By converting the deployment speed from mph to km, you can see when the airbag should inflate. On average, the airbags deploy between 16 and 32 km/h. Additionally, the front sensors need to hit a solid object for the airbags to deploy. "
How do airbags work?	"So before we look at how to reset the airbag light, you should know how the whole system works.Airbags are lifesavers when you are speeding and hit another car head-on or hit a stationary object. If you do not have an airbag, you could hit your head hard on the steering wheel or dashboard. When you hit something at high speed, your car will decelerate, and this will activate an accelerometer that triggers the airbag circuit.The airbag circuit has a heating element activated through an electric current. This heating element promotes an explosion inside the airbag that rapidly generates a harmless gas. Most airbags use sodium azide as the explosive element, and the gas produced can either be argon or nitrogen. This gas floods the airbag and causes it to expand; hence, protecting the driver from injuries by occupying the steering wheel and the side. The airbag acts as a cushion."
How to reset the airbag light with a scanner?	"Now that we know how airbags operate, it is time to learn how to reset the airbag light.All work done to the airbag system should be done by professionals if you are not 100% sure of what you are doing! Follow these steps to reset the airbag light:Total Time: 1 hourStep 1: Check the passenger airbag switchAirbag SwitchSome cars have a ?passenger seat Airbag on/off button.? This is the first thing you should check when you want to remove the airbag light. Maybe someone before you turned it to ?Off? by mistake ? this will make the airbag light stay on in most cars.This button is usually on the dashboard on the passenger side, and you may see it if you open the passenger door or the glove box.Step 2: Read the trouble codes with an OBD2 ScannerCar Trouble CodesWorking with your airbag system is crucial. You should always read the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner to get an idea of where to start your troubleshooting. Never clear the trouble codes before you fix the problem caused by the airbag light. Read the codes and get information about what can cause the problem and continue the diagnosis.Step 3: Repair the faultRepair Airbag ClockspringYou should never just reset the airbag light without repairing the problem. This can deploy the airbags or prevent them from functioning if an accident occurs. Let a professional replace the airbag?s parts if you are not sure how to do it. Remember always to remove the battery connection when working with airbags. The airbag light will often go away by itself after repairing the problem, but not in all car models.Step 4: Clear the trouble codesClear Trouble CodesAfter you have installed the new parts and are 100% sure that the parts are installed correctly, it?s time to reset the engine light. To do this, you need to use an OBD2 scanner. There is no other way to reset. Reset the airbag light and make sure that it has disappeared from the dashboard. If it is still there, reread the codes and check for any trouble codes.Step 5: Restart your car & test-drive.Drive CarIf the airbag light seems to have gone away from your dashboard, restart your ignition and go for a test drive. If the airbag light is gone after a test drive, there is a big chance that the problem has been solved. If the problem comes back, reread the codes and continue the procedure."
How to reset the airbag light without a scanner?	"It is impossible in most car models to reset the airbag light without a scanner. This is for safety reasons, because you should always repair the fault after the airbag light has come on. Luckily, in many car models, the airbag light will also go away by itself if you have repaired the problem.In some older cars, though, it is possible to reset the airbag light without a scanner by removing the car battery terminals.Check the wiring system underneath the driver or passenger seat for any loose wires or corrosion in the connector plug. Spray the connector plugs with an electronic cleaner and restart your car.If you can not find any problems there, you should really get an OBD2 scanner or let a workshop read the codes; otherwise, you will be taking a stab in the dark when you try to guess the problem."
What happens if you pull the airbag fuse?	"If you pull the fuse to the airbag control module, it will disable the airbag function in your car after 1-2 minutes. However, it won?t remove the airbag light as you might expect. If the dash does not receive a signal from the airbag module, it will illuminate the airbag warning light."
How can I bypass the airbag light?	"You can bypass the airbag light or the airbag parts by bridging them with resistors. However, we strongly recommend fixing the issues instead, because if you?re in a serious accident, you?ll probably wish the airbag function was working."
How much does it cost to reset the airbag light?	"Resetting the airbag light can cost anywhere from $0 to $1000. It all depends on what are causing the airbag light. If the problem was only temporary, it might be enough to simply reset the codes, which can be done for free. It can also be caused by an expensive faulty part like the steering angle sensor, which can cost you over $1000."
Does disconnecting the battery disable the airbag?	"Yes and no. Airbag systems have large capacitors that will store energy in the system for a while even if you remove the battery cable. However, this energy is often drained within minutes."
Conclusion 	"To reset an airbag or SRS light, you need to use a diagnostic scanner to clear the codes after you repair the issue. In most modern cars, there is no way to reset the airbag light without a scanner.If you clear the codes, but the airbag light keeps coming back on, there is a problem that needs to be fixed first. You should never attempt to reset the airbag light without correcting the problem first, because this could cause the airbags to deploy.Now you know how to handle the airbag light. You may understand the safety importance when working on airbags or SRS systems in a car. If you feel that you don?t have the knowledge to work on airbag systems, take it to a mechanic and have them run a diagnostic test."
Is It Safe to Drive with the Airbag Light On?	"No. It?s not safe to drive with the airbag light on. When the airbag light illuminates, it means that there is a problem with the system. Most likely, the airbag will not deploy in an accident because of this fault. Therefore, it is not recommended that you drive the car until you have the system repaired. You should never ignore this vital warning. While it doesn?t mean the car is unsafe to drive, there?s no reason to take chances with it. However, the light does indicate that the SRS components are not working as they should. This could also mean that the airbags won?t deploy if an accident occurs. You don?t want to wait until you are in an accident to find out if the airbags will protect you. "
what are the SRS Airbag Light?	"The Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) controls the car?s airbags. It?s designed to work with the seatbelts to provide another level of in-vehicle safety. The SRS sensors monitor all of the airbags in your vehicle, which could total ten or more in the newest models.The job of the sensors is to detect when a collision occurs so the airbags can deploy and reduce the impact. However, the sensors also determine if there is a fault in the system, which causes the airbag light to illuminate on the dashboard. "
Is it Illegal to Drive with the Airbag Light On?	"While it isn?t wise to drive with the airbag light on, you can?t get into criminal trouble for doing so. Local and state laws have no bearing on whether you are allowed to drive with dashboard lights on your car.However, you might have trouble getting the car to pass a state inspection with these lights on. In fact, many states will fail a vehicle for having the SRS light, Check Engine Light or ABS light illuminated. "
Will the Airbag Deploy with the SRS Light On?	"When the airbag warning light is on, it?s safe to assume that the airbags are not going to deploy in an accident. When the system detects a fault, it deactivates the airbags for your protection. For this reason, you won?t have to worry about the airbags deploying spontaneously because of the failure. To ensure your on-road protection, it?s critical that you have the light looked at right away.Common Reasons Airbag Light is OnDeployed Airbags1. Dead Backup BatteryThe airbag operates with the help of a backup battery. If your automotive battery died recently, it?s also possible that the power to the backup battery is dead.Once you charge the car battery, the backup might start working again, causing the light to go off. Otherwise, it needs to be replaced and the sensors need to be reset. 2. Faulty SensorThe sensors are needed to determine if a crash is occurring, so the airbags can deploy. However, these sensors can also fail because of old age or wear. When the sensors stop working correctly, the system detects a fault and the light comes on. You will need to have the sensors checked, and the system needs a reset to work properly again.3. Damaged Clock SpringThere is a clock spring with the airbag that maintains the continuity of the driver?s side airbag with the electrical wiring. The clock spring is built into the steering wheel and moves with the turns. Over time, it can become worn out, leading to a bad connection and airbag failure. To repair it, the clock spring must be replaced, and the SRS needs to be reset. 4. Water DamageIf your vehicle has become a victim of water damage, anything electrical could be damaged, including the airbag module. This valuable part is located below your seats.When it becomes shorted or corroded, it will stop working, leading to the light coming on. While you can replace the damaged part, it will only happen again unless you stop water from infiltrating the vehicle. "
what are the Cost to Repair Airbag Light?	"The cost to repair the airbag light depends on what fault has occurred. If the airbag in the steering wheel needs to be replaced for some reason, you could spend $1,100 to $1,500, mainly for the labor involved. However, replacing the clock spring should only cost $250 to $350, or less if you can repair it yourself.The average cost to replace an airbag sensor is between $350 and $450, with the parts averaging around $300. Because the codes will need to be reset, it?s best to have a mechanic perform the fix unless you have an advanced code scanner."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Airbag Sensor ?	"The most common symptom of a bad airbag sensor is an airbag light on your dashboard. The other symptom is something you never want to happen, and that is your airbag won?t deploy in an accident.There are actually two different symptoms you can expect when you have a broken airbag sensor."
what are an Airbag Sensor?	"The sensor is basically a detecting device that can read rapid deacceleration of the vehicle and generates a signal as a response.Its basic function is to electronically communicate the information with the electronic control unit and all the equipment related to the airbag system.The intensity of the collision is also noted, and is used to determine whether or not the airbag should inflate."
Where Is the Airbag Crash Sensor Located?	"Usually, you have two airbag sensors located in the front of your vehicle behind the bumper. There is often also one airbag sensor installed inside each door of your car.A car usually has several different airbag sensors installed, so to determine the exact location of the airbag sensors, you have to specify which one you want to find.The best way to go about finding the airbag sensor?s location in your vehicle is to refer to the service manual provided by your manufacturer."
Airbag Crash Sensor Replacement cost?	"The average airbag sensor replacement cost is between $100 and $600, depending on the car model and labor costs. An airbag sensor costs $50 to $300, and labor costs $50 to $300.The airbag sensor is a sensitive component, and so is the replacement. It can take as long as 2 hours, even for a professional, to properly diagnose and install the airbag sensor.The airbag sensor itself is often not super expensive, and you can expect to get a new one for $50 to $300. You should always buy a genuine OEM original, and never buy aftermarket sensors ? do not take the risk!If you feel very comfortable repairing cars and closely following the repair manual, you can save money and replace the airbag sensor yourself.If you feel the slightest doubt about the replacement, let a professional do it instead.Remember that it is an essential part, and you want to install it correctly in case of an accident. There is also a risk that you will deploy all airbags in the car if you do something wrong, which will cost several thousands of dollars to restore."
How to test an airbag impact sensor?	"Testing of an airbag sensor is possible, but should not be done.The only way you should safely test an airbag sensor is to use an automotive diagnostic tool to read the airbag control unit?s trouble codes and live data.Check for any measuring values inside your diagnostic tool and, if there is a trouble code on the sensor, measure the wirings between the airbag and the airbag sensor.If the airbag sensor?s wirings and connector are fine and the airbag control module says there is a problem with the airbag sensor, replace it!They are often not super expensive, and you do not want to mess around with these parts, because you really want it to work if the accident occurs!"
How do I know if my airbag sensor is bad?	"A bad airbag sensor will trigger a red airbag warning light on the dashboard. In normal circumstances, this light will illuminate when you turn on the ignition, but should shut down after a few seconds. If it stays on, there is an issue with the airbag system, and this can be the sensor, the airbag itself, or any other corresponding components."
Will my airbag deploy if the sensor is bad?	"In most cases, airbags will not deploy if their sensors are bad. This sensor, in simple words, detects when the vehicle is in a crash by measuring the acceleration. With the sensor not working, the airbag control modules will not know when and if to activate the airbags. This is why you need to replace faulty airbag sensors without any delays."
Do airbag sensors need to be replaced?	"Airbag sensors are not wear-and-tear items, so they shouldn?t be replaced as a part of any regular or preventive maintenance. However, they will need to be replaced if the vehicle was in an accident or the sensor was damaged during other repairs. And with airbag sensors being such safety-critical components, there is no room for improvisation or botched repairs when having a bad one."
How much does it cost to fix airbag sensors?	"The cost of fixing a faulty airbag sensor depends on the car and who?s doing the repair. For most cars, a single airbag sensor costs between $50 to $300. And, depending on the particular situation, you?ll sometimes have to replace more than one. In addition, if having this done by a mechanic, you?ll have to count in the labor costs, which range from $100 to $300."
Is it OK to drive with the airbag light on?	"No. Driving with the airbag light on is not okay, as this is not safe. In most cases, the airbag system will not function when this warning light is on. This means the airbags would not deploy in a crash, increasing the risk of an injury. You may think that driving more carefully could be a temporary solution, but this won?t help much if someone crashes into your car."
Conclusion	"The airbag sensor is a monitoring device whose job is to detect a crash, should the vehicle have one. In most cars, this is done by measuring acceleration, which becomes extremely high when the car hits something.Other variants use deformation sensors at strategic points on the car?s chassis. The data provided by these sensors is used by control modules to determine should the airbags be deployed. If any of them malfunction or are damaged, the airbag system will not work."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Airbag Control Module ?	"The most common symptom of a bad airbag control module is an Airbag warning light on your dashboard, and probably the only sign you will notice. The other symptom is that the airbags won?t deploy in an accident, and that?s something you definitely do not want to happen.Here?s more detailed information about the different symptoms of a bad airbag control module:1. SRS Warning LightsAirbag LightThe airbag control module is part of the Supplemental Restraint System in your vehicle. If there is a problem with this vital part, the SRS warning light will come on to alert you. However, this warning light can mean any number of things. It could also be that the sensor is bad, there?s a malfunctioning clock spring or the seat belt pretensioner isn?t operating correctly. If you have an OBDII scanner with SRS capability, you should be able to pinpoint the problem easily. 2. Airbags Don?t DeploySmall Car CrashWhenever there is a fault with the airbag system, you put yourself at risk if an accident should occur. While the SRS light might illuminate, there?s always the chance that there?s a malfunction and you might receive no alert.In this case, the only way you would know that something is wrong with the airbag system is when they don?t deploy during an accident. No one wants to find out this way, which is why it?s critical to check any trouble codes when they occur. "
Airbag Control Module Location?	"Once you figure out what?s wrong with this vital part, you want to know where the airbag control module is located. Unfortunately, it?s in a different location in every vehicle. It could be found near the front fascia, engine, front bumper or passenger seat area.The best way to find the airbag control module location is to look in your owner?s manual. Once you replace it, you might need your OBDII scanner to reset the trouble codes. "
what are the The Function of an Airbag Control Module?	"All modern vehicles contain an airbag control module to operate the vital safety system. Seat belts provide the first line of defense when an accident occurs, but the airbags are considered supplemental to be used with the seat belts.The Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) or airbag system has been installed in any vehicle manufactured after 1998. To work correctly, the system relies on numerous sensors coming from both airbags and the airbag clock spring, which is attached to the driver?s side airbag and steering column. The system also receives information from the seat belts and any other airbags that might be in the vehicle, such as the roof-mounted curtain airbags or knee airbags. All of this information is sent through the airbag control module. Other names for this part include the airbag electronic control unit or SRS control module. Basically, this part is the brain of the system, coordinating all of the SRS components for a seamless operation.The airbag control module is monitoring all of the data sent from the various sensors. It uses this information to evaluate when a crash occurs. When the airbags are needed, the module triggers the Supplemental Restraint System parts, including the appropriate airbags, to ensure the severity of the accident is lessened on occupants. The airbag control module also determines if the airbags should remain intact during an incident. Inside the airbag control module data is stored that is calculated during an event. This information includes seatbelt usage, brake use, throttle position and vehicle speed. This information can later be downloaded by a technician to evaluate what happened during an accident. "
what are the Airbag Control Module Replacement Cost ?	"The average airbag control module replacement cost is typically between $600 and $700. The labor will cost around $90 to $120, while the parts are usually priced around $510.Most people will never need to replace the airbag control module because this part is designed to last the lifetime of the vehicle. However, you should never continue driving once the SRS warning light comes on. If the airbag control module is faulty, you are putting yourself and your occupants at risk during a crash. The Supplemental Restraint System is not going to operate properly with a faulty airbag control module.If you have an OBDII scanner with SRS reading ability, you should be able to diagnose the system yourself. Additionally, you might be able to replace the airbag control module with some basic tools and know-how, thereby saving you more money on the labor costs. Once the replacement of the airbag control module is complete, you may also need your diagnostic tool to reset the codes and turn the SRS warning light off."
Conclusion	"Airbag control modules are designed to last the life of a vehicle, but unfortunately, this is not always the case due to many different factors. If you suspect your airbag control module is bad or failing, it?s important to have it checked by a professional as soon as possible."
How to Fix a Broken Seat Belt Buckle ?	"6 Steps to Fix a Broken Seat Belt Buckle1. Examine the BeltStart by examining the belt. You might not need to do anything with the belt at all. If there is something stuck on the belt, it?s possible to remove it and restore the original function. The seat belt is in a location where dirt, grime and debris can easily build up over time.If you see something stuck to the tongue, you might be able to pry it off without taking any other steps. Products such as Goo Gone work well when the substance is extra sticky. 2. Inspect the Female PartBroken Seat Belt BuckleIf there is nothing on the male part of the buckle, it?s time to look inside the mechanism. Something could have found its way into the casing and gotten stuck inside. You can take a butter knife or other object and gently stick it inside the buckle. Additionally, compressed air can be shot into the buckle to get the debris out. If the object is large, you might need to move on to the next step.You should also try some WD-40 or any other lubricant in the seat belt buckle.3. Remove the BuckleTo get a closer look, you must take the female end of the buckle off of the seat. In some cases, this simply requires you to unscrew the buckle, while other models may force you to take off the seat.You can find the directions for your vehicle in your service manual. Either way, it?s the easiest way to get inside the buckle itself.4. Open the SocketOnce the buckle is removed from the seat, you will notice a socket located between the edges. To dismantle it, you must remove all of the screws. With the edge of a screwdriver, you can pry it apart. If there are no screws to remove, you can simply pry it apart. You should be gentle while you do this. Otherwise, you could damage some of the internal components. 5. Check the Internal MovementOnce the buckle is open, you should be able to see all of the internal mechanisms. Not only will you see how the push button works, but there will also be a cam and springs. Push down on the button to see what happens next. If you notice anything blocking the movement, you should be able to remove it easily now. However, there?s also the chance that the buckle isn?t working because of old parts. While you could rebuild the buckle, we recommend moving on to the last step instead. 6. Replace the BuckleSome people enjoy tinkering around with things such as broken seat belt buckles, but the repair can be time-consuming. While there are kits out there to rebuild the seat belt, it makes more sense just to replace it.You might also consider replacing the entire seat belt since the rest of it is also probably worn. Replacement seat belt kits tend to cost between $25 and $100 for the parts. If you can put it on yourself, there?s no need to pay any additional labor, which could add $100 to $200 onto your bill. "
what are the Seat Belt Buckle?	"The buckle is part of the seat belt that releases and secures the tongue. The tongue is located at the end of the belt?s webbing material, and it fits perfectly within the buckle.When the buckle operates as it should, the tongue is held firmly in place. There should be a minimal amount of effort required to fasten or unfasten the seat belt. "
how to Fix a Seat Belt Buckle That Won?t Release ?	"The above steps were written with the assumption that the seat belt was released from the buckle. However, there are times when you might find yourself stuck in the seat belt, making it even harder to perform a repair. In this case, you will want to spray a lubricant, such as WD-40, into the seat belt buckle opening. Shake it around a little bit to let the lubricant settle inside on top of the mechanical components. After a few minutes, try pushing the button again to release the buckle.If this doesn?t work, you can always apply more lubricant and an extra dose of pressure. Once it is removed, you want to generously lube the inside of the mechanism. Put the seat belt in and out of the buckle several times to make sure it is working correctly. If the buckle hasn?t been released at this point, you only have two more options. Ideally, you will want to pull the seat belt out from the retractor far enough that you can wiggle your way out of it. Otherwise, you need to use a seatbelt cutter to free yourself from its grip. However, this option means you will need to replace the seat belt. "
What Does the SRS Light Mean?	"The supplemental restraint system (SRS) light indicates that there is a problem with the airbag system. In some vehicles, you will see the letters SRS when there is an issue, while others use a figure with an airbag.Where does the term SRS come from? When airbags were first installed in vehicles, the manufacturers thought they were a replacement for standard seat belts. However, it didn?t take long for them to recognize that they were better used in conjunction with seat belts or as a supplement. That?s where the term supplement restraint system came from.To understand how the SRS light works, you must know the various parts of the airbag system. Here are a few components that make up the airbag system in modern vehicles.Airbag module: The module or modules contain the airbag and inflator assembly. Airbag sensors: Most vehicles have multiple sensors to measure the conditions leading up to a potential collision. When an accident occurs, the sensors relay that situation to the SRS module to deploy the airbags. Clockspring: This cable allows the steering wheel to turn without causing a break in the electrical contact to the airbag module.SRS module: This computer is responsible for overseeing the airbag system.Some advanced airbag systems come with more components, but these are the basic parts installed in every modern vehicle. "
What Causes the SRS Light to Come On?	"There are quite a lot of parts that can cause the SRS light to come on. The easiest way to determine any problems with the SRS or airbag system is to use a diagnostic scan tool.Here are the most common causes of the SRS light:1. Seat Belt Latch FailureThe SRS contains sensors that monitor when the seat belts are fastened. If something has gotten into the buckle, it could be interfering with the connection. To repair the problem, clean out the seat belt buckle of foreign objects. If you don?t see anything, spray into the buckle with compressed air. 2. Defective Passenger Seat Occupancy SensorIf someone is sitting in the front seat, there is a sensor that alerts the SRS system. It not only tells the sensor that someone is there, but it also reads weight.If there is an adult in the seat, the passenger airbag will be ready to protect the occupant. However, when the sensor doesn?t work right, it can cause the SRS light to come on.3. CorrosionWater damage can quickly lead to corrosion inside your vehicle. If this occurs among the SRS components, it can spell disaster. Not only can it cause the warning light to go on, but it can also affect the functionality of the system.The only way to fix this problem is to thoroughly inspect all of the components for corrosion. Anything that is affected needs to be replaced. 4. Bad ClockspringRepair Airbag ClockspringThis electrical connector is located inside the steering wheel. Its primary function is to maintain a connection with the SRS computer, even while the wheel is turning. However, this part regularly suffers from a lot of abuse. If it stops working, the driver?s side airbag might not deploy during an accident. You will also get a warning with the SRS light alerting you to the situation. 5. Dead SRS Computer Battery BackupThe SRS computer needs a backup battery to retain the data it receives. This battery continues working even when the vehicle is off. If the battery is low on power or dead, it can cause the SRS light to go on. The only way to repair this situation is to install a new battery. 6. Previous AccidentYour SRS light might go on after an accident if the airbags do not deploy. When a collision occurs, the system is likely triggered through the crash sensors. However, if something malfunctions, causing your airbags to fail, a fault will be sent to the computer. The result is the SRS light telling you that the computer needs to be reset. 7. Faulty SRS ComputerOver time, all electrical components fail. The SRS computer is no different and is not immune to malfunctioning. Heat, excessive vibration, age and water damage can all lead to its demise.If the SRS light comes on because of a dead computer, the only repair is a replacement. "
How Do You Reset the SRS Light?	"You should never just turn off the SRS light. This doesn?t fix any of the problems; it only stops the alert from occurring. The only time you should reset the SRS light is after you repair the initial problems. With an OBDII scanner, you can erase the trouble codes and reset the light. However, not all scanners come with this capability. Before you purchase one, make sure it can read and erase SRS codes."
Can I Drive With the SRS Light On?	"No, it?s not a good idea to drive with the SRS Light on. Your vehicle will still operate with the SRS light on. However, if your SRS light is illuminated the airbag system will not function in case of an accident.We recommend getting to the service station immediately to find out what the problem is. If you have a code scanner, you might be able to read the DTCs yourself.Additionally, driving with the SRS light on could cause trouble with the insurance company. If you get into an accident and the black box recorder is looked at, the insurance provider will know that you didn?t protect the occupants, leaving you liable for the damages.  "
How Much Does It Cost To Fix The SRS Light?	"SRS light repair costs vary greatly depending on what the problem is. If your issue is something simple such as debris in the seat belt latch, you might just need some compressed air to resolve the situation. However, it could also be due to a failed airbag assembly, which could cost into thousands of dollars. The only way to know for sure is to have the codes scanned and get an estimate."
What does SRS mean?	SRS stands for supplemental restraint system. A supplemental restraint system (SRS) is an airbag or seatbelt used as an additional safety restraint to prevent or reduce injuries in the event of a crash.
Will airbags deploy if the SRS light is on?	No. In most car models the airbag will not deploy if the SRS light is on. This is considered a safety feature so that it will not be accidentally deployed if there is a problem in the system.
Can a blown fuse cause the airbag light to come on?	"A blown fuse to the airbag control module may cause the airbag light to appear, but it is not a very common problem. If your airbag light is on, the best way to determine what are wrong is to check the fault codes with an OBD2 scanner."
How do I turn off the SRS light?	"To turn off the SRS light, you must repair the problem and reset the trouble codes with a diagnostic tool. In older car models, it may be enough to disconnect the car battery. However, in modern car models, you may need to reset it with a tool."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Clock Spring ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad or failing clock spring are an airbag light on your dashboard and problems with the buttons and horn on the steering wheel. You may also notice a steering wheel symbol on your dashboard or a traction control light.Here down below is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing clock spring to look for:1. Airbag Warning LightAirbag LightEven if your car does not have a lot of fancy functions, one thing it most likely has is an airbag inside the steering wheel.The airbag is a susceptible system, and the slightest fault will light up the airbag warning light. This is because even the slightest error in the airbag system can cause them to deploy, or in the worst case, not deploy at all in case of an accident.This is why an airbag or srs light is the most common sign of a faulty clock spring, especially if the light occurred when you were turning the steering wheel.2. Steering wheel buttons don?t workSteering Wheel ButtonsIn many car models, you have a lot of buttons on the steering wheel, like the cruise control or the radio volume buttons. If you have noticed that some of these buttons or all of them stopped worked completely, there is a huge chance that something is broken inside of the clock spring unit.Try to press these buttons at the same time as you turn the steering wheel. If they work in a special position of the steering wheel, there is definitely a problem with the clock spring.3. Horn or other functions won?t workHorn CarThe horn is something you probably don?t use every day. If you want to use the horn, but no sound comes out when you push the button, it may be caused by a faulty clock spring.Also, in this situation, you can try to turn the steering wheel while holding the horn button. If you can hear an intermittent sound, you definitely have to replace the clock spring.4. Steering wheel or traction control warning lightEpc LightYou might not know that the cruise control is working together with both the traction control system and the electronic throttle control system.This also means that if the connection to the cruise control buttons in the steering wheel becomes bad, it can also cause the traction control warning light or the electronic throttle warning light to light up. To determine if it is the clock spring causing these lights to light up, you have to check the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner.5. Airbags Won?t DeployAirbags DeployIn the absolutely worst case, if you ignore the airbag light, your airbags might not deploy in case of an accident. This is, of course, something you never want to experience, but it can be the reality if you ignore the airbag light.Therefore it is super important to get the issue fixed when the airbag or srs light appears on your dashboard because as long as the airbag light is on ? your airbag will not deploy.The function of a clock springAirbag Clock SpringThe clock spring?s function is to send electronic signals from the steering wheel buttons to the control modules in the car. It is also responsible for sending the signal to the airbag in the steering wheel if an accident occurs.The clock spring is a very long wire or string twisted many times around the inside of the clock spring unit, making it able to turn the steering wheel without it getting damaged.This is also why it is essential to either reset both the steering wheel and the clock spring to the middle before installing it. If you remove the clock spring and install it in the wrong position ? you will snap it off when turning the steering wheel. This is a widespread issue."
where are the Clock Spring location ?	"The clock spring is located behind the steering wheel, often integrated with the unit where the turn signal lever is installed.To reach or even see the clock spring, you have to remove both the steering wheel and the covers around the steering wheel axle. Remember always to mark the steering wheel before you remove it to make sure you install it in the same position as before."
Can You Re-use a Clock Spring?	"After a repair, there is no problem reusing a clock spring if you removed the clock spring correctly.In most car models, you need to make sure the steering wheel is in the middle when you remove it. You should also mark the position on the steering axle compared to the steering wheel.Many clock springs have a little locking mechanism that will come out when the steering wheel is removed, and this will cause it not to rotate until you install it again. However, many clock spring models do not have this function, and in this case, it is essential not to turn it once removed.If you lost the counts of the clock spring turns, you can calculate it by turning it max to both directions and then calculate the middle, and make sure the steering wheel is positioned in the middle also."
what are the Causes of Squeaking Noise While Driving But Brakes Not Applied ?	"The squeaking noise is probably coming from the brakes, even though they aren?t applied. It could be a stone that has gotten stuck or trouble with a caliper. It?s also possible that you have rusty rotors, low-quality brakes or the dust shield is loose. Otherwise, consider an engine or transmission noise.To help you figure out what?s going on, we look at each of these problems individually. 1. Stone Stuck Between Brake Shield and RotorStone Stuck In BrakesAs you drive, it?s normal for debris to get kicked up on the road. Small pebbles and stones are one of the most common contaminants getting into the brake system. When a stone or acorn gets stuck in the brakes, it?s normal to hear a squeaking sound. If left unchecked, the debris can also cause damage to the brakes. For this reason, you want to work on fixing it right away. To avoid getting items stuck in the brakes or tires, avoid driving down dirt roads. If you have the option to travel along a paved road or something rougher, go with the smoother option. If you live down a dirt lane, you can expect this problem to occur more frequently. 2. Stuck Brake CaliperHot Brake CaliperThe brake caliper is a main component of the system. Calipers house the brake pads and are a part of the assembly. If the caliper becomes stuck, the car will have its brakes applied all of the time, which can lead to squeaking sounds. The vehicle may also pull to one side, where the caliper is stuck. If you continue driving like this, the consistent rubbing can cause the rotors to heat up. In extreme cases, a fire can start. Caliper seizing is caused by rust or a lack of use. If you leave your car sitting in storage, this problem becomes more prevalent. 3. Rusty Brake RotorsWorn And Rusty Brake RotorThe brake rotors are the discs that the pads clamp to when it?s time to stop the wheels from turning. Sometimes, surface rust appears on the rotor, which isn?t a big deal. This type of rust can be cleaned off. However, when the rust sits on the rotor, pitting and damage can occur, leading to a squeaking sound.To prevent rust from occurring, you want to drive your vehicle often. You also want high-quality rotors, which we will talk about more in a minute. When you aren?t driving your car, park in a garage away from moisture. Also, once you start driving, it?s best to step on the brakes a few times just to try and dry them out. 4. Low Quality Brake Pad or RotorBrake pads come in a variety of types. You can find value-based cheap brakes and expensive, top-of-the-line options. In most cheap vs. expensive brake pad studies, the mid-range brakes tend to be the best. Choosing a cheap type could cause squeaking, while the expensive options may not be worth the added cost.Additionally, you want to pick high-quality rotors to avoid noise. Opt for some that are zinc-plated or coated for more protection from corrosion and rust. We recommend reading through customer reviews before choosing a set of brake pads or rotors. Other customers will let you know if they are noisy. 5. Loose Brake Dust ShieldThe brake dust shield does exactly what it sounds like. It?s meant to protect the brakes from the dust that naturally occurs. By keeping the brakes covered, dust can?t harm the system as easily.Because of all of the vibration, the shield can come loose. As it rattles around, it hits the rotor, which can lead to a squeaking noise. 6. Engine NoiseCar Engine NoiseIt?s completely possible that the noise isn?t coming from the brake system at all. Maybe, you actually hear the noise from the engine area.When a belt starts to slip, or an internal failure occurs, squeaking is sure to follow. If the noise is coming from the engine, you don?t want to continue driving until you figure out what?s wrong. 7. Transmission NoiseThe transmission won?t usually make a squeaking sound. However, some noises it makes can be mistaken for a squeak. For example, if the transmission fluid gets low, it can start to whine. This is often confused with squeaking. Either way, you wouldn?t want to neglect any transmission noises either. "
How To Fix Squeaking Noise While Driving When Brakes Not Applied?	"Once you hear the squeaking noise, it?s time to take action. You can resolve a lot of future problems by fixing the issue right away. Start by referencing the factory service manual for your vehicle before getting started. Once that?s done, move on to these steps. 1. Try Driving Forward and Backward a Couple of TimesThe easiest way to fix the problem is to move the car forward and back a couple of times. If something has gotten stuck in the brakes or the wheels, this might be enough to pry it loose.If the debris remains stuck after driving around, you can attempt to remove it yourself. Just be careful that you don?t put too much force on any of the valuable components because you don?t want to cause more damage. 2. Inspect the BrakesInspect BrakesIf debris isn?t the culprit, it?s time to perform a complete inspection of the brakes. Check the calipers to see if they are seized. If so, this repair needs to be performed immediately. You also want to make sure there?s no rust or corrosion on the brake pads or rotors. If so, go ahead and replace them with a high-quality pair. 3. Inspect the Engine for NoisesOnce the other diagnostics have been done, you are ready to check the engine. Listen closely to the engine running to see where the sound is coming from. Most likely, the squeaking is coming from a belt. If that?s what you notice, you want to replace it before it breaks completely. 4. Inspect TransmissionAt the end of your inspection, you should look at the transmission. It?s not easy to find problems with the trans unless you have a lot of equipment and plenty of expertise. However, you can check the fluid. If it is low, fill it up before you run the car any further. Additionally, if it looks old or burnt, it?s time to change it. 5. Contact a ProfessionalIf the diagnosis or repair seems to be too big for you to handle, go ahead and reach out to a local professional. How do you find a reliable mechanic when needed?We always recommend choosing someone with a good reputation. Ask your friends, family and co-workers who they trust. Additionally, it?s wise to read through online reviews to see who is recommended. "
Why is my car squeaking when I drive but not when I brake?	"The problem probably has nothing to do with your brakes. There could be a stone in the brakes or the tires. It?s also possible that it?s something unrelated, such as the engine or transmission. Either way, you have to check the entire car to find the problem, so it can be repaired. "
"Why are my brakes squeaking, but my brakes are fine?"	"It?s possible that you have a stuck caliper. When the caliper seizes, it can lead to a squeaking sound. This problem also causes the car to pull to one side, whichever one has the stuck caliper. Otherwise, consider that something may be stuck in the brakes, such as a pebble or rock. "
What would cause a squealing noise while driving?	"If it?s not happening while you brake, it could still be due to the pads, rotors or dust shield. It could also be an issue with the caliper. Otherwise, consider that a stone is stuck or there?s a failure with something larger, such as the engine or transmission. The only way to know for sure is to diagnose the vehicle. "
How long can you drive with squeaking brakes?	"When brakes first start squealing, you may have a short amount of time to fix them. However, we don?t advise driving too long as the rotors can begin warping and stopping distances will be diminished. Instead, take action at the first sign of brake wear and get the problem resolved. "
Conclusion	"A squeaking noise from any part of the car is nothing to mess around with. Take this sound as an alarm, letting you know there?s something wrong with the vehicle. As top-rated mechanics, we know that a squeaking needs to be dealt with right away. It becomes a nuisance until it is resolved. When you hear the squeaking, stop as soon as it is possible and investigate where it?s coming from. If you know there?s not an emergency, you may be able to drive the car home for further diagnosis and repair. Otherwise, be prepared to park in a safe location until the squeaking can be resolved. "
Why Is My Car Making A Squeaking Noise When Driving?	"The most common reasons why a car is making a squeaking noise when driving are due to a loose belt or that something has malfunctioned in the steering system. It can also be caused by worn brake pads, tire problems, a suspension lacking lubrication and moisture in the morning. Here is a more detailed list of the possible causes of why your car is making a squeaking noise while driving.1. Loose BeltIf you have ever had a loose serpentine belt under the hood, you know how squeaky that can be. This rubber belt is needed to drive the various accessories found around the engine. If you hear the squeaking when you push on the accelerator, it means that the belt is wearing. You don?t want to drive with a worn belt because it could snap at any time. If it breaks, you risk serious engine damage that will cost you much more than a belt to fix. If you hear the squeaking sound immediately after starting the car when it is cold which fades when the engine gets hot, it is a strong sign that the serpentine belt is loose. In some car models, you can tighten the belt with the tensioner.2. Malfunctioning Steering SystemIf you notice the squeaking or whining noise when you are taking a turn, the steering could be to blame. Most often, it?s a lack of power steering fluid. It could also be contaminated. This fluid is needed to keep the steering system lubricated. As it becomes contaminated with debris and dirt, it can no longer do its job effectively. There are also steering parts that could be failing, leading to a squeaking sound. If the fluid looks good and it?s full, you might need to replace the power steering pump instead. 3. Worn Brake PadsSqueaking noises occur when you push on the brake pedal because of worn-out pads. As the wear indicator touches the rotor, squeaking will occur. This is a sign that you want to replace the pads and maybe also the rotors.However, brakes can also squeak when they aren?t worn. If you opt for cheap brakes, the material might be naturally squeaky. For this reason alone, you want to spend a little extra on a good set. 4. Tire ProblemsIt?s possible that your car tires are making the squeaking noise that?s driving you insane. If it sounds like squeaking while turning, the tires might be uneven or worn. It?s also possible that the alignment is off. However, if you hear the squeaking only when driving on a bumpy road, the issue could be loose lug nuts. 5. Suspension Lacks LubricationThere are many moving parts to the car?s suspension. At any time, these parts can lead to squeaks, especially if there is a lack of lubrication.The biggest trouble with having a squeaky suspension is finding what?s causing it. With so many parts involved, it can be difficult to hunt down the culprit. 6. MoistureSometimes, cars just squeak even though nothing is wrong. If you noticed that the grass was wet from moisture overnight, you could expect that the car is dealing with the same dew.This happens most frequently if you live in a humid climate. As you drive, the car might squeak a little as the moisture is burned away. Thankfully, it shouldn?t last long. "
How to Fix a Squeaking Car?	"1. Replace Serpentine BeltIt doesn?t cost a lot to replace a serpentine belt, but letting it go could lead to massive repair bills. On average, the belt should only cost you about $75. You may need to replace the tensioner while doing so, which could lead to higher costs.If you can get it on yourself, you can avoid the labor charges. However, some serpentine belts can be difficult to get on as some of the tensioners can be tricky to reach. 2. Fill/Replace Power Steering FluidIf the system is low on power steering fluid, a simple fill-up might be all that?s needed. If the fluid looks contaminated, it?s best to flush it out and refill it. The power steering flush only costs between $50 and $150 in most locations.If the power steering pump is defective, a new one is required. You might pay $100 to $200 for the pump itself and another $200-$300 for labor if you can?t put it on at home. 3. Check/Replace BrakesIf you hear squeaking when you apply the brakes, you might need to put on a new set of pads. What starts as squeaking will quickly turn into a grinding sound once metal makes contact with the rotors. If you need a new set of brake pads, you might spend $100 to $300 per axle for parts and labor. Having the brake rotors replaced could cost another $250 to $400 per axle. 4. Inspect TiresIf you hear squeaking, it?s always a good time to take a look at the tires. To start, you want to check all of the lug nuts and ensure they are tightened. This action doesn?t cost you any money and it ensures your on-road safety.You also want to inspect the tread of the tires. If the tread is wearing unevenly, you might need an alignment. The typical wheel alignment costs $75 to $150 per axle. However, it?s also possible that you need to get new tires installed. Expect to spend $75 to $300 per tire. 5. Lubricate SuspensionIf a squeaky suspension is causing your drive to become unbearable, you want to lubricate it. The trouble comes down to finding what are squeaking.Once you know where the squeak is, you can spray a small amount of lubricant on the part. This could be one of the most inexpensive fixes possible. "
Regular Car Maintenance Reduces Squeaking	"In many cases, you can avoid a squeaking car by simply keeping it maintained. For example, if you are having the brakes checked at regular intervals, you can replace the pads before they get too worn. By replacing the brake pads early, you also save the life of the rotors. Additionally, power steering fluid flushes should be included with your regular maintenance schedule. By flushing out the power steering fluid regularly, debris can?t build-up, so it?s always fresh. Maintenance also extends to the tires and suspension. With regular inspections, you can tell when it?s time for a wheel alignment or new tires before the squeaking begins. You can also replace worn suspension parts before they start to cause issues."
Is It Safe to Drive a Squeaky Car?	"It depends on what are causing the problems. While you might be capable of driving the car with a squeak, it might not be wise to do so. For example, if you drive with a worn serpentine belt, you risk massive engine damage if the belt snaps.Additionally, you don?t want to drive with bad brakes. As the brake pads and rotors wear, stopping distance is increased, making it more difficult to avoid an accident. The same is true if you have bad tires on the vehicle. Handling could become an issue and the tires are more susceptible to a blow-out. In most cases, it makes sense to stop driving and figure out what the squeaking is coming from. If the problem is simply moisture or something else meaningless, you will be fine to continue driving. However, if there are any car parts that need to be replaced, it?s best to get the job done sooner than late"
what are the Causes Of Grinding Noise When Braking ?	"Grinding brakes are often caused by worn out brake pads, warped rotors or if something gets stuck in the calipers. It can also be caused by broken brake pad shims, low-quality pads, or if you haven?t driven your car in a while. With a proper diagnosis, you will know how to fix the grinding.Here are the most common reasons you might hear grinding when you step on the brakes. 1. Worn Brake PadsWorn Brake PadWhen the brake pads have worn down too far, you will start to hear grinding. The pad material is made from steel, graphite, brass or copper. As this material wears down, the metal backing becomes exposed, which creates that grinding noise.However, you have warning before this sound occurs. When the brakes first go bad, they are going to make a squeaking or squealing sound. If you can replace them before it goes beyond this, you may never hear the grinding. Brake pads will last anywhere from 25,000 to 60,000 miles, depending on what type you choose. 2. Stone Stuck Between Rotor And CaliperStone In Brake RotorIf the grinding or screeching noise occurs even when you aren?t braking, it could be something more than the pads. In fact, there could be debris, such as a stone, stuck in the caliper. If left unchecked, this stone is going to create more damage to the disc brakes. In some cases, the stuck item will become dislodged on its own just from moving the vehicle. Otherwise, you can attempt to move it forward and backward to dislodge the item. 3. Broken Brake Pad Shims Against RotorBrake Pad ShimsBroken brake shims can also create a grinding sound. Worn-out shims make contact with other components of the brake system, normally the rotor. When the metal touches metal, a grinding sound is made.For this reason, when the brakes are replaced, new shims will also be installed. If they get missed, you could run into trouble. 4. Rusty or Worn Brake RotorRusty Brake RotorThe brake rotors are flat metal discs that help to slow the vehicle down when the calipers squeeze the pads together. Over time, water and dirt infiltrate the rotor and cause warping or rusting.When the brake rotors are worn, you may hear grinding. In some cases, the rotor can be resurfaced, but it may also need to be replaced. Thankfully, the rotors normally last longer than the brake pads. In general, you can expect to get 50,000 to 70,000 miles out of a set of rotors. 5. Low-Quality Brake PadsIt?s understandable that you want to save money when it comes time to buy new brake pads. Yet, in your pursuit to save money, you may actually create more problems. By choosing inferior pads, you could end up dealing with more noise than you bargained for.Cheap pads have more metal content than performance brakes. For that reason, they are more susceptible to scraping and grinding. Organic brake pads tend to be the cheapest and lowest quality. They can be made from fiberglass, fibers and Kevlar with resin. Semi-metallic brakes are a step above with better durability and less noise. However, ceramic brake pads are considered the best, but you will pay for them. 6. You Haven?t Driven Your Car In A WhileIf you don?t drive your car a lot, you may wonder why the brakes would grind. After all, you haven?t been driving enough to wear down the pads. Your problem could actually be caused by sitting still, which will lead to rust. The noise coming from the brake system will just be the start of your issues after leaving the car sit. Additionally, fluids can start leaking, flat spots can form on the tires and the battery could die. You could end up dealing with a long list of problems, which is why it?s better to drive the vehicle at least once a week. "
How To Fix A Grinding Noise When Braking ?	"It doesn?t matter how much experience you have, there are ways to figure out what?s going on with the brakes once they start grinding. We have a few simple steps for you to follow, but you should only proceed with the projects that are comfortable for you. Here are five steps to consider. 1. Determine Which Wheel It?s Coming FromThe best way to get to the heart of the issue is to figure out where the noise is coming from. If you can pinpoint where it?s coming from, you will have an easier time repairing the problem.If you are unable to tell where the noise is originating, see if you can get a friend to help. They can stand outside while you brake in the driveway. 2. Remove Wheel and Brake CaliperBy understanding where the noise is coming from, you know where to start your investigation. Pull the wheel and brake caliper for a closer look.You may be able to see what?s wrong when you pull the wheel itself. However, we advise you to dig deeper so you can get a better picture of the whole scenario. 3. Inspect Brake Pads And RotorWith the brakes exposed, you can get a much better idea of what needs to be repaired. Start by inspecting the brake pads and measure the thickness. New brake pads are going to be 3/8 to 1/2-inch thick. Once they get down to 1/4-inch, you want to replace them. However, you probably won?t hear grinding noises until the pad reaches 1/8-inch or 20 to 25% of the original thickness. Rotor inspection will be a little different. You aren?t looking for how much thickness remains but how the surface appears. The rotor surface should be smooth and without imperfections. If there is warping or damage done to the metal surface, it?s time to have them resurfaced or replaced. Both brake pads and rotors should be replaced in pairs. 4. Look For Stuck Stones Or Broken Shims Small stones and debris aren?t normally going to ruin the brake rotor. Instead, they will automatically come out of the brakes from the everyday operation as long as you can deal with the sounds. If you can?t deal with the sounds, or you are worried the stones are larger, you want to remove them yourself.Brake pads include shims that prevent noise from happening. While these should have been replaced with the new pads, they can be overlooked. For this reason, a quick inspection is good, especially if your new brakes are making noise. 5. Contact A ProfessionalIf you aren?t familiar with the brake system, you shouldn?t be poking around looking for trouble. It?s best to leave the diagnosis and repair to the professionals. You may also find that you start the investigation or repair with full confidence that you can resolve the noise but later find out that it?s above your head. There?s no shame in reaching out for help at this point either. It?s best to have the brakes taken care of properly then find yourself in a bigger jam later. "
Is It Safe To Drive If My Brakes Are Grinding?	"If your brakes make any unusual sound, you need to have it looked at right away. The brakes could fail at any time and leave you in a dangerous situation. For the cost to replace brake pads, rotors and other components, it doesn?t make sense to put yourself at risk on the road."
How Much Does It Cost To Fix Grinding Brakes?	"On average, you may spend $150 per axle to replace the brake pads. If you need new rotors, expect to spend $200 per axle. Aside from these jobs, you may also need to have service if there?s something stuck in the brakes. Either way, if you can perform the work yourself, you can save more money. "
How Long Can I Drive On Grinding Brakes?	"You shouldn?t drive on grinding brakes at all. When the pads first started to wear, you would have had a warning sign with squealing and squeaking. Once grinding occurs, metal is contacting metal, which is dangerous. Even if the grinding isn?t coming from the brake pads, there?s something wrong that needs immediate attention. "
Will Replacing Brake Pads Stop Grinding?	"If the grinding is caused by worn-out brake pads, replacing them is your only option. However, if you replace the pads and still hear grinding, you may have also needed a new set of rotors. That?s why it?s important to diagnose the issue before you authorize a repair. "
What Happens If I Don?t Fix Grinding Brakes?	"If the brake pads or rotors fail, you could find yourself without brakes when you need them the most. The grinding serves as a warning that something major is wrong with the braking system that needs your attention. By neglecting the fix, you could also cause further damage to the vital braking components. "
Conclusion	"If you hear a grinding noise when braking, you should always take it seriously. This warning sound is attempting to alert you of danger. Whether you need to have new brake pads installed, have the rotors resurfaced or get something stuck out of the system, it?s better to deal with it immediately. Otherwise, you could end up in a terrible situation when your brakes fail to work properly. With the right diagnosis, it?s not hard to resolve most brake issues quickly. If you have the right tools and some expertise, you could even perform some of the jobs in your home garage. Most home mechanics enjoy the challenge of putting a new set of brake pads on a car. However, there?s nothing wrong with getting more help when you feel the job is above your head. After all, what?s most important is that everyone remains safe on the road. "
what are the Causes of Squeaking New Brakes?	"The most common reasons why your new brakes are squeaking are excessive moisture, increased heat, or a normal break-in period. You may have also installed low-quality brake pads that are causing the noise. However, a stuck caliper or worn-out rotors can also be to blame. Here is a more detailed list of what could cause your brakes to squeak after new brake pads or rotors:1. MoistureAny type of moisture can build up on the brake pads and rotors. If there has been rain, snow or ice recently, the brake pads might just need to dry out.Even overnight condensation can accumulate on the metal parts to create surface rust. Thankfully, a few times of braking should resolve the issue. 2. Break-InIf you?ve changed the brake pads yourself, you need to allow for a break-in period. While placement is imperative to ensuring the pads are coming in contact with the rotors perfectly, you may also need to drive a few minutes.The break-in is even more important if you change the rotors at the same time. To accelerate the process, drive in an empty parking lot and brake slowly over and over again. Don?t jam on the brakes, but focus on gentle, slow stops. 3. HeatWhen new pads are installed, you are ready to push your car to its limits, but you shouldn?t. Right after a brake pad change is not the time to start towing heavy loads or climbing mountains. Additionally, riding the brake can cause too much pressure on the pads which can lead to excessive temperatures. In any of these situations, the brake pads become too hot and squeaking is bound to occur. During this time, the brakes are also less effective, so be careful.4. Low-quality Brake PadsIf you choose a new brake pad set with high metal content, you might notice some squeaking. The majority of brake pads come with some sort of metal mixture, including graphite, copper, steel and iron. Depending on the composition, you might notice squealing as the pad touches the rotor. However, there are other brake pad materials that might squeak less. You can look at organic pads that contain rubber, glass or resins, but the best option might be ceramic brake pads. 5. Stuck CaliperYour brake pads move because of the caliper pins that need to contract and release the pads from the rotors. If one caliper pin sticks, the pad could get jammed into the rotor at an angle, which would lead to squeaking noises.If you?ve changed the pads without noticing the problem, you haven?t resolved anything. Additionally, if both of the caliper pins stick, you might also notice a burning smell. 6. Worn RotorsYou may have replaced the pads but neglected to change the rotors. If the rotors are worn, there are still going to be some issues, including squeaking sounds when the rotors can?t function properly with the pads. With bad rotors, it becomes harder to stop the vehicle. It can also create a grinding sound as the metal continues to wear down. Plus, you are going to wear out brake pads faster if you run bad rotors. "
Other Brake Issues to Watch For 	"GrindingYou should never hear grinding sounds right after replacing the brake pads. Because you aren?t running metal-to-metal, squeaking is much more likely to occur. The grinding sound typically comes from the pads going below the wear indicators and making metal contact. If you hear any grinding sound after changing the brake pads, there could be an issue with the hardware. You want to have the system PulsatingIf the brake pedal starts to vibrate when you push on it, you need to look at bigger problems. It?s also possible that this symptom can combine with an illuminated brake warning light and a burning smell.In some cases, the pulsating feeling is caused by a stuck caliper. It can also create a pulling sensation on the wheel when braking. "
How to Fix New Brake Noise ?	"1. Wear Off MoistureThe repair to the brake squeaking depends on what the problem is. If there was precipitation overnight or an excessive amount of condensation, you just need to drive a little bit to get rid of the extra moisture. Once the brake pads have dried out, there should be no more squeaking. If the squeaking persists, you need to look at one of the other options. 2. Break-in PadsNew pads must also be broken in. If you have them professionally installed, the repair shop should break them in for you. However, if you replace them on your own, you want to drive around slowly and continue braking until the pads are properly seated and working smoothly with the rotors. Choose a safe location to perform this task, such as an empty parking lot.3. Cool the Pads OffIf you?ve been pushing the brakes hard, it?s possible they are just hot. You might be climbing steep inclines or towing when it happens.In this case, the best solution is to pull over and let the brakes cool down. Reducing the heat will also improve the stopping power. 4. Swap Out PadsIf you put cheap brake pads on your vehicle, you might need to perform another replacement. Sometimes, it doesn?t pay to use the cheap pads, especially when you look at how often you might need to replace them.Ceramic pads suffer from squeaking the least because of the lack of metal. On the other hand, they do cost more and aren?t ideal for heavy braking situations. 5. Repair CalipersIf you have a sticking caliper, the only solution is to lubricate it or replace it. Sticking calipers are also going to create a car that pulls to one side and possibly a burning smell.Because this situation keeps the brake pad engaged with the rotor, you are going to wear through the material much more quicker. It also creates damage to the transmission, leading to premature wear. 6. Change/Resurface RotorsIf you tried to change the pads without paying attention to the needs of the rotor, you might have to do more work to rectify the situation. When new brake pads are installed with bad rotors, the pad can?t make optimal contact with the rotor surface.Not only will more damage occur to the new brake pads, but the sound will continue until you fix it. In some cases, you will be able to resurface the rotors. However, if there?s not enough remaining space or you have a thin rotor, you will need to replace them entirely."
How to Replace Brake Pads With an Electric Parking Brake ?	"This guide will teach you how to replace the brake pads if your car has an electric parking brake. This may need some special tools to procedure depending on your car model. Follow these steps to replace your brake pads with an electric parking brake easily:Total Time: 1 hour1. Connect a car battery chargerCar Battery ChargerThe first step is to connect a car battery charger while you do this job. This is a step that many people forget or do not care about, but it can actually damage parts and cause many problems if you do not take it seriously.2. Connect a diagnostic toolCar DiagnosticThe next step is to connect your diagnostic tool or parking brake tool to your car. Make sure it got communication with the car and that the battery voltage is stable.3. Loosen the parking brake pistonsDiagnose CarNow, it is time to release the parking brake pistons. You can either do this with a diagnostic scanner, or a special tool for your parking brake. You should hear that the pistons are going back for 2-3 seconds if everything is done right.It is also possible to push back the pistons with 12v+ power and ground, but nothing I will talk about here involves doing this, because it can damage your parts. You also need to do a calibration afterward, which is difficult without a tool.If you need a tool for this, you can check out our guide: best diagnostic tools. Make sure it is compatible with your EPB system for your car model.4. Remove Caliper & Push PistonsPush Brake Caliper E1611334309761After the parking brake pistons are released, it is time to raise the car and remove your wheel and the brake caliper. You should now be able to push back the pistons with a tool or a big plier. If it is not possible, it might be very rusty and may need a renovation, or you may have done something wrong with the step before. If the parking brake motor is not released, you will never be able to push the pistons in. Remember that for some pistons, you have to twist them at the same time as you push them for them to go in.For this, you may need a tool like this from Amazon.5. Replace Brake PadsInstall Brake Pads E1611334214523Once your pistons are pushed in, you can now replace the brake pads. Ensure you lubricate any moving parts and clean everything so nothing gets stuck, or you will find yourself having to redo the job soon. Replace any metal plates if you got them in the brake pads package.6. Reinstall CaliperReinstall Brake CaliperOnce you have cleaned everything and installed the new brake pads, reinstall the brake caliper. Make sure that you tighten everything correctly according to the manufacturer?s specifications. You should also install the wheels again and lower the car.7. Push out the pistonsBrake Pedal PushOnce the car is standing on the ground and everything is put back together, jump into the car and push the brake pedal several times until it gets hard. Do not push it all the way to the bottom, though! This may damage the sealings in the brake cylinder. Pump several times instead.8. Reengage parking brake pistonsEngage Parking BrakeOnce the brake pedal feels stiff, it is now to move back the brake pistons. The best way to do this is to use the diagnostic tool or parking brake tool to do. However, in many cars, it will work to engage the parking brake with the button. You will hear the parking brake motors sound for 2-3 seconds until the parking brake is engaged. When it is engaged, you can rerelease it.9. Calibrate parking brake pistonsCar DiagnosticFor the parking brake to function properly, you may need to calibrate the pistons. This is done with your diagnostic tool or the parking brake tool. This is necessary for most car models to learn how much it should engage and release. Once you do this, you will hear the pistons move several times backward and forward until the calibration is done.10. Test the parking brake buttonTest Parking Brake ButtonOnce you have a successful calibration, it is now time to test the parking brake function. Try several times to engage and disengage it. Take your car for a drive and make sure the brakes are not getting hot. If everything seems fine, you successfully completed a parking brake pad change!Estimated Cost: 100 USD"
What happens when the electronic parking brake fails?	"Two things may happen when an electronic parking brake malfunctions, depending on what?s causing the issue. If it fails to engage, the vehicle will not be secured while parked, increasing the risk of a rollaway. This is especially dangerous when the car is sitting on an incline. On the other hand, the parking brake?s mechanism may jam or seize while engaged. If this happens, the electronic parking brake will not disengage when the driver presses the e-brake button, leaving the car?s back wheels blocked."
How do I reset my electronic parking brake?	"Many car makers have left the possibility for the driver to reset the electronic parking brake. While the procedure may differ depending on the make and model, the basic steps are usually very similar. Start by turning on the ignition, pressing the brake pedal, and shifting the transmission into neutral. Then, press and hold the e-brake button for several seconds until you hear a mechanical whining noise from the back of the car. When the whining sound stops and the e-brake light starts flashing on the dashboard, release the button. After a few seconds, press the button once again to engage the electronic parking brake."
How do you compress a brake piston with an electric parking brake?	"There are two ways of doing this, with connecting a diagnostic tool being one of them. But in most cases, an ordinary OBD2 scanner will not do the trick, as these usually can?t access the electronic parking brake?s control module. Instead, you?ll need a device compatible with your car?s EPB system. Alternatively, you could release the brake pistons by dismantling the parking brake mechanism. This method, however, requires a lot of skill and can go horribly wrong if not done correctly."
How much does it cost to repair or replace the electric parking brake?	"Repairing or replacing the electric parking brake is relatively expensive, especially compared to conventional, cable-operated versions. This is because of the complexity of these systems, which have electronic control modules and electric motors that operate the rear calipers. In most cases, even the simplest repairs will cost you more than $100."
Conclusion	"Replacing brake pads is one of the easiest maintenance tasks on a car ? or at least this was the case before car makers started fitting electronic parking brakes on their models. These button-operated devices are also semi-automated, as they apply the parking brake on their own once the car is turned off.In addition, they incorporate an uphill assistant feature, which holds the handbrake engaged when starting from a standstill on an incline. But due to their complexity, e-brakes are more prone to failures than conventional, cable-operated variants. Moreover, a suitable diagnostic tool is usually needed for replacing rear brake pads in cars with electronic parking brakes."
what are the Causes of Brake Noise ?	"The most common causes of brake noise are worn-out brake pads, defective rotors, or failing brake hardware. It?s also possible that you?ve let the car sit too long and the brakes need to be used. If there?s any dirt or debris on the brakes, they can also make strange noises when applied. Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of brake noise:1. Worn Out Brake PadsThe most common reason for brake noise is that the pads are worn out. As the material on the pad gets thinner, it?s more susceptible to making noise, especially if it reaches the wear indicators.The wear indicators are designed to make noise when the material is getting lower. With this alert, you can change the pads before further issues occur. 2. Low-Quality Brake PadsIf you?ve recently put new brake pads on but are hearing a noise, it could be due to the quality of pads you?ve chosen. Brake pads are made from different materials, some much less expensive than others.Cheap brake pads use sub-par materials that can be noisy. You could also face trouble if you opt for aftermarket brake pads that don?t hold up to OEM standards. 3. Worn RotorsIf you allow the brake pad to get too low, the metal starts contacting the metal on the rotors. Not only will this create a grinding sound when you push the brake pedal, but it can also wear the surface of the rotor.If you need to change the rotor with the pads, you are looking at spending much more. That?s why it?s important to change the brake pads at the first sign of wear. If the rotors are worn, the pads will often create an edge around the brake disc which will create a squeaking noise when braking. It may be enough to resurface this edge.4. Brake ContaminationIf you drive in a dirty or dusty environment, the brake components can become contaminated. If the contaminants are larger, such as tiny rocks, you might even hear grinding when you aren?t touching the brakes.Regular car washes can help alleviate the dirt and dust on the brake system. Sometimes, driving will help reduce the contamination as well. 5. Defective CalipersIf a caliper gets stuck or isn?t operating correctly, you could hear a grinding-type sound. This noise can occur when braking and when you aren?t trying to stop. It will also come with other symptoms, such as pulling to one side.There?s also the chance that the caliper screws aren?t properly lubricated. With any of these situations, it?s important to have it looked at right away. 6. Broken ShimsThe brake pad shim is made from a thin rubber material or metal material. It sits between the brake pad and caliper to fill the gaps that would otherwise create noise.However, when the shim wears, it can allow for movement that can cause a grinding noise. You may also hear knocking occurring when you brake at lower speeds. 7. Car Parked Too LongIf your car has been parked, you might hear some strange brake sounds when you first start driving. This issue is more likely if the car has been sitting in bad weather. Water vapor can lead to rust and corrosion of the brakes. That?s why it?s important to store your car in a garage if it won?t be driven."
Different Brake Noises	"1. SquealingWhile squealing can be annoying, it?s not normally an indication of something serious. In fact, squealing commonly occurs when the brakes become contaminated. Whether you left the car to sit for an excessive amount of time or the brakes got dirty, a little driving might be all that?s needed to end the squeal. Once the brakes are used a little, the noise should stop. 2. SqueakingThe squeak of the brakes is often the first sign of wear. As the brake pad starts to wear and make contact with the rotor, you will hear squeaking when you apply the brakes.However, squeaking can also occur if you purchase cheap brake pads. With the sub-par materials, you are more likely to hear strange brake 3. GrindingAny grinding sound should be cause for alarm. If you hear a grinding noise, you want to visit the repair shop immediately. Grinding usually occurs when the brake pad has gotten so low that it is causing metal-to-metal contact. Continuing to drive like this could cause massive damage and will inhibit the ability to stop the vehicle. "
How to Fix Brake Noise ?	"1. Drive the VehicleIf the noises occurred after having the car parked for an extended amount of time, you want to try driving for a little to see if the condition improves. This is also the case if the car was just parked during a rainstorm.In some cases, the moisture just needs to be dried off, which happens from braking. Otherwise, if there is dirt or contamination, a little braking should help to improve the pad condition. 2. Inspect Entire SystemIf the noise isn?t caused by moisture or contamination of the brakes, you want to perform a complete inspection. Check the pads, rotors, hardware and every aspect of the system to determine what?s wrong.At this time, it?s also wise to take a look at the brake fluid. While it?s unlikely this is causing your issues, you just want to make sure that the fluid is topped off and looks clean. 3. Replace Brake PadsTake a look at the brake pads to see what the condition is. If there are signs of wear on the brake pads, you want to replace them right away.Make sure you do this at the first sign of wear. Otherwise, you might be replacing the rotors as well. 4. Tighten Loose PartsIf the caliper, pads or rotor are wiggling, it?s important to tighten up the hardware for a secure fit. There might even be a missing bolt or clip that should be replaced. When hardware is to blame, you might also notice vibration with the brake noise. However, a quick replacement is all that?s needed to restore the brakes to normal function. 5. Replace Brake RotorsIf the brake rotors are damaged or too thin, it needs to be replaced. Continuing to run new brake pads on a worn rotor will only lead to the pads wearing out prematurely. In some cases, you can have the rotor resurfaced. This simple step is cheaper than replacing it and helps you get more life out of the existing equipment."
Causes Of Noise When Braking At Low Speed ?	"The most common reason for noise when braking at low speed is worn-out brake pads or pads that are a cheap, low-quality brand. The brake rotors might be worn or the shims could be broken. Noise also occurs when a stone is stuck or if the car has been parked. 1. Worn Brake PadsBrake Pad ThicknessBrake pads are made with a variety of materials, from ceramic to metallic matter, but all of them will eventually wear down. As the brake pads are engaged, the material starts to wear until they are completely gone. Noise occurs before the brakes are worn completely, so you want to pay attention.If you allow the pads to wear any more after hearing this noise, further damage could occur. The brake rotors could warp, or damage may happen to the calipers. 2. Cheap/Low-Quality Brake PadsIf you?ve just put the brake pads on and you are hearing noises, you know it?s not because the pads are worn. However, the problem could be due to the brake pads you chose to buy.Cheap, low-quality pads can make a squeaking noise right out of the box. This sound is annoying and most people will avoid buying cheap brakes for this reason. If you can deal with the sound and you need to save some money, these may still be the option for you. Just be sure to pay attention to any new sounds you hear that may indicate wear. 3. Worn Brake RotorsWorn And Rusty Brake RotorBrake rotors are circular discs connected to each wheel. When the brake pedal is pressed, the pads push into the rotor to stop the rotation of the wheel. When the rotors begin to warp, you may hear an unusual sound while braking. This sound is different from the typical squealing sound of bad brakes. Instead, it?s more of a grinding or rumbling noise. As the rotors get worse, stopping distances can increase, thereby putting the whole car in danger. You may also notice some vibration as you step on the pedal. 4. Stone Stuck Between Rotor And PadWhen no mechanical failure is the culprit, the noise could be coming from a stone or other piece of debris stuck in the system. Most often, tiny stones get stuck between the brake pad and the rotor.With this rock in place, the brakes may not work correctly. Damage can be severe if you don?t get the stone out right away, so don?t put off the repair. 5. Broken ShimsThe brake pad shim is used to prevent noise, but it can also contribute to it when there?s a problem. Brake shims keep the pads and rotors insulated from vibration. When the brake shim is damaged or taken off, vibration can occur. You will start to hear strange noises, even while braking at low speeds. 6. Parked Car For Too LongIf you put your car in storage or you haven?t used it, the metal particles on the brake pads rust to the rotors. As you first drive away, this rust is going to create a strange noise. If it?s only been a few days, you may hear a snapping noise at first, but everything should return to normal after the release. Otherwise, prolonged parking can lead to the need to change the pads and rotors before the noise stops.Additionally, any moisture can create brake noise. If it?s recently rained or you?ve been through a car wash, the brakes might sound strange until they dry off. "
How To Fix Brake Noise At Low Speed ?	"If you know a little about brakes and you have some simple tools, you can fix most noises at home. A complete inspection is required to determine the problem before you know what to repair. Here are a few steps to get you started. 1. Determine Which Wheel It?s Coming FromBefore you can figure out what to fix, you must first identify where the noise is coming from. It can be difficult to hear where this noise is originating from while you are in the cabin. If you have a friend to help you, this job is much easier. Have your friend drive around a parking lot at low speeds and brake while you listen from different angles. You should quickly be able to determine which brake or brakes are making the noise. 2. Remove the Wheel and Brake CaliperInspect BrakesTo get to the worn brake pad or rotor, you must remove the wheel. It?s also necessary to take off the brake caliper. Put the lug nuts and brake hardware in a safe location because you will need to reinstall this when the repair is done. If the brake caliper happens to be stuck, you need to repair this as well. 3. Inspect Brake Pads And RotorLook at the brake pad to see if the wear is uniform. If it?s not wearing evenly, you should change the pads. Additionally, if the pad material is less than ¬? thick, it?s time to get new pads.The brake rotors should appear smooth and uniform. If there are cracks, imperfections or any damage to the rotors, you want to have them resurfaced or replaced. 4. Look For Stuck Stones Or Broken Shims Your next step is to look for stuck stones in the brake system. Take your time to remove these carefully, so no other damage is done.Additionally, you can inspect the system for broken shims. With some cars, shims aren?t necessary for brake performance, but a lack of them can cause noise. To be sure, it?s best to replace the pads when the shims end up broken. 5. Choose Better-Quality Brake PadsIf the problem is due to buying cheap brakes, it?s best to upgrade. You can find a variety of brake pads with different materials. The more expensive brakes are going to last longer and provide a noise-free drive too.Do some research on the brake pads that fit your vehicle. You can read online reviews to see what?s best or ask your local mechanic what?s recommended. 6. Contact A ProfessionalIf you don?t feel comfortable working on your brakes, make an appointment with the local repair shop. It?s best to trust a professional with these tasks if you are unsure because the brakes are a vital safety feature.When looking for a brake professional, ask your friends and family who they trust. You don?t want to simply schedule with the cheapest shop in town just to save some money because you may find yourself disappointed in the work that?s done. "
Why are my brakes grinding at low speeds?	"In some cases, the grinding noise indicates that the brake pads are low and need to be changed. However, if the worn brake pads aren?t changed soon enough, damage can occur to the rotors, which would also lead to a grinding and growling sound while braking. "
Why do I hear a gurgling sound when I press my brake on slow speed?	"Dust can build up on the brakes, which can weaken the signal going to the ABS computer. If the computer believes that the wheel is locked up when it?s not, the ABS can activate at the wrong time. During this activation, you can hear a groaning and gurgling noise, along with pedal vibration. "
Is it normal to hear a sound when braking?	"In most cases, you shouldn?t hear a noise while braking unless the road surface is imperfect. If this is the case, the noise will go away as soon as you switch roads. Otherwise, there?s something wrong with the brake system that should be looked at right away. "
Should I stop driving if my brakes are grinding?	"You should stop driving at the first sign of brake problems. For starters, driving with bad brakes is dangerous and could lead to an accident. Secondly, putting off brake repairs can lead to larger issues, which cost you more money and create more of a hassle. "
What does a worn-out brake sound like?	"As the brake pads start to wear out, you may hear a squealing or squeaking sound. If you allow the pads to continue wearing, you will hear a grinding noise instead. This same noise can be heard when the brake rotors begin to warp, both of which should be dealt with immediately before an accident occurs."
Conclusion	"If you hear a random braking noise, there may not be anything to immediately worry about. It could be that the car was sitting for a while or that the brakes got wet. However, if the noise doesn?t go away quickly, you want to take action to figure out what?s wrong.A complete brake inspection helps you determine what needs to be fixed. The issue could be the brake pads, rotors, shims or another defect. With a quick brake repair, you can get back on the road without any more worries. "
what are the Causes of a Sticking brake caliper?	"The most common cause of a sticking brake caliper is a rusty caliper piston caused by a damaged piston boot. It can also be caused by stuck brake pads pushing on the brake discs. If it?s a rear brake caliper, it could be a faulty parking brake cable.However, some other rare things could cause a sticking brake caliper, so let?s take a look at these also. Here is a more detailed list of the seven most common causes of a sticky brake caliper:1. Rusty Caliper Pistons & Piston BootCaliper PistonThe caliper pistons are an essential part of the brake system. They push the brake pads against the brake disc to make the car reduce the speed.The brake caliper pistons have a rubber boot around them to prevent dust and other particles from coming into the brake system.It is quite common for this boot to get damaged, and water and other dust will come into the piston. This will cause the piston to start rusting, and finally, it will stop moving completely ? which will cause the brake pads to get stuck against the brake disc.Check for any damages around the caliper boot and try to lift it a little bit to see if you can see any rust.If it is rusty, you can push the piston out and clean it a little bit ? but do not forget to replace the boot, which can be difficult without the knowledge.Replacing the whole caliper is often not super expensive, and I do actually recommend it instead of renovating it.2. Rusty & Stuck Brake padsBrake Pads RustyThe second most common cause of a sticky brake caliper is actually rusty brake pads. The brake pads have their guides, which should be lubricated for the brake pads to glide forward and backward on the brake caliper bracket easily.When dust and rust get collected on these bracket slides, the brake pads will get stuck in the brake pad bracket and push at the brake disc.To fix this, you have to remove the brake pads and clean the brake pad bracket with a file or sandpaper and lubricate it with copper paste or something similar.3. Dirty Caliper Guide PinCaliper Guide PinThe brake caliper guide pins are located at the brake caliper bracket and help the caliper to slide forward and backward when you are braking.Commonly, these guide pins will get stuck by rust, which will prevent the brake caliper from functioning properly and, therefore, cause sticking brakes.These guide pins have rubber boots around them to protect them from water and dust. Check the rubber boots and remove, clean, and lubricate the guide pins again.They can be a pain to remove when they have been stuck for a while, so a torch is a must to warm them up when trying to remove them.4. Parking Brake Steel CablesRear Brake Caliper With WiringIf your sticking caliper problem comes from the vehicle?s rear, there is a big chance of a problem with the parking brake.Many modern cars do not have the handbrake inside of the brake disc but on the brake caliper. Water and other dust can come into the handbrake wires and cause them to rust.This will cause the brake calipers not to release properly when you release the handbrake.To fix this, you can try to lubricate the handbrake cable and the arm on the caliper and move it backward and forward a hundred times to see if it gets better. In the worst case, you have to replace the parking brake cables or the caliper.5. Broken brake hoseBrake HoseThe brake hose allows brake fluid to flow to the braking system and back to the master cylinder. However, if there is a small breakage in the brake hose, the brake fluid will flow to the brake pistons but not back.This will cause the calipers to stick. This is not a very common problem, but I have noticed it in some cars. If you have tried everything else and the problem still insists, you should try replacing the brake hose.6. Dirty or Old Brake FluidDirty Brake FluidDirty or old brake fluid is actually the main cause of a lot of brake problems. Brake fluid is drawing water from the air, and therefore it should be replaced every 1 or 2 years.If you are not replacing it, it will contain a lot of water, which will make your brakes rust from the inside."
How to avoid a Sticking Brake Caliper ?	"Most of these problems do not have to happen so often if you regularly take care of your brakes. There are some things you can do to avoid these kinds of problems in the future. Here are the most common ones:Changing brake fluid every 1-3rd years will prevent the brake system from rusting from the inside.Clean the brake pads, guide pins, and pistons every 2-3rd year, or at least do it properly the times you replace your brake pads or brake discs.Brake hard at high speeds sometimes. Some may think that never using the brakes on your car is a good thing, but it is the opposite. If you never use the brakes hard, they will get stuck after a while.A lot of people drive short distances and never use their brakes properly. You need to use your brake hard at high speed some times per year to prevent them from getting completely stuck.Use your parking brake even if you have an automatic transmission. Another common problem is that you never use your parking brake if you have an automatic transmission. This will cause the parking brake cables or bracket to get stuck the single time when you use it."
What?s The Difference Between Organic And Ceramic Brake Pads?	"The main difference is that ceramic brake pads last longer than organic brake pads, but organic brake pads are often cheaper. Neither of them is made for heavy towing or high-performance. In this situation, you would want metallic brake pads instead."
What are Organic Brake Pads?	"It wasn?t that long ago that brake pads were made of asbestos. This heat-absorbent material worked well for the stress that the brake pads endured. However, it was also found to be an extremely dangerous carcinogen, leading to cancer when prolonged exposure occurred. Over time, the brake pads wear down and released this dangerous substance onto the tires where it could get into the air. To resolve this problem, manufacturers started creating a safer compound for use on brake pads.The result of this shift was organic brake pads, otherwise known as non-asbestos organic brake pads (NAO). These days, organic pads are found on most vehicles in the United States. Organic brake pads contain a variety of products mixed together, such as carbon, rubber, Kevlar, fiberglass, glass and more. These products are mixed together with resin to create the modern brake pad. ProsThere are many reasons that organic brake pads are some of the most popular on the market.Create Less Dust: When compared with other types of brakes, the organic pads will create much less dust, which keeps your wheels cleaner.Low Cost: These are some of the cheapest brake pads you can choose.Create Minimal Friction and Heat: Because they aren?t performance brakes, there is less friction and heat created, making them ideal for daily commuters. Quiet: You aren?t going to hear the same amount of noise with organic brake pads as the metallic options.Don?t Stress the Rotors: With less abuse being put on the rotors, you avoid expensive braking system repairs down the road. ConsWhile all of that sounds great, there are some downsides to using organic brake pads. When compared with other styles, you will see some organic brake pad disadvantages. Some Types Can Wear Out Quicker: Because they are made of various materials, they can wear out sooner. This means you will have to perform more frequent brake pad replacement.Not Meant for Extremes: The organic brake pads are meant for a smaller temperature range, so they won?t work well in climates that are hot. Additionally, they don?t function well while towing because they overheat. Harder To Activate: With a high level of compressibility, the organic brake pads force drivers to push harder on the brake pedal for engagement. "
What are Ceramic Brake Pads?	"Ceramic brake pads are constructed from the same type of material used for plates and pottery, but the ceramic is more durable and denser. In the pads, there are also some finer copper fibers that are embedded Into the material to increase heat conductivity and friction resistance. The ceramic brake pad first entered the market during the 1980s and has been steadily gaining more popularity. ProsIt isn?t hard to see why this material is so popular, especially when looking at the pros of using ceramic brake pads. Even Quieter: If you think organic brake pads are quiet, just wait until you hear the ceramic variant. This super-quiet design is one of the top reasons people choose ceramic brake pads.Reduced Residue: Ceramic brake pads produce little to no brake dust, leaving the vehicle even cleaner than with organic brake pads.Meant for the Long Haul: Because of the construction, ceramic brake pads wear down at a slower rate. While you will spend more on this design, you will be replacing the brake pads less frequently. Requires Less Effort: With this design, owners have to push less on the brake pedal to activate the stopping power. ConsAs with all things, you will also find some disadvantages to using ceramic brake pads. Here are some of the reasons people avoid using ceramic pads.Higher Cost: Ceramic brake pads cost more to manufacture. This cost gets passed onto the consumer, making these some of the most expensive options on the market. Additional Wear and Tear: Copper and ceramic don?t absorb heat the same way that organic brake pads do. Because of this design, the heat that?s generated by the braking system will pass through the pads and affect other components. Users often experience the need for other repairs more frequently.Not Meant for Extremes: If you regularly tow, drive in extreme weather conditions or race your vehicle, the ceramic brake pad might not supply the stopping power that you need. "
Which is Better ? Ceramic or Organic Brake Pads?	"If you do a lot of urban driving and have the money to buy the best option, ceramic brakes are an ideal choice. Not only will you have to replace them less often, but they are quieter and produce less dust than the organic brake pads. On the other hand, there?s nothing wrong with using organic brake pads, especially if you are looking for a lower-cost option. The brakes are meant to provide safe stopping power and won?t break the bank.Neither the ceramic or organic brake pad is designed for heavy towing or high-performance. In these situations, you would want metallic brake pads instead. However, there are some drivers who do better picking one of these optio"
Causes of Clunking Noise When Driving Over Bumps ?	"This clunking noise is normally the result of a worn suspension part, such as a sway bar link, strut, leaf spring shackle, control arm bushings, ball joints, or a shock absorber. It can also be caused by a worn body mount or a malfunction with the steering rack. Here is a more detailed list of the most common reasons for a clunking noise when driving over bumps:1. Bad Sway Bar Links or BushingsSway Bar LinkThe most common cause of a clunking noise coming from your car when you go over bumps is due to worn sway bar links or bushings. These sway bar links have ball joints that will wear over time and cause a clunking noise.Also if the sway bar bushings that are holding the sway bar are worn, it will cause a clunking noise.2. Bad StrutsWorn StrutsStruts are responsible for dampening the bounce in the vehicle and for supporting the structure. However, the struts will eventually fail, which can cause a clunking noise when traveling over a bump. In some cases, the strut housing can also become damaged, especially after an impact. In this case, the noise might be even more pronounced. 3. Failing Shock Absorber Shock absorbers act a lot like struts, but they don?t hold the weight of the vehicle. Because this vital suspension part needs to absorb impact from the wheels, you are sure to hear clunking sounds as they fail.At first, you may only hear a slight tapping noise, which is common when a bushing gets cracked. The car also starts to bounce more when heading over a bump. 4. Worn Leaf Spring ShacklesLeaf springs are primarily used for vehicles that will be heading off-road. You might have them in your SUV or truck. Over time, the leaf springs can break or bend, leading to a clunking noise.Plus, this problem could also occur because of the leaf spring shackle. This is the component holding the leaf spring to the vehicle?s frame. 5. Damaged Control Arm BushingsEven under normal driving conditions, the control arm bushings will eventually wear out. However, if you head off-road or drive down uneven terrain, you could face this failure prematurely. Worn control arm bushings lead to misaligned wheels. Because of the poor alignment, you could hear more clunking as you head over a bump. If the issue extends into the body mount, you could also feel vibration in the cabin. 6. Bad Ball JointsWhen the ball joints fail, it becomes more difficult to properly steer the vehicle straight. Additionally, a damaged ball joint housing can create more sound when going over bumps. The housing is prone to failure if there is debris or grime buildup.Additionally, if the ball moves in and out of the housing due to excessive play, you will also hear noises. This problem commonly leads to a recognizable clunking noise, during certain road conditions. 7. Steering Rack MalfunctionThere are bushings in the steering rack that can also fail over time. If these bushings fail, you might hear a clunking or knocking noise as you head down uneven terrain or a bumpy road. There will also be excessive play in the steering rack if there?s a failure. Because of this, you could face a more difficult time keeping the car under control. 8. Worn Body MountThe body mounts are responsible for securing the vehicle frame to the body. If damage occurs to any of these mounts, you are sure to hear more noises.Not only may you hear noise, but there?s also the chance that something is misaligned. As the body mount bushings fail, you could notice more gaps or cracks in the body where everything was previously lined up correctly. However, these body mounts will almost only be found on trucks with a vehicle frame."
How to Fix Clunking Noise When Driving Over Bumps ?	"To fix a car with a clunking noise when driving over bumps, you need to inspect the sway bar links and bushings. You?ll also want to inspect struts, shocks, leaf springs, ball joints, control arm bushings, and other suspension parts.Here is a more detailed list on how to fix a clunking noise when driving over bumps:1. Diagnose/Replace Sway Bar Links and BushingsMechanic Check SuspensionThe first thing you want to do when you hear a clunking noise when going over bumps is to inspect the sway bar links and bushings. To do this, the vehicle must be on a flat surface without raising the car, then you must check the links and bushings.Do not raise the car with a floor jack, as this will cause tension in the links and bushings and you may not know if they are bad or not.2. Diagnose/Replace StrutsWhen you push down on the front and rear of your car, you can see if everything is working as it should. If there strut is damaged, it might pop as it goes up and down. You can also turn the wheels to see if there are any clunking or popping noises.A physical inspection of the strut would be your next step. If you notice oil around the housing, the strut might be leaking, requiring replacement. You also want to inspect the coil springs around the struts.3. Check/Replace Shock AbsorbersCheck the shocks for any sign of damage. You may need to lift the vehicle and use a flashlight to get a good look at the shocks. Some people prefer to try the bounce test. If you push on the vehicle and let it go, it should never bounce more than once before regulating itself. You can also examine the tire tread to see if the shocks are worn out. When shocks start to fail, the tread begins to cup. It?s best to replace the bad shocks as soon as possible to avoid this wear on the tires. 4. Diagnose/Replace Control Arm BushingsWith your flashlight, you can also check the control arm bushings. You can also perform an on-road test, as bad control arm bushings make more noise during a fast take-off or quick stop, as well as over bumps.If you notice damage to the control arms, they need to be replaced. These parts can also become bent or loose. 5. Inspect/Replace Ball JointsYou aren?t going to inspect the ball joints very similarly to the other suspension parts. You won?t be able to look for broken or damaged ball joints with the use of your flashlight.There should be a cotter pin and castle nut with the ball joints. With your pry bar, you should be able to wiggle the ball joint to check for play while the wheels are off of the ground. If there?s too much play, it?s time to replace them. 6. Check/Replace Leaf Spring ShacklesWith a flashlight, you should be able to see the leaf spring shackles and inspect them for damage. In some situations, you may need to raise the vehicle with the help of a floor jack and jack stands.If you notice any damage, bent shackles or parts that are loose, it?s time to replace them. You can also check the mounting bolts at the same time and tighten them with a wrench. 7. Diagnose/Replace Body MountYour car could have as many as eight body mounts, all of which should be inspected when the clunking noise begins. If any mount is damaged, it must be immediately replaced to ensure your vehicle remains intact and secure on the road. If you drive a unibody vehicle, these mounts aren?t present. Instead, the sound could be coming from the subframe holding the rear suspension and engine. 8. Inspect/Replace Steering Rack BushingTo inspect the steering rack, you must jack up the vehicle. Support it properly by putting the jack stands at the appropriate placement points listed in your service manual.Grab the front tire with a hand at three o?clock and the other at nine o?clock. Shake the tire side to side as someone watches the steering rack bushings. If there?s knocking in the tire or you feel strange movements, you want to replace the bushings or the steering rack. Fluid can leak from the steering rack boot, indicating replacement is needed. Thankfully, the bushings don?t usually cost too much. "
What Causes a Clunking Noise in the Front End?	"Any suspension part can fail and cause clunking, especially when you drive over road imperfections. Whether the shocks are damaged or new struts are needed, it?s important to perform a complete physical inspection and replace the defective parts immediately. "
Do Ball Joints Clunk Over Bumps?	"When the ball joints begin to fail, it?s normal to hear a clunking noise, but it normally only starts when traveling over bumps and uneven road surfaces. You could also notice a vibration of the wheel and a wandering feeling as you try to maintain control of the vehicle."
How Do I Diagnose Clunking Noise When Driving Over Bumps?	"Start by paying attention to where the sound is coming from. By understanding what part of the car the noise originates from, you will have an easier time hunting down the problem. Inspect the area with your flashlight to determine what?s defective and replace it right away. "
Is It Safe to Drive With a Clunking Noise?	"Once the clunking noise begins, any part of the suspension could be to blame. With a bad suspension, it becomes more difficult to control the vehicle, thereby putting you at risk of an accident. For this reason, and to ensure that the rest of the suspension remains intact, it?s best to replace the problem immediately. "
Conclusion	"A clunking noise when driving over bumps doesn?t need to be a nightmare to deal with. In most cases, you are looking at a defective suspension part, such as the strut, sway bar link, leaf spring shackle, control arm bushings, shock absorber or ball joints. Otherwise, there could be a body mount that?s worn or a problem with the car?s steering rack. Whatever is causing the clunking, it?s necessary to replace the defective part as soon as you can. If you are unsure what you are looking at, take your vehicle to a qualified mechanic for more support. By keeping your car?s suspension in optimal condition, you ensure not only a safe drive but also a pleasant experience, no matter what the road terrain looks like ahead. "
How Much Brake Fluid Do I Need For A Flush?	"The majority of passenger vehicles will take 32 ounces or a quart of brake fluid for a complete flush, depending on how much brake fluid you flush. To be sure, we recommend you check the service manual for all maintenance procedures and specifications. If you are only topping off the fluid, you won?t need a full quart. It?s usually recommended to change the brake fluid every two years or 30,000 miles, whichever comes first. However, if you are hard on the brakes, you may find that the fluid becomes contaminated sooner, requiring more frequent flushes. "
Are There Other Tools or Fluids Required for a Brake Fluid Flush?	"Most novice mechanics are capable of performing a brake fluid flush at home. You don?t need any special tools or advanced expertise. Here are a few tools you may want to have on hand.Wheel chocksClean ragsTurkey basterFloor jackJack standsOnce you have your gear, you are ready to flush the fluid. Follow the procedure in your factory service manual or try these steps. Park on a flat surface. Put chocks behind the wheels, so it doesn?t roll.Open the hood and locate the master cylinder. This part is filled with brake fluid.Take off the cap and put a clean rag around the outside to avoid any mess.With a turkey baster, you can get the old fluid out of the reservoir. Most of the time, this practice drains about 80% of the fluid. Fill up the reservoir with clean fluid. Make sure you have the right brake fluid type for your vehicle. Determine the proper order to bleed the calipers. If the brake cylinder is near the driver?s seat, you will start at the rear passenger seat side, move to the rear driver side brake and continue around the vehicle. The sequence always begins with the farthest wheel from the reservoir and moves in order around the car.Jack up the side of the car that requires bleeding first. Secure it on jack stands.Remove the wheel and bleed the caliper. Repeat the steps with each brake. Keep a close eye on the fluid, as it should never go below the minimum line. Once you are finished, double-check the capacity of the brake fluid reservoir and refill it if necessary.Once you?ve finished flushing the brake system, you want to take the car for a test drive. If the brakes don?t feel right, you may need to bleed them again to get any air out of the lines. "
Is Brake Fluid Flushing Really Necessary?	"Most drivers don?t think about the brake system until something is wrong. In fact, if you wait to get the brake serviced, an accident could occur. It?s estimated that nearly 300,000 accidents a year are attributed to brake failure. You don?t want to become one of these statistics. Most commonly, drivers remember to get the brake pads and rotors serviced, but the brake fluid goes neglected. Over time, moisture gets into the system, leading to rust and contamination of the fluid. That?s why you don?t want to ignore this important maintenance procedure. When the fluid is old and contaminated, it can no longer provide the lubrication and protection it needs. You end up with the decreased ability to stop on time, putting you and others at risk. Just as you would change the oil regularly, the brake fluid flush is equally important. If you don?t want to perform the brake fluid flush yourself, there are plenty of auto repair shops to help you out. Get set up on a regular maintenance schedule, not just for the brakes but all of the vital components of your car. A little prevention can keep your car running even longer. "
Can Brake Fluid and Power Steering Fluid Be Used Interchangeably?	"Hydraulic brake fluid is very different from power steering fluid. Neither of these should be put into the other system. Putting power steering fluid into the brake fluid reservoir or vice versa is sure to cause serious damage to the vehicle. If you?ve accidentally placed one or the other in the wrong system, you need to drain it immediately. Only once it is empty can you fill it back up and run your vehicle again. "
How many ounces of brake fluid do I need to bleed the brakes?	"Most automotive brake systems hold up to 32 ounces of fluid. You may not need all of this fluid to bleed the brakes, but it?s helpful to have it on hand. Just remember to purchase the right type of brake fluid for your vehicle. "
How many bottles of brake fluid do I need to bleed the brakes?	"It depends. You can purchase brake fluid in a variety of sizes. There are some that come in 12-ounce bottles for small jobs and others that are sold by the gallon for shops and mechanics. On average, the system holds 32 ounces of fluid, but you don?t always need this much to bleed the brakes. "
How many liters of brake fluid do I need to flush the brakes?	"Most brake fluid reservoirs hold up to 32 ounces. When converted to liters, that amount equals less than one liter. It?s wise to have this much on hand before attempting to perform a fluid flush. You can have this amount in multiple smaller bottles or one larger. "
Can you just change the brake fluid without bleeding?	"It?s okay to add some fresh fluid without bleeding the brakes. However, whenever you flush the system or if the air is introduced to it, you should bleed the brakes to be safe. If air infiltrates the brake system, you could lose vital stopping power, which could cause an accident. "
Conclusion	"The brake fluid flush is a common maintenance procedure recommended by the automaker. As experienced mechanics, many of us can perform this procedure in our sleep. With that said, the at-home mechanic should also be able to get it done with the right equipment and a little bit of time. Whether you can do it yourself or you need to schedule an appointment with an auto repair shop, it?s imperative that you have the flush performed. It?s necessary to protect the brake system and imperative if you want to avoid accidents. Don?t put off any recommended maintenance if you want your car to run its best. "
Can I Use Brake Fluid As Power Steering Fluid?	"No, brake fluid is very different from power steering fluid, and these shouldn?t be used interchangeably. If you put brake fluid into the power steering system or vice versa, you can cause irreparable damage to the vehicle. Both of these are only meant to be used in their respective systems.If you added brake fluid to the power steering fluid reservoir or vice versa, you will want to drain the system and refill it with the right fluid to prevent damage or accidents."
what are Power Steering Fluid?	"Power steering fluid is petroleum based. While it works as a lubricant between the metal components, it?s also needed to provide pressure transfer.This fluid helps apply the necessary pressure to the hydraulic piston. With this fluid, the wheels turn with ease as you maneuver the steering wheel. "
what are a Brake Fluid?	"Most brake fluid is glycol based. While it also provides some lubrication, it also absorbs moisture to prevent corrosion from occurring.This fluid helps to apply pressure from the brake pads to the rotors. With this action, the car can stop when you push down the brake pedal. "
Power Steering Fluid vs. Brake Fluid 	"1. CompositionPower steering fluid is petroleum based. While gasoline is also petroleum-based, these do not have the same composition.On the other hand, brake fluid is usually glycol based. You may also have heard of this ingredient based on what?s included with some antifreeze mixtures. 2. Heat ControlPower steering fluid provides a pressure transfer medium and is also a lubricant for metal-to-metal components. This fluid absorbs heat yet remains at the same viscosity for reliable performance.Brake fluid isn?t needed for lubricating parts the same way, even though it does provide some benefit. Mainly it absorbs moisture to prevent corrosion from occurring. It also dissipates the heat while remaining at the same viscosity. Because of the high boiling point, the brakes won?t fail on you or get spongy. 3. System CompatibilityPower steering fluid is needed for the dynamic steering system in your vehicle. If it is used in the brake system, it can damage the rubber parts. Brake fluid is basically a non-lubricating fluid. If used in the power steering system, the vital parts won?t get the protection needed and damage will occur."
what are the Power Steering Fluid Alternatives?	"If you are out of a power steering fluid and are in a pinch, you might be able to use an automatic transmission fluid. These two are often similar in composition and some manufacturers permit them to be used interchangeably. However, you should always check the owner?s manual before you swap any fluid for another.Vehicles don?t use as much power steering fluid as transmission fluid. For this reason alone, manufacturers put the two into different bottle sizes with differing packaging. With unique packaging, the manufacturer can advertise the fluid for a different price. "
What to do if Brake Fluid was Used for Power Steering Fluid ?	"If you put brake fluid into the power steering reservoir accidentally, you must take quick action. You can prevent major damage by following these steps.Do not turn on the vehicle or drive it. It?s important to prevent the brake fluid from circulating through the power steering system, you can prevent damage from happening. Without turning on the vehicle, all of the brake fluid that was poured in will sit in the reservoir. Open the reservoir to the power steering fluid.With a baster, start removing the fluid from the container. Make sure you place it in an appropriate container.Jack up the vehicle in the front. Secure it on jack stands.Move the steering wheel from side to side. You should see more fluid come into the reservoir.With your turkey baster, continue removing the fluid that appears. (Optional) To be on the safe side, you can also empty the whole system. Disconnect the system?s low-pressure line. Drain the fluid into an appropriate container.Continue turning the wheel so more fluid can be flushed out.Pour in some new power steering fluid and drain it back out as well. This step helps to flush out anything remaining in the system. You should repeat this step several times, just to be sure.Put the system back together.Lower the vehicle gently back to the ground.Fill up the power steering system with the appropriate fluid type.If you don?t want to work on your own car or you are nervous about draining this system properly, you should get help from a professional mechanic. However, you can?t drive it to the shop. Instead, you would need to have the car towed. A mechanic can provide a professional flush, ensuring there?s no remaining fluid in the syste"
Damage Caused by Brake Fluid in Power Steering System ?	"If the brake fluid is able to circulate through the system, you will have a much harder time getting it out. Not only will this fluid smell bad, but you will notice something different with the steering system.At first, it can cause the rubber seals to swell, leading to a leak. If left unchecked, the long-term effects can become pricey to repair. For example, if you need to replace the power steering pump, you could spend anywhere from $250 to $1,000, depending on the type of vehicle you drive. "
How to Check Power Steering Fluid ?	"1. Locate ReservoirThe first step to checking the power steering fluid is finding the appropriate reservoir. After all, your car probably has several containers filled with fluid under the hood.You can look in your owner?s manual to find its location, as each model is different. It should be a small container that?s clear and it usually contains a black cap on the top. 2. Examine DipstickIf the vehicle has a dipstick system, there will be marks on it to look at. It should remind you of an oil dipstick. Remove the cap for the dipstick and wipe it clean with a shop towel.If there?s no dipstick, you will examine the tank by the marks on the side. There should be a MAX and MIN line where the fluid should rest between.3. Double-CheckPut the cap back on so the dipstick rests back in the fluid. You want to double-check it to see what level the fluid is at. Most dipsticks contain marks that either say MAX and MIN or Full Hot and Full Cold. Either way, you want to ensure the level is located at the appropriate spot on the dipstick. 4. Fill, if NeededIf the power steering system is low, you need to top it off. Fill up the reservoir until it reaches the proper level. If the fluid looks contaminated, you might want to perform a power steering flush instead. Most manufacturers recommend performing this maintenance task every 40,000 to 80,000 miles."
Can I mix brake fluid and power steering fluid?	"No, you should not mix brake fluid and power steering fluid. Mixing or using these in the wrong system can cause serious damage to your car or even cause accidents. While both fluids are designed to lubricate and protect your car?s components, they serve different purposes and mixing the two can cause problems."
Can I use transmission fluid instead of power steering fluid?	"It depends, in many older vehicles, the transmission fluid and power steering fluid were the same. However, in modern cars you will often find that these two fluids differ from each other. Check your owner?s manual and use only a compatible fluid for your vehicle."
Can I use brake fluid for anything else?	"Brake fluid is a type of hydraulic fluid that is used in brake and clutch systems. While brake fluid is not something you can just use for anything else, it does have a few other uses beyond braking. Sometimes brake fluid can be used to clean metal parts, and brake fluid can also be used as a hydraulic fluid for other applications such as hydraulic jacks and lifting equipment."
Can I use transmission fluid as brake fluid?	"No, transmission fluid should not be used in place of brake fluid. Using transmission fluid in your brakes can cause damage to brake components and may even result in loss of brake power, which can result in a serious accident or even death."
DOT 3 vs. DOT 4 Brake Fluid Differences: Can You Mix Them?	"Dot 3 vs. Dot 4 Brake Fluid DifferencesThe main difference between the Dot 3 and Dot 4 brake fluid is the boiling point. The Dot 4 brake fluid does have both a higher wet and dry boiling point and is better suited for higher performance.Both Dot 3 and Dot 4 brake fluids are glycol-based products used in your braking system. They are hygroscopic and absorb water from the atmosphere, which means that care must be taken when storing and regularly replacing potentially contaminated fluids.Type	Wet Boiling Point	Dry Boiling Point	CompositionDOT 3	400øF/205øC	285øF/140øC	Glycol EtherDOT 4	445øF/230øC	310øF/155øC	Glycol Ether/Borate EsterDOT 5	500øF/260øC	355øF/180øC	SiliconeDOT 5.1	500øF/260øC	355øF/180øC	Glycol Ether/Borate Ester"
Can you mix Dot 3 and Dot 4 Brake Fluid?	"Yes. Dot 3 and Dot 4 brake fluid can be mixed. That?s because both of them are glycol-based brake fluids, which means that they are compatible with each other. However, if your car has Dot 4 from the factory, it?s not recommended to fill it with Dot 3; the other way around is fine. If you have Dot 3 in your car from the factory and you know that you are often driving with a trailer or in steep hills, we strongly recommend refilling it with Dot 4 instead."
Can I mix Dot 5 with Dot 3 and Dot 4?	"Dot5 is a silicone-based brake fluid. It does not absorb water from the air and is not compatible with ABS systems. It maintains its integrity and works well. It also has a higher boiling point than the brake fluids Dot3 and Dot4, making it more compatible with excessively aggressive driving.However, it is not compatible with Dot3 or Dot4 liquids and should never be mixed with them. You must also follow your manufacturer?s recommendations to know whether your braking system is compatible with Dot5 brake fluid."
What does the boiling point mean?	" Dot 3 and Dot 4 brake fluids are hygroscopic, which means that they absorb water over time. This is the reason why you should replace it every year or 2nd year.When you drive your car hard at hills or with a trailer and brake a lot, the brake fluid will heat up fast. If it is heating up too much and starts to boil, you will lose the ability to brake your car, and that is the last thing you want to happen at a hill with a trailer. Therefore, it is important that the boiling point be as high as possible.The wet boiling point is measured when the brake fluid contains water, and the dry boiling point is measured without water."
Dot3 vs. Dot4: Which one is the better brake fluid?	"Dot3 is the more popular of the two brake fluids, but Dot4 is quickly gaining popularity because it is compatible with the standard traction control and anti-lock braking system.Dot 4 has higher boiling points, making it better for all types of applications; even though it is often a little bit more expensive, it is worth getting it instead."
What happens if you use DOT 3 instead of DOT 4 brake fluid?	"While you can use DOT3 instead of DOT4 brake fluid, this is not recommended. Both of these fluids are glycol-based, meaning no damage to brake-system components will be done by switching between them.But the DOT3 brake fluid, however, has a lower boiling point than its DOT4 counterpart, which may be an issue in heavy-duty applications, such as towing or driving on steep hills. As a general rule, you should always use brake fluid with the specification that matches the one your car came from the factory with."
What happens if you use the wrong DOT brake fluid?	"This depends on which type of brake fluids you have mixed. In the case of DOT3 and DOT4, nothing dramatic will happen besides a change in the boiling point. The DOT3 has a lower boiling point, and if you?ve poured this into a DOT4-based brake system, its brakes could fade quicker under heavy loads. That?s not something you want when going downhill! In addition, both of these brake fluids are glycol-based and don?t mix with the newer DOT5 version, which is silicone-based."
How often should you change DOT 4 brake fluid?	"The DOT4 brake fluid should be replaced every two years, at least. If you use your vehicle for heavy-duty applications, such as pulling a trailer or driving up and down steep mountain roads a lot, it should ideally be replaced even more frequently. This is because the DOT4 brake fluid is hygroscopic, which means it absorbs moisture from the air. Under high loads, this moisture may evaporate and turn into steam, causing air locks that impact brakes efficiency."
How do I know which brake fluid to use?	"You can always find information about which brake fluid is recommended for your specific vehicle in the owner?s manual. Or in some cases, this may also be displayed on the brake fluid reservoir cap, which you?ll find somewhere near the brake booster. In any event, you can?t go wrong by switching from DOT3 to DOT4 fluid, as this will increase its boiling point and make the brake system more durable under high loads. Doing the other way around, however, is not recommended."
Conclusion	"Most modern cars use either a DOT3 or DOT4 brake fluid. In essence, these are similar fluids, as they both are glycol-based. The only difference is their boiling point, which is higher for DOT4.As such, the DOT4 brake fluid is more suitable for demanding applications with a lot of heavy braking, such as when towing a trailer. Neither of them, though, should be mixed with the DOT5 brake fluid, as this one is silicon-based.Due to a different chemical structure, these won?t mix well. Lastly, DOT3 and DOT4 brake fluids absorb moisture from the air, which affects their hydraulic properties. This is why they have to be replaced every two years."
what are a Brake Fluid Flush?	"During a brake fluid flush, all of the old, contaminated fluid is removed from the system. It?s replaced with fresh, clean fluid to ensure superior braking ability. The brake fluid flush is generally performed every 30,000 miles or two years, whichever comes first. It?s just as important to regularly check the brake fluid levels. If the system doesn?t have enough clean brake fluid, there can be performance issues that put your safety at risk."
Why Your Car Needs a Brake Fluid Flush ?	"The brake system contains many working components that must operate in harmony for superior performance. Whether the car has disk brakes on all four wheels or it contains drum brakes in the back, it?s still connected by tubes and hoses that link each brake to the master cylinder. As you push down on the brake pedal, the plunger pushes into the master cylinder, causing brake fluid to run through the connected hoses to the brakes at each wheel. With disk brakes, this fluid gets pushed into the caliper that applies pressure to the piston so the brake pads can grip the disk and slow down the wheels. With drum brakes, fluid gets pushed into the wheel cylinder so the shoes can apply pressure to the drum and stop movement. Either way, the fluid is necessary for braking power.Over time, components in the braking system start to deteriorate. Debris, rust, rubber, condense and other contaminants will flake away and end up in the brake fluid. As the fluid becomes dirty, it?s less able to perform its job, leaving you with brakes that don?t work properly. Additionally, brake fluid is considered hygroscopic. It absorbs moisture and becomes less effective the older it becomes. Plus, the metal components don?t hold up well against this moisture and can easily corrode."
what are the Brake Fluid Flush Cost ?	"The average brake fluid flush cost is typically $75 to $250. The price includes both parts and labor. If you complete the brake fluid flush yourself, you could save some money.Additionally, the cost varies based on your location and the labor costs in the region. It can also depend upon the make, model and year of your vehicle. "
what are the Signs Your Car Needs a Brake Fluid Flush ?	"1. MileageThere?s plenty of debate over how often a brake fluid flush should be performed, but most car manufacturers will outline the recommendation in the service manual. If you are unsure, it?s best to follow the 30,000-mile or 2-year standard.The regular maintenance schedule relies heavily on your driving style. If you are commuting in the city where lots of braking is involved, you might need more regular flushes than the person driving on the highway each day. 2. Spongy Brake PedalIf the brake pedal starts to feel spongy or loose when you push it, now is a good time to change the fluid. If you leave the problem unchecked, the pedal could start going all the way down to the floor, which is very dangerous.As the fluid becomes lower and contaminated, air can infiltrate the system. What you are left with are brakes that don?t respond the way they should. 3. ABS LightThe anti-lock brake system helps keep your wheels from locking up when traction is lost. There?s an ABS warning light on the dashboard that indicates when there?s a problem with the system.If the brake fluid becomes low or heavily contaminated, the ABS light might come on. The system will also shut off to compensate for the lack of braking power. 4. Reduced Braking PerformanceIn normal circumstances, the brakes are going to operate quickly and efficiently. There should be no delays when you push the brake pedal down to stop. If there is, you might need a brake fluid flush.However, performance issues can also be related to worn-out brake pads, warped rotors or wear of another component. If you are unsure, it?s best to have someone perform a brake system inspection. 5. Noises/SmellsWhenever there?s an issue with the brake system, it can be caused by a worn component or low brake fluid. It?s possible to even deal with grinding or scraping, although these normally point to worn-out parts.If you notice burning odors when braking, there could also be burnt fluid from contaminants. However, the presence of burning should always cause you to stop driving and determine the cause to ensure your safety. "
How to Perform Brake Fluid Flush ?	"1. Empty Old Brake FluidYou need to drain out all of the old fluid from the master cylinder. There?s no drain plug to the system, so you will need to use a siphon pump or transfer pump.If all else fails, you can use a larger syringe or turkey baster. Keep removing the fluid until the reservoir is empty. Perform this step with the engine off and the car in Park. Also, make sure there is no pressure on the brake pedal. 2. Fill the System & BleedFill up the reservoir with fresh brake fluid. You will bleed the system the same way you do when you install new brake calipers.Begin at the back of the car and bleed the two rear calipers or wheel cylinders. Push down the brake pedal and open the corresponding bleeder screw. When the pedal reaches the floor, close the bleeder screw and release the pedal. Continue this process until all of the air has been removed from the system.Once the back brakes are done, you are ready to move to the front. Perform the same steps on the front brakes.3. Top Off & TestAfter you bleed each wheel, you must check the master cylinder reservoir to see if more fluid should be added. Additionally, you must top off the system once you are finished bleeding the brakes. Before you head out on the open road, take a short test drive of your vehicle. It?s best to find an empty parking lot or somewhere uninhabited to test the brakes out before using them in the real world. "
what are the Brake Fluid Leak Symptoms ?	"The main symptoms of a brake fluid leak include:Squishy Brake PedalNo Pressure in the Brake PedalPoor Braking PerformanceVisible Fluid LeakBrake Warning LightWhile these are the most common signs, it?s not all of them! Here down below is a more detailed list of the signs of a brake fluid leak to look for:1. Squishy Brake PedalBrake PedalAny time there?s air in the system, you?re going to have a brake pedal that feels squishy. When you have a brake fluid leak, you?re not just losing brake fluid every time you press the brakes, but you?re also sucking in air every time you let off the pedal.If you?re pressing the brakes and it doesn?t feel right, don?t ignore it and hope it goes away. Figure out what?s going on and make the necessary repairs straight away.2. No Pressure in the Brake PedalPush Brake PedalWhen you press the brake pedal, you should feel something ? if it sinks straight to the floor, you have a problem. While several conditions could cause this, if it worked fine the last time you got in your vehicle, chances are you have a massive brake fluid leak.Whatever you do, don?t drive your vehicle. If you don?t feel any pressure when you hit the brake pedal, you currently don?t have any brakes ? which means you won?t be able to stop as your driving.3. Poor Braking PerformanceLonger Brake DistanceThis might be the first thing that you notice if you have a brake fluid leak. When you hit the brakes, you expect to stop after a certain distance. But when your brake system has a leak, you?re not getting maximum braking pressure ? some of that pressure is escaping out through the leak.Moreover, you?re getting air and moisture in the system, which is negatively impacting your braking performance too. Add it all up, and you get a dangerous condition where your vehicle can?t stop like you?re expecting it to.4. Visible Fluid LeakCar Fluid LeakIf your vehicle has a leak, that means that fluid is going somewhere, right? If you have a brake fluid leak, you have a visible leak somewhere. The problem that brakes fluid leaks are incredibly hard to find. The fluid itself is mostly transparent, and there?s not that much brake fluid in the system to begin with.It?s not like oil or coolant leaks that you?ll likely notice by simply looking underneath your vehicle. You usually have to look for brake fluid leaks, but if you find one, you have a big problem you need to address right away.5. Brake Warning LightBrake Warning LightWhile you might expect that the brake warning light would pop on any time, you have a brake fluid leak, and the sad truth is that it doesn?t always work that way.The brake warning light will show up when the level in the brake fluid reservoir is too low. Remember that not all car models have this feature though, and if you have a big leak, you will have problems before the fluid goes low.But even small brake fluid leaks mean big problems, so you can?t rely solely on your brake warning light to keep you safe."
How to Diagnose a Brake Fluid Leak ?	"The best way to diagnose a brake fluid leak is through a visual inspection. You should start with the reservoir before inspecting the remaining components.While the brake fluid system is sealed, that doesn?t mean that anytime you see the fluid level in the reservoir drop, you have a problem. That?s because as the pistons in the brake calipers expand, the overall brake fluid level will drop too.But this drop should be gradual ? and you should always have some brake fluid there. Because of this, monitoring the brake fluid level is one of the best ways to make sure your vehicle doesn?t have a leak. If you know how quickly the brake fluid should drop, you?ll have a better idea of what an abnormal drop looks like.From there, the next best thing you can do is complete a visual inspection of all the brake components. This means everything from the master cylinder to the calipers at each wheel. You might need to jack up your vehicle to trace all the brake lines, but it?s worth it.If you have a brake leak, you will see it. Just make sure to check when your vehicle is dry and pump the brakes a few times before you start."
Repair Costs to Fix a Brake Fluid Leak ?	"The average brake fluid leak repair cost is between $150 and $1,000. While that?s a vast range, it?s because there is a wide array of causes of a brake fluid leak.For instance, the cost to replace a brake line ranges anywhere from $150 to $200, while the cost to replace a brake booster can cost you anywhere from $600 to $800.Complicating the matter, even more, there?s no one cause that?s significantly more common than the rest. If you dive in an area with lots of salt on the road or by the coast with lots of salt in the air, you might experience rusted brake lines more frequently, but other drivers might find that they need to replace the master cylinder more often.Finally, because some jobs are easier to complete than others, you may or may not be able to rule out the labor costs. As an example, if you need to replace a brake line and can?t find the OEM replacement, the repair shop may need to make it. You likely don?t have the tools for this, even if you have the necessary expertise."
Can you drive with a brake fluid leak?	"No, you should never drive with a brake fluid leak, not even a small one. A brake fluid leak can result in the complete loss of your car?s braking ability, which is life-threatening for both you and other people on the road."
How do you stop a brake fluid leak?	"To stop a brake fluid leak, you need to replace or fix the leaking part. There is no anti-leakage additive you should use for the brakes. All work on the car?s hydraulic brake system should be carried out by a professional to prevent accidents."
Will brakes still work without fluid?	"No, without brake fluid, your brakes will not work. Brake fluid is essential for the operation of your brakes. It provides the necessary pressure to activate the brake pads and calipers, which in turn stops your car. If you don?t have any brake fluid in your system, your brakes will not be able to function properly."
Can you mix old and new brake fluid?	"If you only fill up your brake fluid, it is perfectly fine to mix old and new brake fluid. It is definitely better to replace the brake fluid completely, but in many cases it is not necessary. Just make sure you use brake fluid with the correct specifications for your car."
How to Check Automatic Transmission Fluid ?	"To check the transmission fluid, you should first park the car at level ground with the engine running. Locate the dipstick and pull it out. At first glance, you should be able to examine its overall condition. Wipe the stick clean with a rag and put it back in. Now, pull it back out to determine how much fluid is in the system based on the lines of the dipstick.Here is a more detailed list of how to check the automatic transmission fluid:1. Park the car on level groundBefore you get started, park the car on level ground. You want the gearshift in Park and the engine running. However, you don?t want the engine to be hot. It?s best if it?s only slightly warmed up.Make sure the parking brake and parking are engaged to prevent accidents.2. Locate the DipstickTransmission Fluid DipstickFind the appropriate dipstick. There will be a couple under the hood in most cars, with one for the oil level and another for transmission fluid. Check the owner?s manual if you are having trouble locating it. If you don?t find the dipstick, it?s possible that your vehicle doesn?t have one. We cover that situation more in a little bit. 3. Check ConditionPull out the dipstick and take an initial evaluation of the fluid. You aren?t going to be too worried about the level yet.However, while it is out, you can clean the fluid off of the dipstick with a shop rag or lint-free towel. Evaluate the color and smell to ensure it?s in good condition. 4. Recheck the Dipstick LevelWith the dipstick wiped clean, put it back in the tube. Pull the dipstick back out and check how full the system is. You want the transmission fluid line to hit the Full mark on the dipstick. If it needs more, add the appropriate automatic transmission fluid, but don?t overfill it. "
How to Evaluate Transmission Fluid ?	"1. ColorWhen transmission fluid is new, it?s normally bright and red. It should also be transparent. If the transmission fluid starts to look brownish or a darker red, it might not be new anymore. These darker colors reveal contamination of the fluid. It would be wise to change the fluid at this point. If you see black transmission fluid, you are in a worse situation. The fluid has become burnt, likely due to some kind of transmission issues. You should see a transmission specialist to figure out what?s going on. 2. SmellTransmission fluid can have a quite strong smell, but it shouldn?t smell burnt.If the fluid smells like burnt toast, you should be alarmed. This burnt smell means that the transmission is suffering from issues. It?s probably also black-colored, as discussed above. 3. ConsistencyIt?s natural for automatic transmission fluid to appear a little thicker than when it was new. This shouldn?t cause you to worry at all. The closer to new fluid it looks like, the better the condition is.You should still be able to see through the fluid, showing that there are no particles inside. If you see particles or contaminants, you need to look closer. Any metal shavings in the fluid could indicate possible transmission failure. Additionally, if the liquid has become foamy, you might have used the wrong type or the transmission has been overheating. Either way, you want to take quick steps to correct the problem before it becomes worse."
How Often Should You Check Transmission Fluid?	"When it comes to checking car fluid levels, it?s best to have a monthly appointment to give everything a quick glance. You can pull the transmission dipstick, check the oil, fill up the windshield washer fluid and evaluate tire pressures. With all of these tasks together, you ensure that problems are caught early, so permanent damage is less likely.However, there are times when more frequent checks are recommended. If you are hard on your vehicle, such as regularly towing or hauling heavy equipment, you might want to check the fluid level weekly. You should also check it more often if you drive in severe climates, such as dusty and sandy environments. Aside from checking the transmission fluid, regular maintenance is also important. Every manufacturer sets a maintenance schedule that you should follow. The guidelines will be outlined in your owner?s manual. However, the recommendation is usually to have the transmission fluid changed every 30,000 to 60,000 miles. You might also consider a transmission fluid flush every 90,000 miles.Many newer vehicles have intervals set at 100,000 miles or more before the first automatic transmission fluid change. However, this interval seems to alarm most professional mechanics, so you must use your own discernment about what?s best for your model. "
What if There?s No Transmission Fluid Dipstick?	"Modern vehicles are now being built with sealed transmissions. These high-end transmissions don?t come with a dipstick because some of them are hailed as being maintenance-free. According to the manufacturers, you will never need to perform maintenance on the transmission, so there?s no reason for the dipstick. However, there are also vehicles with sealed transmissions but with an electronic level sensor instead of a dipstick.If you suspect your automatic transmission has an electronic transmission level sensor, check your owner?s manual for the correct procedure for finding the transmission fluid level."
Cost to Change Automatic Transmission Fluid ?	"If you can change the transmission fluid yourself, you may only spend an average of $50. The most important consideration is to purchase the right transmission fluid for your vehicle, as there are different kinds. If you don?t feel skilled enough to change the transmission fluid yourself, you must take your vehicle to a professional shop. At this shop, you might spend $50 to $250 on the fluid change. The price depends on what type of vehicle you drive, how much fluid is needed and where the shop is located. If you go to an independent lube shop, you will spend the least, but the mechanics aren?t usually factory-trained. On the other hand, you will spend more to visit a dealership or specialized transmission shop, but the experts have more knowledge of the vehicle, thereby offering some additional peace of mind."
Do I check automatic transmission fluid with the car running?	"Yes, in most car models you should check the automatic transmission fluid level with the car engine running. If you check it with the engine off, it will show you a much higher level. Check your owner?s manual for the correct procedure in your car model."
Do I check automatic transmission fluid hot or cold?	"It is best to check the automatic transmission fluid level when the fluid is warm in most car models. However, it depends on the car model, so it is better to check your owner?s manual. In many vehicles, you should check the transmission oil at a specific fluid temperature, but it can be difficult to determine without the right diagnostic tools."
How long do you let the car run before checking the transmission fluid?	"You should let your car engine run for 5 to 10 minutes before checking the transmission fluid. This will ensure that the fluid is not too hot or too cold. However, check your owner?s manual for the correct procedure for your car model."
Do you leave the car running when adding transmission fluid?	"Yes, it?s a good idea to top up the transmission fluid with the engine running, as this will pump the new transmission fluid around. However you can also fill it with the engine off, but you still need to let the fluid run in the system for a while before checking the fluid level again."
What Does The ESC Light Mean?	"The ESC Light indicates that there is a problem with your car?s electric stability control system. This system works hand in hand with your vehicle?s traction control system to help you control your vehicle in dangerous conditions.But while stability control and traction control are often referred to together, they are not the same system. Stability offers additional features than traction control, including those that can help you in an understeer or oversteer situation.So, while an electronic stability control system will always incorporate traction control, not every vehicle with traction control has stability control.Electric Stability Control (ESC) Light FunctionEsc LightThe ESC light is there to alert you when there is a problem in the electronic stability control circuit, or to tell you that your stability control system is currently in use. When this happens, it either means that there?s a problem somewhere in the system, or everything is working as it should, and it?s keeping you from skidding across the road.If it is working as it should, you?re going to notice. You?ll feel your vehicle applying the brakes to individual wheels, and the light is going to flash on and off, but it won?t stay on. If there?s a problem in the system, the light will stay on, and you?re not likely to notice anything ? although it?s possible the system could kick on at any point depending on the fault.Some type of electronic stability control is required for all modern vehicles, however the type of ESC system the car uses depends on the car manufacturer."
ESC Light Causes?	"The most common cause of an ESC light is either that the system is turned off by mistake or a faulty wheel speed sensor. It can also be caused by a bad steering angle sensor or a wiring issue.But while those are the most common causes of an ESC light, they?re not the only things you need to look out for. Below, we have highlighted the four most common reasons why your vehicle?s ESC light may be on.1. System Is Turned OffTraction Control OffDid you know that in most vehicles, you can turn the stability control system off? While you don?t want to do this unless you?re trying to drift, it is something you can do. And when you turn the ESC system off, the ESC light turns on.Before you take your vehicle to the repair shop, look up how to turn the system on and off and give it a try. You?d be surprised how many times this fixes the problem and prevents unnecessary headaches.2. Faulty Wheel Speed SensorsAbs SensorIf there is a problem within the system, it almost always comes down to a faulty wheel speed sensor. Your vehicle?s ESC system works by monitoring each wheel speed sensor, and then adjusting the brakes to fit any discrepancies that it notices.But if one of the wheel speed sensors is completely offline or giving errant readings, then your ESC system will have problems. Verify that each wheel speed sensor is working correctly by hooking up a scan tool and monitoring each sensor?s speed readings while driving.3. Faulty Steering Angle SensorSteering Angle SensorAnother sensor that controls your ESC system is the steering angle sensor. This sensor works in tandem with the wheel speed sensors to ensure that each wheel is spinning at an appropriate speed according to the direction you?re going.That?s because as you turn, the outside wheels are going to spin faster than the inside wheels. This is completely normal, but without the steering angle sensor telling the ECM what?s happening, it?s going to look like one side of your wheels is slipping while the other side has perfect traction.4. Faulty Wiring/Electrical ProblemsThe sensors themselves might be working perfectly fine, but if there?s a break in the wiring between the sensor and the ECM, nothing is going to work correctly. While this is a little more on the rare side, it can happen, especially near the wheel speed sensors where the wiring is exposed.Finally, always verify the power and the battery when checking these sensors. I once spent half a day troubleshooting an ESC system that errantly kicked on at high speeds only to discover the problem was a battery with a dead cell.The vehicle still started, but it kicked up issues in the ESC system. To this day, I still don?t know how or why it happened ? but double-check the battery."
Is It Safe To Drive With an ESC Light?	"It is not safe to drive with an ESC light on. But just because your ESC light turns on while you?re driving doesn?t necessarily mean that you have a problem. If the light kicked on and off while driving on slippery roads or while you were skidding, then everything was working the way it should, and you don?t need to worry about a thing.However, if your ESC light is turning on when it shouldn?t or is staying on all the time (when you haven?t turned the system off), this is not a safe condition to be driving in.That?s because your ESC system regains stability by turning on your ABS and applying the brakes to individual tires ? which means while you?re driving down the road, your brakes can start pumping on and off ? even if you?re heading 80 miles per hour down the highway.So, while you likely won?t run into any problem while driving if you have an ESC light on, the first time it acts up could wind up causing a serious accident."
Conclusion	"If the ESC light is showing on your dashboard, it usually indicates that there is an issue with your car?s electronic stability control system. It is usually showing up together with a traction control light or an ABS light.While there are plenty of things to love about modern technology, it can be tempting to curse at it when things start acting up. But don?t write off the ESC system completely. While it can be a little frustrating when things aren?t working the way they should, it?s a potentially life-saving innovation when you need it most.The few problems they occasionally cause are well worth it, considering the thousands of accidents they?ve prevented."
At What Thickness Do Brake Pads Need To Be Replaced?	"Brake pads are considered to be moderately worn when they reach 4 to 6 millimeters (1/8 to 1/4 inch) thick. Once the brake pads get lower than this, between 2 and 3 millimeters (below 1/8-inch), they should be replaced immediately. However, your car is no longer safe to drive once the brake pads get this thin. You should stop driving until you get new brake pads installed. If you continue to drive even though the pads are this thin, you risk ruining the rotors. The metal-to-metal contact can also create a grinding sound that?s tough to bear. "
At What Thickness Do Brake Pads Start At?	"When you get new brake pads, they may measure around 12 millimeters (1/2 inch) thick. However, some cars have thinner brake pads in the rear, often measuring eight to ten millimeters thick. Brake pads can retain this level of thickness for a good amount of time. If you are careful with how hard you break and you don?t make sudden stops, it will take much longer for the pads to wear down. Ideal Brake Pad ThicknessIt?s always best to have brake pads measuring six millimeters or more. Once they get below this point, they won?t perform as well. If you are tight for money, you may be able to get a little more life out of them, but you don?t want to prolong the replacement too long. By the time the brake pads reach three millimeters thick, you are in danger. Safety becomes a concern and further damage can occur to other brake system components. "
what are The Legal Minimum Brake Pad Thickness?	"According to the federal government, the brake pads on the steering axle should never get lower than 1.6 millimeters with the hydraulic disc, drum or electric brakes. With air disc brakes, the requirement is 3.2 millimeters as a minimum. What these measurements don?t take into account is that neither of these terms are ideal. By the time the brakes get this low, on-road safety is seriously compromised. That?s why it?s never wise to wait this long to change the brake pads. "
Do Some Brake Pads Last Longer Than Others?	"As with all automotive parts, you have a range of products to choose from. If you are on a budget, you can find cheap brake pads. On the other hand, if you are looking for a premium set of pads, they are available too. In almost all cases, you are going to get what you pay for. The low-cost brake pads are constructed from cheap materials. They won?t dissipate the thermal energy as well, so they don?t last as long. On the other hand, you are paying more for performance brakes, but they handle the heat better for slower wear and increased braking ability. Here are the three main types of brakes you could be looking at.Organic: These inexpensive brakes are quite soft. They may be the least expensive, but will also wear out faster than any other kind.Semi-metallic: These brakes are harder than the previous option because there is more durable material included. You get better stopping power and still pay a reasonable cost.Ceramic: These are going to manage the heat better than both organic and semi-metallic. The durable material will offer the best resistance to heat, but you are going to pay much more for them. Ideally, you will choose brake pads that are ceramic if you want more efficiency. With these, you may need to spend more to get a good pair of rotors too. With that said, not every car benefits from high-end brakes. For example, if you have a small hatchback, it?s unlikely that you need performance brakes.Beyond the type, you can be smart about which brand you choose. There?s no reason to purchase the most expensive brand if it?s not what you need. There are plenty of high-quality brake pads for a reasonable cost. "
How Often Should I Check Brake Pad Thickness?	"Checking the brake pads should be part of your regular car maintenance schedule. If you take your vehicle to the shop for maintenance, the technicians would probably check the pads every time. However, if you are handling all of this on your own, you would want to look at the pad thickness every 5,000 miles or twice a year. Brake pads should last far longer than 5,000 miles, but it?s good to keep an eye on the thickness, so you aren?t caught by surprise. Most brake pads are designed to last between 25,000 to 75,000 miles. Rotors can normally go even longer when properly cared for.In addition to checking the pads at regular intervals, we also recommend taking a peek if you notice any signs of wear. A few of the most common signs of brake pad wear include:Squealing noise when brakingGrinding during braking or drivingLonger stopping distancesPulling to one side while brakingVibrations coming from the brake pedal when it?s pushedIf you check the brake pads after noticing these symptoms and don?t see anything wrong, you might want to take the car to the shop. There could be a larger problem occurring within the brake system. "
How to Measure Brake Pad Thickness ?	"If you want to know how thick your car?s brake pads are, you can measure them at home. You can also check the brake pads without removing the wheels on many cars, depending on the car model and the rim type. However, here?s how to do it the proper way. All you need is a floor jack, flashlight, lug wrench and brake measuring gauge. Here are the steps to follow to check the brake pad thickness.Park on level ground and place chocks behind the wheels that will sit on the ground.Use your floor jack to elevate the side of your car where you will check the pads. You can find good jack position points outlined in your service manual.With your lug wrench, loosen up the bolts on the wheel. Carefully take them off and place them in a secure location. Take the wheel off of the car, so the brake rotor and caliper are exposed. Look through the hole in the caliper. You should see the inside or inboard pad and the outer or outboard pad. If they are difficult to see, use a flashlight. With your brake measuring gauge, measure the thickness of the pads. If you don?t have this gauge, you can also use a compass or Vernier caliper. Read the measurement from the tool. This shows you how thick the pad is.Working reverse order, put the wheel back in place and slowly lower your vehicle back to the ground. If you have trouble getting the measurements or you need more help, you can reach out to your local auto repair shop. Many shops will offer brake pad inspections for a reasonable price if you get the work done with them. "
How to Prolong Brake Pad Life ?	"The life of the brake pads has a lot to do with how you drive. If you don?t consider your road habits, you could be wearing through more brakes than you need to. For that reason, we?ve put together a few tips to consider.Slow down. If you are speeding, you will have to push down even harder with the pads to get the car stopped.Coast as much as possible. Instead of accelerating and decelerating frequently, consider coasting when possible. Drive with one foot. Don?t let your left foot rest on the brake. In this position, it?s too easy to ride the brakes without even knowing it. Keep your distance. Don?t follow other cars too closely. By staying back, you give more time for reaction and you won?t need to brake as often.Remove excess weight. Take anything out of the car that you don?t need. Every additional pound is more work on the brakes when it?s time to stop.Additionally, it?s critical that you follow through on all brake maintenance schedules. Find out when the automaker recommends service and get it done. "
Is 4 mm Brake Pads OK?	"Once the brake pads go lower than four mm, they are considered to be in the danger zone. At this point, it would be best to have the brake pads changed to ensure your on-road safety. Any lower than this could lead to wear of the rotors as metal starts to contact metal. "
How Long Will 3mm Brake Pads Last?	"Any decent mechanic is going to tell you to change your brake pads if they measure three millimeters. There?s no reason to see how much longer they could last because failure is possible at any time. To ensure maximum stopping power, it?s best to change them now. "
How Thin Is Too Thin On Brake Pads?	"Once the brake pads go below six millimeters, they are considered halfway worn. You can get a little more life out of them, but would ideally change them before hitting three millimeters thick. If they are measuring two or three millimeters, there?s no more time to wait. "
How Many mm Is Bad Brake Pads?	"Once the brake pads go below six millimeters, they are considered halfway worn. You can get a little more life out of them, but would ideally change them before hitting three millimeters thick. If they are measuring two or three millimeters, there?s no more time to wait. "
Can Brake Pad Thickness Be Measured Without Removing The Wheel?	"If you don?t want to pull the wheels, you may be able to look through the holes to examine the brake pad thickness. While you can?t measure them, you can get a feel for how much is left. Plus, you can look for a wear indicator tab that?s on the side of the pad. If it?s touching the rotor or broken, you might need new pads. "
Conclusion	"New brake pads measure between 8 and 12 mm thick. Through six millimeters, the brake pads are considered to be in good condition. Once the pads reach four to six millimeters, moderate wear has occurred and you should start to consider a replacement. Beyond this, two to three millimeters is dangerous.Learning how to measure your own brake pads can help you take control of your maintenance. There?s no reason to put yourself at risk when you know when it?s time to get new pads installed. "
what are the Causes of Spongy or Soft Brake Pedal ?	"A spongy brake pedal occurs when there?s air in the lines or a line is broken. The problem could also occur if the brake shoes need adjustment. Otherwise, a mechanical failure might have occurred, such as worn calipers, a bad master cylinder, failing wheel cylinders or a malfunction with the ABS Hydraulic assembly. Here is more detailed information on the most common causes of a spongy or soft brake pedal:1. Air in Brake LinesBleed BrakesThe brake system should remain closed, meaning no air should get inside. However, air can get trapped in the brake lines, especially after service. This problem causes a spongy pedal and it keeps the fluid from circulating as it should.If the fluid hasn?t been changed, now might be a good time to do that. If service was just performed, you might need to bleed and flush the brake system to get rid of the air. Ensuring the system has clean fluid is important to keeping all of the parts lubricated and the brakes responding as they should. 2. Broken Brake LinesBrake Fluid LeakOne reason air might have gotten into the system is because of a damaged line. Brake lines are constructed from steel tubing that are susceptible to wear and rust. If the rust or corrosion leads to a small hole forming, brake fluid will start to leak out. As fluid leaks out and air infiltrates the system, hydraulic pressure is lost, leading to a spongy pedal. 3. Brake Shoes Need AdjustmentSymptoms Of Bad Or Worn Brake ShoesIf your vehicle contains brake drums and shoes, you may need to adjust them. As they wear, it?s normal for some adjustments to be needed, which is why you want to stay on top of maintenance.You should also apply the parking brake occasionally. This simple step helps to keep the rear brake shoes engaged and adjusted. 4. Worn CalipersBrake CaliperBrake calipers are the component meant to clamp the pads against the rotors on the disc system. Over time, they can become corroded. When rust occurs on the internal piston seal, leaking can occur.If the brake caliper is leaking, the pedal can become spongy and even go to the floor. You don?t always need to change the caliper if the seal can be replaced and resolve the issue. 5. Bad Master CylinderThe master cylinder is a major component of the brake system. It?s needed to hold brake fluid and generate enough hydraulic pressure to feed the brakes. However, this part can also wear down and cause leaks over time.The master cylinder deals with two types of leaks. You could have an external or internal leak, which is usually caused by a bad piston seal. Either way, there will be a loss of hydraulic pressure that causes the spongy brake pedal. 6. Failing Wheel CylindersIf you have a drum brake configuration, the drum is going to rotate against the wheel. In the drum, there are brake shoes that push into the drum with the help of wheel cylinder pistons.Hydraulic pressure is needed to move the shoes into the drum so the wheels slow down. However, wheel cylinder corrosion can lead to leaking fluid that reduces the pressure. What you are left with is a soft brake pedal. 7. Malfunctioning ABS Hydraulic AssemblyIf your vehicle is equipped with ABS, it also has an hydraulic assembly that?s known as the ABS modulator. Within this assembly, there are multiple valves and solenoids that can fail.If an internal failure occurs in the ABS control module, the valves may not open correctly, which would cause a spongy pedal. Plus, it could cause issues with the ABS. "
what are the  differences Spongy and Soft Brake Pedal ?	"The terms spongy and soft brake pedal is commonly interchanged with one another. While this will work, the terms do have slightly different meanings. Spongy brakes feel like you are pushing into a spring when you get toward the floor. On the other hand, your soft brake is going to go all the way to the floor or push beyond where it should without too much pressure. Either way, the same causes lead to both problems."
How to Fix a Soft Brake Pedal ?	"To fix a soft or spongy brake pedal, you need to look for any brake fluid leaks and fix them if you find a problem. You also want to bleed the brake system and make sure the brake shoes are properly adjusted. Then you need to inspect parts like the brake master cylinder and other brake parts.1. Diagnose SystemInspect BrakesTo determine the best fix, you must first figure out what?s wrong. If there is air in the system, you need to move on to step two and look for brake fluid leaks. Even minor leaks can cause the brake pedal to get soft or spongy, so it?s important that it?s 100% sealed.Otherwise, faulty parts need to be replaced to fix the problem. If you don?t feel equipped to handle the diagnosis, you should visit a qualified repair shop instead. 2. Bleed BrakesIf your diagnosis leads you to believe that the brakes need to be bled, the process isn?t that difficult. Here are some general steps you can follow, as long as the manufacturer doesn?t recommend something else.Park the vehicle on a flat surface. Lift the car and put it securely on jack stands.Uncap the master cylinder and remove the old fluid with the vacuum pump or by using a turkey baster. Don?t completely dry out the master cylinder.Put new brake fluid in the master cylinder. Allow the cap to remain loose for airflow. Consult the service manual to determine what wheel needs to be bled first. You must work in a particular order, normally starting with the wheel farthest from the master cylinder.Find the brake bleeder valve. This small screw is normally on the brake caliper on disc brakes and on the wheel cylinders of the drum brakes.Connect your vacuum pump to the bleeder valve so a seal forms.Open the valve with a wrench.Vacuum pump out the old fluid.As the fluid bleeds out of the valve, check the master cylinder to ensure it doesn?t run dry. Continue adding new fluid to the master cylinder.You can stop when there are no more bubbles and the fluid color becomes clear. Close the valve and repeat the steps on the other wheels. Once you are finished, you must make sure the master cylinder is full. Reinstall the cap. Carefully lower the vehicle back to the ground.Take your car for a test drive and see if the brakes feel better. They should be firm now, without any of that spongy feeling. 3. Replace Faulty PartsIf the low fluid is due to a leak, you want to replace the appropriate hoses before you fill the system back up. Additionally, any other defective parts should be replaced.Your diagnostics should have helped you find the problem, whether it?s a bad master cylinder or faulty calipers. If you can handle the repair yourself, follow the procedures laid out in the service manual. 4. Visit MechanicIf you run into any trouble or you don?t feel equipped to handle it, you should seek help from a professional. While some of these procedures seem simple enough, it?s never wise to take on something you aren?t familiar with.Your brake system is vital to your on-road safety. For this reason, you should avoid messing with anything you don?t have the experience to do. "
what are the Signs the Brake Pedal is Spongy ?	"1. Pedal SinksThe most obvious sign that the brakes have gotten spongy is when the pedal sinks down further than it should. In a well-running brake system, the pedal should maintain an adequate amount of pressure. You should know where the pedal normally pushes to when you step down on the brakes.If the pedal starts to sink lower than normal, you know they are getting spongy or soft. You can head off bigger problems by paying attention to this sign right away. 2. Must Pump BrakesTo stop or slow down, you should only need to push the pedal in. If this simple action isn?t helping, you may resort to pumping the brakes in a repetitive motion to get it to respond. Most often, this indicates a brake fluid leak or a mechanical failure. As the problem gets worse and the pedal becomes spongier, you could lose braking power completely. 3. Brake Warning LightIf you aren?t used to the vehicle or haven?t noticed any issues with the pedal, you might have to rely on the warning system to let you know there?s a problem. Modern cars have built-in warnings on the dashboard to alert you when there?s a failure.On your dashboard, you could see a brake warning light. However, this doesn?t automatically mean the brake pedal is spongy. It could indicate any trouble with the braking system. Either way, it shouldn?t be ignored. "
What Can Cause a Spongy Brake Pedal?	"The brake pedal becomes spongy when there?s air in the lines or fluid is leaking. It can also be caused by mechanical failure, either from the calipers, master cylinder, wheel cylinder or ABS components. A complete diagnosis is needed to figure out what should be fixed. "
Is It Safe to Drive With Spongy Brakes?	"It?s never safe to drive a car that has a spongy brake pedal. You should get the car to a safe location and identify what are causing the problem immediately. If the brakes were to go out completely while you are driving, a major accident could occur. "
Why are My Brakes Still Spongy After Bleeding?	"It?s possible that you haven?t removed all of the air from the brake system. In this case, you should attempt bleeding the brakes again. Other than that, the problem could be a leak or mechanical failure of one of the other parts. "
What are the Symptoms of a Failing Master Cylinder?	"When the master cylinder fails, it can?t apply the right amount of hydraulic pressure to the brakes. The pedal starts to feel soft and mushy. It can also sink further than it should as the system begins to leak. The only ways to resolve the situation is to replace the master cylinder or repair the leak. "
Can Low Brake Fluid Cause Spongy Brakes?	"The brake system must have the right amount of fluid inside to work properly. If the fluid gets low, you will have reduced stopping power when you push down the pedal. It can also feel spongy and soft, leaving you in a dangerous situation if the system fails. "
Conclusion	"At the first sign of spongy brake pedals, you must jump into action. In most cases, low fluid or a leak is to blame. Either way, you need to fix the problem before you head back on the road to ensure everyone remains safe and protected.Some common causes of a spongy or soft brake pedal include:Air in Brake LinesBroken Brake LinesBrake Shoes Need AdjustmentWorn CalipersBad Master CylinderFailing Wheel CylindersMalfunctioning ABS Hydraulic AssemblyIf you are not comfortable working on your own vehicle, it is always best to take it to a professional to be checked out."
What Does The TRAC OFF Light Mean?	"The TRAC OFF light indicates that the Traction Control system is turned off on your Toyota vehicle. In some cases, the light indicates that you have turned the system off manually, while other times, it can show that the traction control is facing a malfunction.If you have pushed the button for the traction control system, you may also see the VSC (vehicle stability control) light. On the other end, when there?s a malfunction, it?s common for the Check Engine Light or other MILs to come on the dashboard, further indicating what the problem might be. The TRAC OFF light can look different depending on what model you drive. In some cases, you will see the letters ?TC? on the dashboard. Otherwise, there could be an image of a vehicle with lines that are bending opposite of the tires. "
What Causes The Trac Off Light?	"The most common cause of a TRAC OFF light is that you pressed the TRAC OFF button in your Toyota vehicle by mistake. If you see the TRAC OFF light along with a check engine light or other warning lights, there may be a problem with the traction control system.Here is some more detailed information on the causes of the TRAC OFF light.1. You Turned it OffThe main reason that the TRAC OFF light comes on is due to you turning the system off by mistake. You can hit a button to turn the traction system on or off. When it?s off, the dashboard will indicate this, so you know that it needs to be reactivated. Hitting the switch is all that?s needed to turn it back on.Many times, when you physically turn off the traction control system, the vehicle stability control will also deactivate. You could also see the VSC light on the dashboard or a picture of a vehicle sliding on the road with the words OFF listed. This above is usually the only reason for a TRAC OFF light.If you see the Trac Off light along with a check engine light on your dashboard, it could be a sign that there is a problem with your traction control or engine control system. This can be caused by any of the following issues.2. Poor Road TractionIf you see a blinking traction control light on your dashboard, it could mean that you are driving on a slippery surface and that the car is skidding. If this is the case, the light will only come on temporarily until the road gets better.The most common cause of this condition is because of snow or ice. However, even a good amount of rain can lead to reduced traction, which leads to a temporary malfunction. 3. Defective Wheel SensorYour car is equipped with wheel speed sensors that feed data to the engine control unit and the traction control system. These sensors are responsible for measuring each wheel?s rotational speed.If there?s a failure with the sensor, the system will receive data that appears inaccurate. For safety reasons, the traction control system will shut off so as not to malfunction. 4. Failed Steering Rack SystemHydraulic fluid gets pumped into the steering rack, so you can spin the wheels with ease while driving. To maintain traction, controlled steering is imperative. Modern steering systems use many different sensors for the system to function properly.If there?s a failure in the steering rack or any of the sensors, such as the steering angle sensor, you could lose traction control functions. Until the problem is resolved, the traction control system will remain deactivated to ensure safety. 5. ABS MalfunctionThe anti-lock brake system also plays a big part in your on-road handling. If there?s a malfunction with the ABS, you could see the traction system shut off as well.The problem could be related to the ABS controller. However, the wheel speed sensors are also part of the ABS system, which we discussed earlier. 6. Computer MalfunctionModern vehicles have been built with many different computers, each running a different set of operations. When a computer malfunction occurs, the traction control system can act up and turn off automatically. When a computer malfunctions, it doesn?t normally just affect one system. For this reason, this is one of the most unlikely options on the list, but also most noticeable because there should be several other symptoms happening at the same time. "
How to Fix the TRAC OFF Light?	"To fix the TRAC OFF light, it is enough to just press the TRAC OFF button again to activate the system in most cases. It may also help to restart the vehicle by cycling the ignition. If these steps do not work, you will need to read the trouble codes with a scanner.Here is some more detailed information on how to fix the Trac Off warning light:1. Turn it OnIf you?ve turned the traction control system off by mistake, it?s simple to fix the problem. You simply need to push the traction control button and turn it back on.Usually, the TRAC OFF button is found to the left of your steering wheel in most Toyota models.

You can choose an independent mechanic to handle this diagnosis or pay a little more to visit your local dealership."
When Should TRAC Be Turned Off?	"If you are driving off-road or driving on a very muddy or snowy road, you may want to turn off the traction control system. With the system on, power from the engine to the wheels is reduced, which only adds to the problem.By turning off the TRAC system, you can rock the car, truck or SUV free from where it sits. Push the button in and look for the sign on the dashboard. Once you get out of this situation, you can push the button again to re-enable it.The reason that there?s a button to turn off the TRAC system is due to the times when it becomes necessary to disable it. Under normal driving conditions, it?s best to leave the system engaged."
Can I drive my car if the Trac Off light is on?	"You can drive your car with the Trac Off light on, but you will not have the traction control function in your car. If you are not used to driving without traction control, it can cause problems and even serious accidents if you are not fully aware of it."
Why is my Trac Off and check engine light on in my Toyota?	"If you see a TRAC OFF light along with a check engine light and sometimes also a VSC light in your Toyota, it means there is a problem with your traction control system. To find out what are wrong with the system, you must read the error codes with a scanner."
How do I turn off the check engine light and TRAC off light?	"To turn off the check engine light along with a TRAC OFF light, you need to fix the problem that caused it and then reset the codes with a code scanner.

If you see this light along with other warning lights such as the check engine light or the VSC light, it may be due to some more serious problem.I hope you enjoyed this article and now have all the knowledge you need to fix the TRAC OFF light on your dashboard."
what are the Causes of Steering Wheel Shaking When Braking ?	"If your steering wheel is shaking while braking it is most likely caused by warped, worn, or rusty front brake rotors. It could also be an issue with the calipers or brake pads. Other than the brakes, shaking can also come from the wheels or failure in the suspension system. 1. Worn Front Brake RotorsBecause the steering wheel is shaking when the brake pedal is pressed, you can almost guarantee that the issue lies with this system. Two of the main parts that tend to fail are the brake pads and the rotors. As you continue braking, the material installed on the pads gently wears off. If the material fades, you can hear a squeaking sound and experience some shaking every time you brake. If you don?t get the pads changed quickly, the rotor could also become damaged.The rotors work like a set of discs. Each rotor is attached to the wheel?s hub assembly, found between each set of brake pads. When you push the brake pedal down, the pads squeeze into the rotor to slow down the wheels. If the rotors become worn or warped, there will be additional vibrations as you step on the pedal. This problem can also cause a grinding noise. If your steering wheel is shaking, the issue is most likely with the front brake rotors or other front brake parts. If the whole car is shaking, but not in the steering wheel it is very likely that it?s the rear brake parts causing it.2. Stuck Brake CaliperIf the brake pads or rotors aren?t the problem, don?t just overlook the rest of the brake system. The calipers could also be leading to your shaking problem. In your brake system, the calipers are responsible for pushing the pads into the brake rotor. As you put pressure on the pedal, fluid is sent into the chambers of the caliper. This fluid creates the pressure needed to push on the pedal, with the amount of force based on how hard you push the pedal.Calipers can get stuck because of a lack of lubrication or failure. If the caliper is stuck that it won?t activate, vibrations could occur. Additionally, the calipers can get stuck engaged which can create heat and warp the rotors. In this case, you should also notice vibrations while you are driving since the brake pads will drag along the rotor. It?s also possible that a burning smell will accompany the problems. 3. Poor Wheel MaintenanceIn the rare case that the brakes aren?t causing the issue, you need to look at the wheels. There are several aspects of the wheels that could be giving you trouble, but most of the issues are going to cause vibrations at all times, not solely when you are braking.To start, it could be that the wheels need to be aligned. With a wheel alignment, your car should drive in a straight line on a smooth road. If the car is shaking or pulling to either side, it could indicate that the alignment is off. Additionally, it could be time for a wheel balance. As the wheels become imbalanced, more shaking is known to occur. Wheel balancing could be necessary after running the tires without the right amount of air pressure. If you choose to keep driving like this, you are eventually going to wear out vital and expensive suspension components, so it?s best to deal with it immediately.Finally, there?s always the chance that you have a rim that?s bent. Bent rims happen when you allow the wheels to make contact with something, such as a curb or pothole. Depending on how the rim is bent, you may notice an abnormal amount of shaking. This condition is often more noticeable at higher speeds than lower speeds and during braking, but you shouldn?t rule it out. 4. Failing Suspension ComponentsOnce you?ve worked through looking at the brakes and wheels, the only other logical option is that there?s a problem with the suspension. Any time that a suspension part fails, there?s a chance of shaking. Again, the majority of these shaking issues are going to be felt while driving and braking, but it?s possible you only notice it as you are slowing down.Considering the suspension is designed to dampen the road imperfections and bumps, it only makes sense that shaking occurs as it wears out. The trouble is determining which part has failed since there are so many that make up this system. "
How to Fix a Shaking Steering Wheel ?	"Inspect/Repair BrakesConsidering the most probable cause of the shaking is your brakes, it?s wise to start with this system. If you haven?t serviced the brakes in a while, it?s time to start now. Begin with an inspection of the front brake pads and brake rotors. If you notice any unusual wear or the material is getting low, go ahead and replace them. You should always replace brake pads in pairs across the axle. The cost per axle might be somewhere between $100 and $350. You should also inspect the brake rotors. Over time, the rotors are known for warping and wearing down. Depending on how thick the material is, it?s possible to have the rotors resurfaced to buy some more time. Resurfacing usually costs around $30 for each rotor. If resurfacing isn?t an option, replacement is the only solution. This expense could run from $150 to $450 for each pair of rotors.After this regular maintenance is performed, it?s time to look at the brake calipers if you are still having trouble. It?s possible that the calipers just need some lubrication. This could help relieve the stuck situation. If not, the calipers need to be replaced, which might cost about $200 to $300 for each one, including parts and labor. Maintain/Replace WheelsOnce you?ve worked through the brake system, it?s time to refocus on the wheels if shaking is still occurring. Begin by reading tire pressures to ensure that you are running at the manufacturer?s specifications. Aside from this vital step, you must also consider the importance of getting wheel alignments. Most manufacturers recommend getting it done every 6,000 miles. You shouldn?t spend a lot of money on the alignment, especially if you bundle it with other services. Regular wheel balance is also important. Again, this service is recommended for 6,000 miles. To get all four wheels on your car balanced, you could spend around $100. The worst option is that the wheel is bent. Normally, this is the most expensive issue since the entire rim needs to be replaced. Depending on the size and type of rim, you could easily spend $500 or more. Repair Worn SuspensionYour next step is to inspect the suspension system. There are many parts involved, so this inspection could take some time.Pay close attention to the axles and CV joints. Based on what?s wrong, you could spend a good amount on the repair, but it?s necessary to ensure a safe drive. Talk to a ProfessionalIf none of the previous steps led you to the problem or you don?t know how to fix what you?ve found, go ahead and visit your local mechanic. With more advanced tools and diagnostic equipment, the job will be much easier.In most cases, any reliable mechanic will do. However, you might prefer choosing a brand-specific technician if you drive a luxury vehicle."
Is it safe to drive with a shaking steering wheel?	Driving with a shaking steering wheel is never a good idea. This will wear out the front suspension and other things much faster than usual due to the vibrations. There is also a risk of total breakdown if you don?t know what are causing the shaking steering wheel.
Can a bad wheel bearing cause a shaking steering wheel when braking?	"Yes, a bad wheel bearing could cause shaking when braking, but it?s not a very common cause. Warped or rusty brake rotors are a much more common reason why your car is shaking when braking."
Can a bad ball joint cause a shaking steering wheel when braking?	"Yes, a bad ball joint can cause the front suspension to vibrate when braking. But a warped, worn or rusty brake rotor is much more likely to cause a shaking steering wheel when braking."
Why does my front end shake when I brake at high speeds?	"If the front of your car shakes when you brake at high speeds, it is very likely caused by warped or worn front brake rotors. It can also be caused by other worn brake parts or suspension problems."
What Does Service Brake Assist Message Mean?	"When the Service Brake Assist message comes on the dashboard, it means there has been a malfunction with the Brake Assist system. It?s possible that a brake sensor has failed or there isn?t enough pressure in the brake system. Either way, it should be looked at right away.Brake assist monitors the amount of pressure being placed on the brake pedal. If more pressure is needed in the event of an emergency, this advanced system supplies the additional power. "
Benefits of Brake Assist ?	"The Brake Assist system measures how much pressure is applied to the brake pedal. It ensures that the pressure is sufficient enough to prevent collisions during an emergency stop. If the system determines that a fast stop is necessary, but you haven?t fully pressurized the pedal, extra hydraulic pressure will be applied. This added pressure closes the distance until the vehicle is completely stopped. It can prevent an accident from occurring, which is priceless. "
differences bettwen Brake Assist and ABS ?	"Brake Assist is a high-tech safety system included in some modern vehicles. It?s not identical to anti-lock brakes (ABS), which are included with every vehicle these days. However, both systems are meant to improve braking performance. Brake Assist can supply additional pressure on the brake pedal if there?s an emergency. It helps drivers stop before a collision occurs. On the other hand, ABS maintains the braking of the vehicle if the wheels start to lock-up. It provides more control of the car. ABS also keeps the wheels from locking up, so you can come to a stop safely. "
differences between Brake Assist and Automatic Emergency Braking ?	"Brake Assist might sound like a form of Automatic Emergency Braking, but these two aren?t the same. Brake Assist is going to apply pressure for you. If you push on the pedal but not hard enough for the situation, the advanced system is going to give you the extra boost you need.On the other hand, the Automatic Emergency Braking system is going to work without your input. If there?s a dangerous situation determined by the sensors and you aren?t braking despite warnings, the car will brake on its own. It?s an autonomous technology that handles the operation for you. It?s normally included with vehicles as part of a safety package, or it can be added as an optional feature. "
Causes of the Service Brake Assist Message ?	"In most cases, if you see a service brake assist message with no ABS light or any other message, it is caused by a bad brake pressure sensor or a brake light switch, depending on the car model. However, there are many different reasons why this message can appear, so a proper diagnosis is necessary. Let?s take a look.The most common causes of the Service Brake Assist message include:Bad Brake Pressure SensorFaulty Brake BoosterBad Brake Booster Check ValveVacuum leaks to the brake boosterOld brake fluidFaulty ABS SensorFaulty ABS RingWiring issuesIf you see this message in your Chevrolet together with a Service Stabilitrak message, service traction control message and an ABS light, there may be bigger issues with the brake system."
How to Fix Service Brake Assist Warning ?	"1. Reset the LightThere?s always the chance that the light came on by accident. It?s unlikely, but you want to rule this option out before moving on. By resetting the brake assist light, you can ensure that there?s actually a problem. The best way to do this is to use an OBD2 scanner. However, if you don?t have access to one you can also try to remove the power.With the vehicle in a location that?s safe and the engine off, you can disconnect the negative cable to the battery. Go in your vehicle and push on the brake pedal until all of the electricity inside is removed. Once that is completed, go ahead and reconnect the cable to the battery and start the engine. The light should be off at this time.Take the vehicle for a test drive to see if the light comes back on. If it does, you need to move on to the following steps.2. Read the trouble codesWhen dealing with problems in modern cars, you always want to read the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner to make diagnosis much easier. You can either get an OBD2 scanner to use at home, but you may need a special scanner for your car model if it would be compatible with the brake assist system.Read the codes and continue with the troubleshooting after you get this information.3. Check Brake Pressure SensorOne of the main issues with the brake assist systems is the brake pressure sensor. If a sensor fails, the system could fail. To fix the problem, this sensor needs to be replaced. This sensor is often located on the ABS unit or at the master brake cylinder, depending on your car model.The part will cost $10 to $150. If you can get the sensor installed on your own, you won?t have anything else to spend. Even if you need a mechanic to install the sensor, you may only spend $75 to $200. 4. Check for vacuum leaks and check valveFor the brake booster to work properly, it needs a vacuum. In most vehicles, there will be a hose from the engine intake manifold to the brake booster to provide a vacuum. There will also be a check valve that keeps the vacuum inside the brake booster when you accelerate the car.If this check valve is broken, or there is a vacuum leak somewhere, you will lose brake pressure and the service brake assist system may pop up. If you have a diesel engine, it could also be due to a faulty vacuum pump.5. Check Brake FluidThe system?s brake fluid is what helps to create pressure. This hydraulic fluid is needed when you push down the brake pedal and it?s utilized by the brake assist system. If the system is low, you might not get the brake pedal pressure you need to stop in time.Take a minute to check the level of the brake fluid. It is simple to determine if more should be added with clear indicators on the dipstick cap or reservoir. If the fluid looks dirty or contaminated, it might be better to perform a brake fluid flush. This professional service might cost around $100, and it is usually listed on the recommended maintenance schedule for every two years or 30,000 miles, whichever comes first. 6. Replace Brake BoostersThe brake booster is the device that increases the force being applied from the pedal to the master cylinder of the system. It?s the component that differentiates a power-assist braking system from a manual setup. If the brake booster fails, you could get a Service Brake Assist warning light. If you can replace the brake booster yourself, you might spend $100 to $500 for the part. If you need to pay a mechanic, you could spend another $150 to $450 on labor costs. However, these prices are strictly estimates, with the make, year and model of your car determining how much you will spend.7. Replace faulty ABS partsIf you see the service brake assist message along with the ABS light or traction control light, it may be a problem with the ABS system and not the brake assist system. The most common problems with the ABS system that can cause problems with brake assist are also a bad ABS sensor, bad abs ring or a bad ABS pump.8. Talk to a MechanicIf none of these steps led to a repair, it?s time to talk with your mechanic. With sophisticated technology like the Brake Assist system, it can be difficult to pinpoint what?s wrong.However, certified mechanics have access to better diagnostic equipment and tools. For this reason, they might be better equipped to hunt down the problem."
Can Brake Assist Be Turned Off?	"There are some models that allow you to turn off safety features if you prefer. You might have a button that allows you to turn this off, but it?s unlikely. To figure out what?s possible with your model, you should reference your owner?s manual. Just remember that these systems are off and won?t be protecting you during this time. "
Is It Safe to Drive with the Service Brake Assist Warning?	"You shouldn?t drive with most warning lights on the dashboard. However, the Service Brake Assist light should be especially alarming. In fact, you are going to be put in a lot of danger with this system malfunctioning.Without complete control over the braking system, collisions and accidents are more likely. If the light comes on, I recommend pulling over to a safe place. You should have the problem looked at right away or take it to a mechanic."
Is brake assist important?	"Yes. Brake assist is important in the event of an accident. If your brake assist is not working, it will take much longer to bring the car to a complete stop in an emergency. This could be the difference between life and death."
Is brake assist the same as ABS?	"No. Brake assist and the ABS system are two separate systems. However, they work closely together, and while the brake assist applies brake pressure to the wheels, the ABS system limits the pressure so as not to lock the wheels."
Can I Use Brake Fluid As Power Steering Fluid?	"No, brake fluid is very different from power steering fluid, and these shouldn?t be used interchangeably. If you put brake fluid into the power steering system or vice versa, you can cause irreparable damage to the vehicle. Both of these are only meant to be used in their respective systems.If you added brake fluid to the power steering fluid reservoir or vice versa, you will want to drain the system and refill it with the right fluid to prevent damage or accidents."
what are Power Steering Fluid?	"Power steering fluid is petroleum based. While it works as a lubricant between the metal components, it?s also needed to provide pressure transfer.This fluid helps apply the necessary pressure to the hydraulic piston. With this fluid, the wheels turn with ease as you maneuver the steering wheel. "
what are a Brake Fluid?	"Most brake fluid is glycol based. While it also provides some lubrication, it also absorbs moisture to prevent corrosion from occurring.This fluid helps to apply pressure from the brake pads to the rotors. With this action, the car can stop when you push down the brake pedal. "
differencesbetween Power Steering Fluid and Brake Fluid ?	"1. CompositionPower steering fluid is petroleum based. While gasoline is also petroleum-based, these do not have the same composition.On the other hand, brake fluid is usually glycol based. You may also have heard of this ingredient based on what?s included with some antifreeze mixtures. 2. Heat ControlPower steering fluid provides a pressure transfer medium and is also a lubricant for metal-to-metal components. This fluid absorbs heat yet remains at the same viscosity for reliable performance.Brake fluid isn?t needed for lubricating parts the same way, even though it does provide some benefit. Mainly it absorbs moisture to prevent corrosion from occurring. It also dissipates the heat while remaining at the same viscosity. Because of the high boiling point, the brakes won?t fail on you or get spongy. 3. System CompatibilityPower steering fluid is needed for the dynamic steering system in your vehicle. If it is used in the brake system, it can damage the rubber parts. Brake fluid is basically a non-lubricating fluid. If used in the power steering system, the vital parts won?t get the protection needed and damage will occur. "
what are the Power Steering Fluid Alternatives ?	"If you are out of a power steering fluid and are in a pinch, you might be able to use an automatic transmission fluid. These two are often similar in composition and some manufacturers permit them to be used interchangeably. However, you should always check the owner?s manual before you swap any fluid for another.Vehicles don?t use as much power steering fluid as transmission fluid. For this reason alone, manufacturers put the two into different bottle sizes with differing packaging. With unique packaging, the manufacturer can advertise the fluid for a different price. "
What to do if Brake Fluid was Used for Power Steering Fluid ?	"If you put brake fluid into the power steering reservoir accidentally, you must take quick action. You can prevent major damage by following these steps.Do not turn on the vehicle or drive it. It?s important to prevent the brake fluid from circulating through the power steering system, you can prevent damage from happening. Without turning on the vehicle, all of the brake fluid that was poured in will sit in the reservoir. Open the reservoir to the power steering fluid.With a baster, start removing the fluid from the container. Make sure you place it in an appropriate container.Jack up the vehicle in the front. Secure it on jack stands.Move the steering wheel from side to side. You should see more fluid come into the reservoir.With your turkey baster, continue removing the fluid that appears. (Optional) To be on the safe side, you can also empty the whole system. Disconnect the system?s low-pressure line. Drain the fluid into an appropriate container.Continue turning the wheel so more fluid can be flushed out.Pour in some new power steering fluid and drain it back out as well. This step helps to flush out anything remaining in the system. You should repeat this step several times, just to be sure.Put the system back together.Lower the vehicle gently back to the ground.Fill up the power steering system with the appropriate fluid type.If you don?t want to work on your own car or you are nervous about draining this system properly, you should get help from a professional mechanic. However, you can?t drive it to the shop. Instead, you would need to have the car towed. A mechanic can provide a professional flush, ensuring there?s no remaining fluid in the system."
Damage Caused by Brake Fluid in Power Steering System ?	"If the brake fluid is able to circulate through the system, you will have a much harder time getting it out. Not only will this fluid smell bad, but you will notice something different with the steering system.At first, it can cause the rubber seals to swell, leading to a leak. If left unchecked, the long-term effects can become pricey to repair. For example, if you need to replace the power steering pump, you could spend anywhere from $250 to $1,000, depending on the type of vehicle you drive. "
How to Check Power Steering Fluid ?	"1. Locate ReservoirThe first step to checking the power steering fluid is finding the appropriate reservoir. After all, your car probably has several containers filled with fluid under the hood.You can look in your owner?s manual to find its location, as each model is different. It should be a small container that?s clear and it usually contains a black cap on the top. 2. Examine DipstickIf the vehicle has a dipstick system, there will be marks on it to look at. It should remind you of an oil dipstick. Remove the cap for the dipstick and wipe it clean with a shop towel.If there?s no dipstick, you will examine the tank by the marks on the side. There should be a MAX and MIN line where the fluid should rest between.3. Double-CheckPut the cap back on so the dipstick rests back in the fluid. You want to double-check it to see what level the fluid is at. Most dipsticks contain marks that either say MAX and MIN or Full Hot and Full Cold. Either way, you want to ensure the level is located at the appropriate spot on the dipstick. 4. Fill, if NeededIf the power steering system is low, you need to top it off. Fill up the reservoir until it reaches the proper level. If the fluid looks contaminated, you might want to perform a power steering flush instead. Most manufacturers recommend performing this maintenance task every 40,000 to 80,000 miles."
Can I mix brake fluid and power steering fluid?	"No, you should not mix brake fluid and power steering fluid. Mixing or using these in the wrong system can cause serious damage to your car or even cause accidents. While both fluids are designed to lubricate and protect your car?s components, they serve different purposes and mixing the two can cause problems."
Can I use transmission fluid instead of power steering fluid?	"It depends, in many older vehicles, the transmission fluid and power steering fluid were the same. However, in modern cars you will often find that these two fluids differ from each other. Check your owner?s manual and use only a compatible fluid for your vehicle."
Can I use brake fluid for anything else?	"Brake fluid is a type of hydraulic fluid that is used in brake and clutch systems. While brake fluid is not something you can just use for anything else, it does have a few other uses beyond braking. Sometimes brake fluid can be used to clean metal parts, and brake fluid can also be used as a hydraulic fluid for other applications such as hydraulic jacks and lifting equipment."
Can I use transmission fluid as brake fluid?	"No, transmission fluid should not be used in place of brake fluid. Using transmission fluid in your brakes can cause damage to brake components and may even result in loss of brake power, which can result in a serious accident or even death."
what are Symptoms Of A Bad ABS Control Module ?	"The most common symptom of a bad ABS control module is an ABS warning light on your dashboard. You may also notice locking wheels while braking on slippery surfaces. Another less common sign is a stiff or unresponsive brake pedal.These are not all the signs, so here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing ABS control module to look for:1. Locking WheelsCar Brake DistanceThe ABS control module ensures that the wheels don?t lock up when traction is lost. However, as this part fails, the information needed to keep the wheels from locking isn?t accurate.If your wheels begin to lock up when traction is lost, the ABS control module might be to blame. Typically, you will only notice the problem if you slam on the brakes. Otherwise, if the wheel is consistently locking up, it could be a stuck brake caliper instead.2. ABS Warning LightAbs LightAll newer cars contain an ABS dashboard light to tell you when a problem exists. If the ABS control module fails, this is one reason for the light to illuminate.Newer models contain an amber light that says ABS. However, older models don?t have this dedicated light. They might use the Check Engine Light instead. Once the ABS light is on, the system might stop functioning at all. Even if you can drive without the ABS, you shouldn?t. It is a vital safety feature that is meant to protect you. 3. Increased Braking EffortBrake Pedal FloorWhen you push the brake pedal down, it should still stop you. However, the effort needed to stop might become more pronounced. As time passes, you might notice it takes more effort to stop your vehicle and push down on the brake pedal. If it feels like you are getting a leg workout every time you need to stop, you might want to have the system checked. 4. Unresponsive Brake PedalPush Brake PedalWhen you step on the brake pedal, you want to know that the vehicle is going to stop. However, a bad ABS control module can make stopping more difficult. At first, you might notice the increased braking effort discussed above. As time goes on, this effort will become more pronounced and might even cause you to lose the brake pedal function completely. This issue can also be caused by low brake fluid levels, so be sure to perform a complete system inspection. You might consider having the brake fluid system flushed to ensure no air exists in the lines. 5. Inaccurate Speedometer ReadingsCar SpeedometerSometimes, when the ABS control module fails, the speedometer ceases to operate normally. This isn?t a common occurrence, but one that could happen. Either the speedometer will sit at 0 mph, or it will read the incorrect speed. This symptom is usually in conjunction with the Check Engine or ABS light coming on."
ABS Control Module Function ?	"The ABS (anti-lock braking system) control module is an electronic device that acts as a computer. Information coming from the ABS sensors is processed by the ABS control module. Then, the ECU takes the data and processes it, creating electronic information to ensure the system works as it should.When the vehicle loses stability or traction, this system is responsible for processing the next steps to ensure safety. It can also help determine how much pressure needs to be applied to each wheel to stop it. The control module effectively monitors the braking frequency and the required braking pressure. It uses the information received from the sensors indicating how fast the tires are rotating to avoid any slippage. "
ABS Control Module Location ?	"The ABS control module is found in the engine compartment of most vehicles. However, it can also be found on the driver?s side frame rail in a few models. You may need to lift the vehicle to find the ABS control module. It could also be located under plastic panels or covers. You will find the ABS control module bolted to a solenoid block with several brake lines connected to it. If you are unsure, reference the service manual to find the location for your vehicle?s make and model. "
ABS Control Module Replacement Cost ?	"The average ABS control module replacement cost is between $200 and $1500, depending on the car model and labor costs. The ABS control module should cost between $150 and $900 for parts, and the rest is the cost of labor.If you complete the replacement yourself, labor won?t run you anything. Otherwise, professional fees might run from $80 to $300, depending on how accessible the module is. For many amateurs, it makes sense to have a professional mechanic replace the ABS control module, since the braking system can be touchy. The problem is that you often need to code or reprogram the new control unit with special diagnostic tools, which may only be available to the dealership.You also want to look for any technical service bulletins regarding the ABS control module or its software. For example, many Volkswagen cars have a bulletin on the ABS module."
Is the ABS module repairable?	"Yes. The ABS control module is often repairable, but it is not easy. Also, repairing it can sometimes be more expensive than simply replacing it. You should consult a mechanic or car dealer to determine if your ABS module can be repaired or needs replacement."
How long do ABS modules last?	"ABS modules are designed to last the lifetime of a vehicle, but like any other component, they can eventually fail. Many factors can affect the lifespan of an ABS module, including how often it is used, what model it is, and what kind of driving conditions it is subjected to. In general, however, you can expect an ABS module to last at least ten years."
How do I reset my ABS control module?	"On modern cars, the only way to reset the ABS control module is to use a compatible OBD2 scanner. In older models, it may be enough to disconnect the battery and then reconnect it after a few minutes. This will often refresh the system and clear any errors that may have occurred."
Can you drive a car with a bad ABS control module?	"Driving with a bad ABS control module can be dangerous and should be avoided if at all possible. Bad ABS control modules can cause a number of problems with your car?s braking system, including reduced braking power, longer stopping distances, and sudden unexpected braking."
what are the Causes of Squeaking New Brakes ?	"The most common reasons why your new brakes are squeaking are excessive moisture, increased heat, or a normal break-in period. You may have also installed low-quality brake pads that are causing the noise. However, a stuck caliper or worn-out rotors can also be to blame. Here is a more detailed list of what could cause your brakes to squeak after new brake pads or rotors:1. MoistureAny type of moisture can build up on the brake pads and rotors. If there has been rain, snow or ice recently, the brake pads might just need to dry out.Even overnight condensation can accumulate on the metal parts to create surface rust. Thankfully, a few times of braking should resolve the issue. 2. Break-InIf you?ve changed the brake pads yourself, you need to allow for a break-in period. While placement is imperative to ensuring the pads are coming in contact with the rotors perfectly, you may also need to drive a few minutes.The break-in is even more important if you change the rotors at the same time. To accelerate the process, drive in an empty parking lot and brake slowly over and over again. Don?t jam on the brakes, but focus on gentle, slow stops. 3. HeatWhen new pads are installed, you are ready to push your car to its limits, but you shouldn?t. Right after a brake pad change is not the time to start towing heavy loads or climbing mountains. Additionally, riding the brake can cause too much pressure on the pads which can lead to excessive temperatures. In any of these situations, the brake pads become too hot and squeaking is bound to occur. During this time, the brakes are also less effective, so be careful.4. Low-quality Brake PadsIf you choose a new brake pad set with high metal content, you might notice some squeaking. The majority of brake pads come with some sort of metal mixture, including graphite, copper, steel and iron. Depending on the composition, you might notice squealing as the pad touches the rotor. However, there are other brake pad materials that might squeak less. You can look at organic pads that contain rubber, glass or resins, but the best option might be ceramic brake pads. 5. Stuck CaliperYour brake pads move because of the caliper pins that need to contract and release the pads from the rotors. If one caliper pin sticks, the pad could get jammed into the rotor at an angle, which would lead to squeaking noises.If you?ve changed the pads without noticing the problem, you haven?t resolved anything. Additionally, if both of the caliper pins stick, you might also notice a burning smell. 6. Worn RotorsYou may have replaced the pads but neglected to change the rotors. If the rotors are worn, there are still going to be some issues, including squeaking sounds when the rotors can?t function properly with the pads. With bad rotors, it becomes harder to stop the vehicle. It can also create a grinding sound as the metal continues to wear down. Plus, you are going to wear out brake pads faster if you run bad rotors. Other Brake Issues to Watch ForGrindingYou should never hear grinding sounds right after replacing the brake pads. Because you aren?t running metal-to-metal, squeaking is much more likely to occur. The grinding sound typically comes from the pads going below the wear indicators and making metal contact. If you hear any grinding sound after changing the brake pads, there could be an issue with the hardware. You want to have the system checked right away. PulsatingIf the brake pedal starts to vibrate when you push on it, you need to look at bigger problems. It?s also possible that this symptom can combine with an illuminated brake warning light and a burning smell.In some cases, the pulsating feeling is caused by a stuck caliper. It can also create a pulling sensation on the wheel when braking. "
How to Fix New Brake Noise ?	"1. Wear Off MoistureThe repair to the brake squeaking depends on what the problem is. If there was precipitation overnight or an excessive amount of condensation, you just need to drive a little bit to get rid of the extra moisture. Once the brake pads have dried out, there should be no more squeaking. If the squeaking persists, you need to look at one of the other options. 2. Break-in PadsNew pads must also be broken in. If you have them professionally installed, the repair shop should break them in for you.However, if you replace them on your own, you want to drive around slowly and continue braking until the pads are properly seated and working smoothly with the rotors. Choose a safe location to perform this task, such as an empty parking lot.3. Cool the Pads OffIf you?ve been pushing the brakes hard, it?s possible they are just hot. You might be climbing steep inclines or towing when it happens.In this case, the best solution is to pull over and let the brakes cool down. Reducing the heat will also improve the stopping power. 4. Swap Out PadsIf you put cheap brake pads on your vehicle, you might need to perform another replacement. Sometimes, it doesn?t pay to use the cheap pads, especially when you look at how often you might need to replace them.Ceramic pads suffer from squeaking the least because of the lack of metal. On the other hand, they do cost more and aren?t ideal for heavy braking situations. 5. Repair CalipersIf you have a sticking caliper, the only solution is to lubricate it or replace it. Sticking calipers are also going to create a car that pulls to one side and possibly a burning smell.Because this situation keeps the brake pad engaged with the rotor, you are going to wear through the material much more quicker. It also creates damage to the transmission, leading to premature wear. 6. Change/Resurface RotorsIf you tried to change the pads without paying attention to the needs of the rotor, you might have to do more work to rectify the situation. When new brake pads are installed with bad rotors, the pad can?t make optimal contact with the rotor surface.Not only will more damage occur to the new brake pads, but the sound will continue until you fix it. In some cases, you will be able to resurface the rotors. However, if there?s not enough remaining space or you have a thin rotor, you will need to replace them entirely."
What does the ESP light mean?	"The ESP Light indicates there is a problem with your electronic stability program system or that you are driving on a slippery surface. When you drive through slippery surfaces, the ESP light will turn on and flash on your dashboard when it?s working.If the light is constant and not flashing on and off, you have a problem associated with your Electronic Stability Program."
How does the ESP system work?	"The ESP does not work alone. It works in conjunction with the traction control and the anti-locking brakes (ABS). Modern cars have an onboard computer that monitors most of the car?s functions.If one wheel slips, the ESP will control the other wheels by reducing power and applying the brakes to correct your car?s stability.The ESP can also inform the car?s engine to reduce power if your car is steering dangerously. This will then influence the power that is being supplied to individual wheels. This comes in handy when, for example, you keep revving the car on the icy ground, but there is no traction on the wheels. Power will be reduced, enabling you to have more grip on the wheel."
what are the  Causes of an ESP warning light ?	"The most common reason the ESP light illuminates is because of a faulty ABS sensor or ABS ring. It can also be caused by issues like a bad throttle body, brake pedal switch, or steering sensor. If it?s blinking while driving on a slippery surface, it?s working correctly.The ESP works together with the ABS. This makes it hard to identify the main cause of the problem immediately.To determine the problem causing the ESP light, it is always recommended to check the trouble codes with a diagnostic scanner.Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of an ESP light.1. Faulty ABS Speed SensorCar Abs SensorThe wheel sensors send information about each wheel?s speed to the ABS control unit. The ABS control unit then measures this information and applies necessary solutions when one or more wheel slips.If one ABS sensor fails, it may think that one wheel is slipping even when it isn?t, which will cause the light to come on.2. Faulty ABS ringsBroken Abs RingThe same thing applies to the ABS rings. The ABS sensor measures the wheel speed from the ABS rings. These rings sometimes break, and when that happens, it will cause the ABS sensor to measure the wrong speed.3. Faulty Throttle bodyThrottle BodyThe throttle body is used to control the power output for the ESP system when your car slips. If there is anything wrong with the throttle body, it will cause the ESP light to come on.4. Faulty Brake Pedal SwitchBrake Pedal PushThe ESP system needs to know when you are pressing the brake pedal. For this function to work properly, there is a brake pedal switch installed on your brake pedal.If this switch is faulty and sends out the wrong information, it may cause the ESP light to come on.5. Faulty Steering Angle sensorSteering AngleThe ESP system also uses the steering angle to calculate what to do in a slipping situation. If your steering angle sensor is becoming worse or is not programmed correctly, it may cause the ESP light to come on.6. ABS wiring issuesAbs Broken WiringYou do also have wirings from the ABS control unit to each wheel sensor at each wheel. These wires move a lot because of the suspension, and this can often cause the wiring to become worse when your vehicle becomes old.The easiest method to see this is to measure the ABS sensors from the connector plug at the control unit. To do so, you need to check a repair manual for the correct pinout."
What to do if the ESP light comes on?	"If your ESP light illuminates, you need to check the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner to see what are causing the ESP light to come on. Just guessing and replacing parts you think are faulty, will likely waste a lot of your money.You can either check the trouble codes at a workshop or do it yourself at home with an OBD2 scanner."
Is it safe to drive with the ESP light on?	"If you are not used to driving without the ESP, it is probably not safe to drive with the ESP light on. The ESP system is designed to maintain the traction of your wheels on slippery surfaces, and it is important that it works correctly. If the light is on, it means there is a problem with the system, and the ESP system will be disabled."
Is ESP the same as traction control?	"No. The ESP system is not the same as the traction control system. The traction control system is designed to prevent slipping and skidding when cornering, while the ESP system is designed to prevent your wheels from spinning on slippery surfaces."
What happens if you drive with ESP off?	"If you drive with ESP off, the only difference is that the ESP system will be switched off. If the ESP system is disabled, your car?s tires will spin freely on slippery surfaces, and if you are not used to this, it can make it difficult to control your vehicle and could result in an accident. ESP can help prevent accidents, so it?s important to keep it on while driving."
How do I reset my ESP warning light?	"To reset an ESP warning light, you must use an OBD2 scanner. However, simply clearing the fault code memory will likely not solve the problem permanently. To get rid of the ESP warning light, you need to fix the problem that is causing the light to appear in the first place."
Conclusion	"The ESP light indicates that there is a problem with your car?s electronic stability program (ESP) that needs to be repaired. It can also flash if you are driving on a slippery surface. The ESP system cooperates with the traction control, the ABS system and the engine control system.The first thing you should do if you see an ESP light on your dashboard is to read the trouble codes from the ABS, traction control, and engine control systems. For this, you need a good OBD2 scanner compatible with your vehicle.If you see this light come on and feel like you don?t have enough knowledge, it?s important to have your vehicle checked out as soon as possible by a professional mechanic. While the problem may be something minor, such as a dirty sensor, it can also indicate a more serious problem."
When To Resurface And When To Replace Brake Rotors ?	"Resurfacing or replacing the brake rotors is a very frequent question. Is it really worth it and will it save some money by resurfacing the brake rotors? Let's find out!Resurface Or Replace My Brake RotorsBrakes need maintenance, just like your car engine. When the time comes to replace the brake pads, you will wonder whether to replace or resurface the brake rotors. Both options are good for certain circumstances, so we will perform a complete replace vs. resurface brake rotors evaluation.In this guide, we discuss what brake rotors are and the value of either option. We also talk about when you should consider resurfacing the brake rotors over replacing them."
Should I resurface or replace the brake rotors?	"In most cases, it?s not recommended to resurface brake rotors and it?s better to replace them. Resurfacing will result in less material on the brake rotors which will increase the temperature. Most car manufacturers do not recommend resurfacing the brake rotors.However, if you have a very old and cheap car you may want to save a little bit of money by resurfacing the rotors. Keep on reading to find a more detailed answer with the pros and cons of resurfacing vs replacing the brake rotors."
What are Brake Rotors?	"The brake rotor is a vital component of the disc brake system on your vehicle. The rotor itself is heavy and made from metal. It resembles a disc connecting the wheel to the wheel hub. As the wheel rotates, the rotor also spins.The brake pads get sandwiched on the rotor. When the brake pedal is pressed, the brake caliper, which is a hydraulic clamping part, squeezes the pads into the rotor. This action causes the friction that stops your car.However, time wears out the brake pads, which is why you need regular replacement. In addition, the brake rotors also wear down over time. As the heat from braking takes a toll on the rotors, they get thinner. When performance is diminished, you have two options ? either resurface the brake rotors or replace them. "
what are the Pros & Cons of Resurfacing Brake Rotors ?	"By resurfacing the brake rotors, you can reuse them. Part of the surface of the rotor is removed to provide brand-new performance. With resurfacing, you might be able to get more miles out of the rotor without replacement. Considering that brake rotor replacement can be costly, this provides a good way to save money.However, to get the brake rotors resurfaced, you need to visit a professional mechanic. It?s unlikely that the average automotive enthusiast will have the appropriate tools in their garage to get the job done right."
How Much Does It Cost to Resurface Brake Rotors?	"The average cost for resurfacing brake rotors is between $20 to $40 for each brake rotor. If the shop is already performing a brake pad replacement, this might be included in the service. If you are doing your own brake pad replacement, you will need to remove the rotors and take them to your local shop. This causes some downtime that doesn?t make every at-home mechanic happy."
When Should Brake Rotors Be Resurfaced?	"The rotors should be examined every time the brake pads are changed. If they are in good enough condition to be resurfaced, it is something to consider. There must be enough thickness left on the rotor to provide adequate braking power. Some of the material will be shaved off, so that must be accounted for.  However, if your brake rotor is thick enough and you don?t mind paying for the service, it?s a great way to get more life out of this vital part and it money too.  saves you"
what are the Pros & Cons of Replacing Brake Rotors ?	"The biggest benefit to replacing your brake rotors is that you can do the job yourself. If you prefer changing your brakes at home, it makes sense to also swap out the brake rotors. You won?t need any special tools or equipment to get new brake rotors installed. However, this costs more than resurfacing. If you can?t do the job yourself, you are also looking at more costly repair bills to have the rotors replaced. "
what are the Replacing Brake Rotor Cost ?	"Typically, brake rotor replacement costs $350 to $500. The cost of the new brake rotors might be between $200 and $400, while the labor can cost around $150. If you can do the job yourself, you are still looking at a lot of money for the rotors. Plus, you will need to pay for the brake pads to be replaced as well. "
When Should Brake Rotors Be Replaced?	"Modern brake rotors seem to be thinner than older ones. Manufacturers are doing this to save weight, but it is also forcing more frequent rotor replacements. As they get thinner, it becomes impossible to resurface them safely. In fact, some manufacturers recommend never resurfacing their rotors, leaving you with no viable option but to replace them.In this situation, you can continue to use the brake rotor until it shows signs of wear. You shouldn?t need to replace them every time you get new brake pads, but they should be inspected carefully. If you put new brake pads on with a bad rotor, you are going to quickly ruin the pads, leaving you with another replacement.If your rotor shows significant signs of wear and can?t be resurfaced because it is too thin, you must replace it. Additionally, it?s always best to replace the rotors in pairs, front and back. If only one side is ready to be replaced, you should replace the other side anyway.We do almost always recommend replacing the brake rotors on modern car models instead of resurfacing them. This is mainly because they are often vented and have thinner material than older car models. It is also because brake rotors have become thinner nowadays."
What Does The ESP BAS Light Mean?	"The ESP BAS Light indicates a problem with the electronic stability program or brake assist program with your vehicle. Some of the top causes for this light include defective wheel speed sensors, a bad steering angle sensor, a bad brake switch, or other braking system failures. The light comes on for a variety of problems, ranging from mild to serious. However, the codes can be read with the help of a handheld code scanner that?s compatible with these systems. "
what are the ESP BAS Light Causes ?	"1. Defective Steering Angle SensorSteering Angle Sensor LocationModern vehicles contain advanced sensors, including one for the steering angle. Sadly, this sensor also leads to the majority of reasons that the ESP BAS Light comes on. The steering wheel sensor keeps the steering wheel in line with the car?s wheels. With the help of the sensor, the car knows which way you turn the steering wheel based on the input given by the steering angle sensor. The sensor can lose contact due to a poor connection, causing the ESP BAS light to show up on your dashboard. It could also mean that the sensor has failed. 2. Bad Wheel Speed SensorAbs Sensor CloseEach wheel contains a speed sensor that measures how fast the wheel is moving. These sensors are also part of the vehicle?s ESP BAS system. With the help of these sensors, the ESP BAS system can tell when traction has been lost, so it can counteract the issue.In normal circumstances, the ESP BAS Light can come on because traction has been lost momentarily. However, as soon as the situation is resolved, the light should go off on its own. If it doesn?t, there?s a chance that one of the wheel speed sensors is bad. 3. Failed Brake SwitchBrake Light SwitchThe brake switch can also cause the light to come on. Even though this part is supposed to last forever, there?s always the chance that it has failed. The switch turns on the rear brake lights when you push down on the pedal. If it isn?t working, people behind you might not know that you are stopping or slowing down. That?s why the failed switch must be replaced as soon as you are aware of the defect. 4. Wiring IssuesThere are a lot of wires going between all the different sensors and the ABS control module. The wirings to the ABS wheel speed sensors are attached to the wheels, and sometimes they get damaged.This is not very common in newer car models, as the wirings are often very protected, but it can still happen if you are unlucky. The bad thing about wiring issues is that they can be very difficult to find if you are not experienced."
How To Fix The ESP BAS Light?	"The easiest way to determine what are causing the ESP BAS light is to read the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner from the ABS control module in your car. This will help you locate the issue or start troubleshooting instead of just guessing and replacing parts.Here are some other common things that can fix the ESP Bas warning light:1. Recalibrate Steering Angle SensorSometimes, the steering angle sensor just needs to be recalibrated. You can do this in your driveway without any special tools.Sit behind the wheel of your car and gently turn the wheel from one side to another, where it would lock. You might also need to cycle the key for the calibration to take effect. In some cases, an OBDII scanner can recalibrate the steering angle sensor. Read the codes and recalibrate as needed. 2. Replace Steering Angle SensorIf the calibration doesn?t fix the problem, you might need to replace the sensor. Thankfully, this job is usually simple and only requires the use of a socket and ratchet.Make sure you unplug the battery first. You must then remove the airbag from the steering wheel by pushing on the clip located on the rear of the wheel. Lock the steering wheel in the center and use your socket and ratchet to remove the main nut.Mark the wheel?s position, so you know where the center is. After you remove the clock spring, you will see the sensor. Take it out and put the new one back in. Connect everything back up and turn on the vehicle. You will also need to recalibrate the system for the light to turn off. 3. Replace Wheel Speed SensorBehind each set of braking discs, you can find the wheel speed sensor. Because of how easy it is to access, it?s relatively simple to replace a defective sensor, but sometimes it can get stuck by rust.Jack up the vehicle and remove the affected wheel. When you take off the sensor, you can pop the new one in its place with ease. 4. Install New Brake Switch SensorWith your OBDII code scanner, you can hunt down the problems with the brake switch sensor. Unlike some of the other sensors, this one is inexpensive. You will find it located above the brake pedal. Simply unplug the defective sensor and put the new one in. You might also need to reset any codes that were set to turn the light off. 5. Repair BrakesIf it?s time for a brake job, get it done and see if it turns the light off. Put the car up on jack stands and take the wheels off. When you unbolt the brake caliper, make sure you rest it somewhere, so none of the lines break.From here, you can remove the rotor and replace it if needed. You might prefer to have it resurfaced if there is still plenty of material available. Additionally, it?s not hard to replace the brake pads. The problem comes in when the caliper is stuck. Unless you have advanced brake system expertise, you might need to have a professional help out."
what are a Brake Fluid Flush?	"During a brake fluid flush, all of the old, contaminated fluid is removed from the system. It?s replaced with fresh, clean fluid to ensure superior braking ability. The brake fluid flush is generally performed every 30,000 miles or two years, whichever comes first. It?s just as important to regularly check the brake fluid levels. If the system doesn?t have enough clean brake fluid, there can be performance issues that put your safety at risk."
Why my Car Needs a Brake Fluid Flush ?	"The brake system contains many working components that must operate in harmony for superior performance. Whether the car has disk brakes on all four wheels or it contains drum brakes in the back, it?s still connected by tubes and hoses that link each brake to the master cylinder. As you push down on the brake pedal, the plunger pushes into the master cylinder, causing brake fluid to run through the connected hoses to the brakes at each wheel. With disk brakes, this fluid gets pushed into the caliper that applies pressure to the piston so the brake pads can grip the disk and slow down the wheels. With drum brakes, fluid gets pushed into the wheel cylinder so the shoes can apply pressure to the drum and stop movement. Either way, the fluid is necessary for braking power.Over time, components in the braking system start to deteriorate. Debris, rust, rubber, condense and other contaminants will flake away and end up in the brake fluid. As the fluid becomes dirty, it?s less able to perform its job, leaving you with brakes that don?t work properly. Additionally, brake fluid is considered hygroscopic. It absorbs moisture and becomes less effective the older it becomes. Plus, the metal components don?t hold up well against this moisture and can easily corrode. "
what are the Brake Fluid Flush Cost ?	"The average brake fluid flush cost is typically $75 to $250. The price includes both parts and labor. If you complete the brake fluid flush yourself, you could save some money.Additionally, the cost varies based on your location and the labor costs in the region. It can also depend upon the make, model and year of your vehicle. "
Signs Your Car Needs a Brake Fluid Flush ?	"1. MileageThere?s plenty of debate over how often a brake fluid flush should be performed, but most car manufacturers will outline the recommendation in the service manual. If you are unsure, it?s best to follow the 30,000-mile or 2-year standard.The regular maintenance schedule relies heavily on your driving style. If you are commuting in the city where lots of braking is involved, you might need more regular flushes than the person driving on the highway each day. 2. Spongy Brake PedalIf the brake pedal starts to feel spongy or loose when you push it, now is a good time to change the fluid. If you leave the problem unchecked, the pedal could start going all the way down to the floor, which is very dangerous.As the fluid becomes lower and contaminated, air can infiltrate the system. What you are left with are brakes that don?t respond the way they should. 3. ABS LightThe anti-lock brake system helps keep your wheels from locking up when traction is lost. There?s an ABS warning light on the dashboard that indicates when there?s a problem with the system.If the brake fluid becomes low or heavily contaminated, the ABS light might come on. The system will also shut off to compensate for the lack of braking power. 4. Reduced Braking PerformanceIn normal circumstances, the brakes are going to operate quickly and efficiently. There should be no delays when you push the brake pedal down to stop. If there is, you might need a brake fluid flush.However, performance issues can also be related to worn-out brake pads, warped rotors or wear of another component. If you are unsure, it?s best to have someone perform a brake system inspection. 5. Noises/SmellsWhenever there?s an issue with the brake system, it can be caused by a worn component or low brake fluid. It?s possible to even deal with grinding or scraping, although these normally point to worn-out parts.If you notice burning odors when braking, there could also be burnt fluid from contaminants. However, the presence of burning should always cause you to stop driving and determine the cause to ensure your safety. "
How to Perform Brake Fluid Flush ?	"1. Empty Old Brake FluidYou need to drain out all of the old fluid from the master cylinder. There?s no drain plug to the system, so you will need to use a siphon pump or transfer pump.If all else fails, you can use a larger syringe or turkey baster. Keep removing the fluid until the reservoir is empty. Perform this step with the engine off and the car in Park. Also, make sure there is no pressure on the brake pedal. 2. Fill the System & BleedFill up the reservoir with fresh brake fluid. You will bleed the system the same way you do when you install new brake calipers.Begin at the back of the car and bleed the two rear calipers or wheel cylinders. Push down the brake pedal and open the corresponding bleeder screw. When the pedal reaches the floor, close the bleeder screw and release the pedal. Continue this process until all of the air has been removed from the system.Once the back brakes are done, you are ready to move to the front. Perform the same steps on the front brakes.3. Top Off & TestAfter you bleed each wheel, you must check the master cylinder reservoir to see if more fluid should be added. Additionally, you must top off the system once you are finished bleeding the brakes. Before you head out on the open road, take a short test drive of your vehicle. It?s best to find an empty parking lot or somewhere uninhabited to test the brakes out before using them in the real world. "
what are the Signs that It?s Time to Replace Your Brake Rotors ?	"The main signs it?s time to replace your brake rotors include:Vibrations when brakingLoud Braking NoisesCracks in the rotorsDamage/GroovesHere?s a more detailed list of the signs to look for when deciding whether it?s time to replace your brake rotors:1. Vibration when brakingVibrations DrivingWhen the brake pads or rotors are going bad, it?s common to feel a vibration in the brake pedal. When it gets really bad, the vibration will also extend into the steering wheel. Often this vibration comes from brake pad material that has collected on the face of the rotor, creating high spots. In some cases, it occurs when the brake system becomes overheated from excessive use. You may also notice more pedal feedback when the deposits build up. 2. Loud Braking NoisesNoise From CarAs brake pads start to fail, you will often hear a squealing or screeching sound. If the pads aren?t replaced promptly, metal-to-metal grinding can occur while braking.This loud sound also happens when brake components become heavily corroded, affecting the tolerance between them. If the situation is bad, dragging of the brakes can also occur. At this point, you should stop driving your car immediately until the brakes are repaired. Modern brake pads offer a wear sensor made from metal. As the brake pads get low, this material rubs the rotor and alerts you with an audible noise so you take action. Changing the worn-out brake pads promptly could save the brake rotors from wear. 3. CracksBrake Rotor DamageAfter the rotors are subject to excessive heat, the surface can crack. While there are multiple different types of cracks that occur, they are all related to either compression or expansion. Small hairline fractures might seem alarming, but in many cases, these can be repaired with resurfacing. You will most often see the hairline fractures when using the brakes at high temperatures, such as if you are racing. However, a crack that occurs on the rotor and extends to the edge will require immediate replacement. There is no fix for this type of rotor damage. 4. Damage/GroovesWorn Brake DiscOver time, the surface of the rotor can become grooved and damaged. This is caused by debris or worn components rubbing against the rotor. If the metal backing plate from worn brake pads makes contact with the rotor, it can cause damage. Also, corrosion and rust will create grooves on the surface. If you think the rotor is warped, you might want to take a second look. In reality, brake rotors rarely ever actually warp. Instead, you are noticing the unevenness of the surface. "
How Often to Replace Brake Rotors?	"Brake rotors should be replaced every 70,000 miles, more or less, depending on the car model and driving style. The only correct way to know if your brake rotors need a replacement is by visually inspect them.This is far longer than brake pads which are often replaced every 40,000 to 50,000 miles. The conventional steel brake rotors have the shortest lifespan, while carbon ceramic rotors can last the lifetime of the vehicle but cost much more.The health of your brake rotors depends on your driving style, how much your vehicle weighs, and the quality of the parts you choose. When you take the brake pads off, the rotors should always be inspected for wear. Resurface or replace them as needed. "
what are the Brake Rotor Replacement Cost ?	"Brake rotor replacement might cost around $350 to $500 for each rotor. This price includes about $200 to $400 for the rotor and $150 for the labor. If you can replace the brake rotor yourself at your home garage, you could save some money on the job.Thankfully, your brake rotors won?t usually require replacement every time you change the brake pads. They don?t typically incur as much wear and tear as the brake pads do. If there is enough brake rotor material left, you might be able to resurface them instead. The cost of resurfacing brake rotors is much less than replacing them. A qualified shop will be able to turn or cut the brake rotors, giving you a fresh surface to work with. The shop places the rotors on a lathe and removes a thin layer of the material until it is smooth and free of corrosion again.Typically, you will spend $10 to $15 for brake rotor resurfacing, making this a much more affordable option. However, you would still have to pay to have the rotors removed and put back on unless you can do this yourself. Additionally, it?s never wise to resurface the brake rotors when the material becomes too thin."
What Does TC Mean In A Car?	"TC in a car stands for Traction Control. It?s the automotive system that assists acceleration while preventing wheels from slipping or over-spinning while driving on low-traction surfaces. It?s a valuable safety system installed on most modern vehicles.The traction control is designed to provide a smooth drive in any situation. It helps balance stability with acceleration, even on slippery road surfaces, such as those driven on after a rainstorm. When one of the wheels is spinning faster than the others, the traction control system detects the fault with the help of the speed sensors. The car will automatically adjust the speed to the spinning wheel, so it can grip the road surface once again.The ECU may also reduce torque from the engine and activate the ABS if the brakes must be applied. In some cases, the traction control light might turn on the dash to notify you of the slippage. If the light turns back off immediately, there?s not a problem with the system. However, when the light stays on, there could be a fault somewhere in the system. "
When to Use the TC?	"You can leave the traction control system on all the time, even when the roads are clear. It?s automatically activated when the car starts, so you don?t need to do anything to turn it on. While you can shut it off manually, there are special situations when you should ensure it is on.If you are caught in bad weather, such as ice, snow or heavy rain, the traction control should be on. You will want the added support when traveling across wet or slippery road surfaces. It?s also helpful if you are driving on a curvy or windy road. As you take a turn, you don?t want to lose traction. This is especially important if the road surfaces are wet or muddy. "
When to Turn Off Traction Control? 	"The traction control system should be activated the majority of the time you are driving. Yet, there are some rare instances where it can be better to turn it off. For example, if you get the car stuck in snow, sand or mud, you might want to switch it off. Traction control can make it harder to get out of these situations when the wheels are spinning.In these situations, you want the wheels to spin so they can dig into the ice, sand, mud or snow and find solid ground. Once the wheel reaches this ground, traction can be regained and you can get the vehicle out. Additionally, if you plan to race your vehicle or participate in drifting, traction control would be your enemy. Instead, you want the wheels spinning just right for maximum coolness. "
differencesbetween Traction Control and Stability Control ?	"Traction control might be better known than stability control, but this is also a safety feature. They do work together to create a safer drive. Plus, both systems use wheel speed sensors to gain the information that?s needed. Stability control is designed to keep the vehicle stable and moving in the direction you want to go. It?s a complex system that adjusts the movement of the vehicle. In conjunction with the speed sensors, it also uses additional sensors around the vehicle to note the motion of the car versus its direction. If the two directions aren?t in alignment, the system helps to stabilize movement. As with the traction control, the brakes can be automatically applied to wheels that are moving too fast. This system has become a mandatory addition to all vehicles sold since 2012. "
Why is Traction Control Warning Light On?	"1. Poor Road ConditionsIf you hit a slippery patch on the road, the TC light might come on temporarily. This warning light is letting you know that the traction control system has been activated.However, the light should go off as soon as traction has been regained. If it doesn?t, there is a larger problem. 2. Bad Wheel Speed SensorsWheel sensors are needed to detect the speed that each one is running at. Each of these sensors is connected to the ECU, which keeps the traction control system in the loop.When one of the sensors goes bad, it doesn?t send accurate signals to the ECU. Because of this fault, the traction control light turns on until you replace the faulty wheel speed sensor.The cost to replace a wheel speed sensor might be about $325 to $400. Labor should make up about $75 to $100, while the part could cost $250 to $300. 3. Faulty Steering Angle SensorThe traction control system is carefully monitoring the angle of the steering wheel. The sensor also reports how fast the steering wheel is turning while you drive. If there?s something wrong with this sensor, it needs to be replaced.The traction control light turns on when the sensor fails. It can be found in the steering column if you want to try changing it yourself. The cost to replace a steering angle sensor might be between $125 and $500. Labor might make up $75 to $250, while the sensor itself could cost $50 to $250. 4. ABS MalfunctionThe anti-lock braking system works hand-in-hand with the traction control system. These parts use a lot of the same sensors and components to run. Because of this, if there is a fault in the ABS, it?s possible that the traction control light might come on as well. To determine what the cause is, use your code scanner to discover what part is defective."
What does the ABS Light mean?	"An ABS light on your car?s dashboard means there is an issue with the car?s anti-lock braking system. The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) is a safety system that prevents the wheels of a vehicle from locking up when braking and this warning tells you that the system is not working as intended.When you turn on the vehicle?s ignition, you should see the ABS light come on for a second as the system performs diagnostics. After this self-check, the light should turn off.If it doesn?t light up at all, the bulb might have burnt out. On the other hand, if the ABS light doesn?t turn off or it comes on while you are driving, you need to figure out what?s causing the alert."
what are the  Causes of the ABS Light ? 	"1. Bad Speed SensorAbs Sensor CloseThe wheel speed sensor takes the rate at which the wheels are moving and reports it to the ECU. With this information, the ECU can determine how to use the ABS. If the ECU sees that one of the wheels is moving faster than another, it will push out more brake fluid, allowing the wheel to move at a slower rate to increase grip on the pavement.When the speed sensor stops working, the ECU won?t have accurate data. Not only will this cause the ABS light to come on, but you should also notice that the car can lose traction when you slam on the brakes. In fact, the traction control light might also come on. The speed sensor is mounted very close to the wheels so it can measure how fast they are moving. Because of its location, it endures a lot of damage from being by the brakes and dealing with all of the excessive heat. It can also endure damage from metal shavings or debris coming off of the brakes.2. Bad ABS Tone RingBroken Abs RingThe ABS sensor needs something to read the wheel speed from, and this is the ABS tone ring. Sometimes the ABS ring becomes rusty and cracks, which causes the ABS sensor to give an incorrect measurement, which causes the ABS light to illuminate on your dashboard.Some ABS rings are installed inside the wheel bearing and in that case, you need to replace the entire wheel bearing. However, if it is installed on the driveshafts, you can often inspect it visually to see if you can find any cracks or other damage.3. Defective ABS Module or WiringsAbs Broken WiringIt?s possible for the ABS module to go bad. However, the wiring itself might also be to blame. These wires are subject to corrosion that would cause delays or a lack of communication between the ABS module and speed sensor. It would be better if the car just needed some updated wires. However, you may need to replace the ABS module if you are unlucky, which costs much more.With either problem, you should notice a lack of response with the brakes. At first, you might only notice it periodically, but it should continue getting worse. It?s also possible that the brakes could lock up or you might hear some clicking noises 4. Malfunctioning Hydraulic PumpAbs PumpThe ABS system must control the brake fluid that comes through the hydraulic pump. This pump is responsible for pushing brake fluid through the cylinder, so it?s distributed to the brakes when the brake pedal is pushed down. The ABS system also adjusts the brake pressure to each wheel based on the reading from the speed sensor. With this information, the appropriate amount of fluid can be pumped to the brakes where it is needed the most. In most cases, this system works just as intended. However, the hydraulic pump can fail or you could face a malfunctioning valve in the hydraulic system. Neither of these situations is good. The pump is subject to debris and metal shavings from contaminated brake fluid, it can wear out. However, if you get the fluid changed regularly, you help prevent this situation from occurring.When you have issues with the pump, braking performance becomes disintegrated. It will start out slowly and get worse as you let it go. If the master cylinder fails, the brakes can feel good one minute, but you can lose complete power a second later, making it very dangerous to drive. Additionally, there could be a fluid leak as a result of the defect. If the fluid is seeping out, the pedal can start out firm, but it will get spongy until it sinks down to the floor. 5. Blown FuseThe ABS runs because of the electrical parts of your car. In fact, the ABS runs on its own fuse. These fuses are not immune from failure. For no reason at all, a fuse can blow at any time. Thankfully, it isn?t difficult to check the fuse. In fact, it might be the first step of diagnostics if you aren?t noticing any symptoms other than the light comes on the dashboard. 6. Low Brake FluidThe ABS pump needs brake fluid to work correctly. This fluid is pushed through the cylinder to feed the brake system. If there?s not enough brake fluid, you are going to run into issues, including a possible illuminated ABS light.If the fluid is low, it?s important to figure out why. It?s possible that you have a leaking fluid reservoir, air in the brake system or a seal that is damaged. It can also happen when the brakes are worn. If you allow the system to get too low, the ABS module won?t balance the pressure between each wheel, so there will be slippage and skidding. As the brake fluid continues to get lower, you might also see that it becomes harder to stop. There?s also the chance that more noise will occur when you are braking. "
Diagnose ABS Light ?	"If you want to figure out what needs to be replaced, consider following these steps.Check the ABS fuse. This step only takes a few seconds and it can save you a lot of headaches. It?s located in the fuse panel under the dash. You can find a diagram pointing to the fuse location in your owner?s manual.Check the brake fluid level. If the brake fluid is low, add some more. If it looks contaminated, drain it and refill it. Check the system for leaks. You should be able to see leaking brake fluid from under the car. Fresh fluid has a light yellow color, while contaminated oil will appear slightly darker, even brown.Test the ABS wheel sensor with a voltmeter. You can also read trouble codes with your OBDII scanner that should point out if there?s a fault.If you are having trouble finding the problem, it?s time to take your vehicle to a qualified mechanic for further diagnostics. "
How to Fix ABS Light ?	"You can spend as little as $20 to as much as $1,000 to fix the ABS light, depending on the problem causing it to come on. Let?s take a closer look at the most common repairs to fix the ABS light, but you must perform a complete diagnosis to determine what?s causing your problem before you start replacing parts. After all, there is no reason to put parts on the car that aren?t needed. The cheapest issue would be a blown fuse. Not only should this fix cost you $20 or less, but it?s easy to fix. Simply open the fuse panel and replace the one running the ABS. The next easiest fix will be to add more brake fluid if it is low. This fix only costs you the price of the brake fluid, as long as there are no issues causing a leak. From here, you could replace a faulty speed sensor or a bad ABS tone ring. The average for this repair might be between $100 and $300. This seems to be one of the most common issues with the ABS light. There?s also the chance that you need to replace the ABS module or rewire the system. Fixing the wiring fault might be cheaper, but a new module will probably cost you $200 to $600. The largest of the problems would be to replace the hydraulic pump or a master cylinder. The master cylinder replacement could be between $300 and $600 while putting a new hydraulic pump can easily hit $1,000 or more. "
Can I Drive with the ABS Light On?	"The short answer is yes, but it really depends on your situation. This answer comes with a big warning. The only way you should drive with the ABS light on is if you know there are no issues. You don?t want your normal braking affected or you put yourself at risk. The ABS system will be out of function if the ABS light is on, and therefore it may cause danger if you are not used to driving a car without ABS.Even if the braking system seems to be fine, it could fail at any time if there?s a problem. For that reason, it?s imperative to take the ABS warning light seriously. You don?t want to be left stranded somewhere and you don?t want to cause an accident. We understand the need to save money and we know that all car repairs don?t always show up at the best times financially. However, the cost you will pay if an accident is caused can be immeasurable. Instead of taking chances, we recommend having the ABS codes scanned to find out what the problem is immediately. "
How long can you go with the ABS light on?	"It?s not recommended to drive with an ABS light on at all, especially not if you are not used to driving cars without ABS. But even if you know how to drive cars without ABS, you still want to check what?s causing it. You should take your car to a mechanic as soon as possible to have it diagnosed and repaired."
Can low brake fluid cause ABS light to come on?	"Yes, if the brake fluid level gets low, it?s possible that the ABS pump will lose pressure and the anti-lock brake system (ABS) will go into ?fail-safe? mode. When this happens, the ABS light will come on."
Can you drive without ABS?	"You can drive without ABS, but it is not recommended. Without ABS, your braking ability will be reduced and it will be more difficult to control your vehicle in emergency situations. If you must drive without ABS, be sure to allow extra distance for braking and be extra careful when driving in slippery conditions."
Can a weak battery cause ABS problems?	"A weak battery could cause ABS problems, but it?s not very common. You will more likely find other malfunctions with your car first if your car battery is bad. However, if you?re having ABS issues, it?s worth checking your battery to see if it may be the culprit."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Brake Master Cylinder ?	"The most common symptom of a bad brake master cylinder is a spongy or sinking brake pedal. You may also notice decreased braking ability or in the worst case, no brakes at all. If you see brake fluid on the ground, it may also signify a bad brake master cylinder.Here is a more detailed list of the most common signs of a bad or failing brake master cylinder to look for:1. Strange Brake Pedal BehaviorPush Brake PedalAt first, you?ll likely notice the brake pedal acting unusually. The master cylinder generates all of the pressure needed to brake.So, if there is a problem with distributing the pressure or sealing, you will feel it in the pedal. As the seals in the cylinder continue to wear out, there could also be leaks occurring. That?s part of the reason that the brake master cylinder causes a mush or spongy pedal. You might even have it traveling all the way to the floor. Sadly, this symptom alone won?t tell you that the master cylinder is bad. A spongy pedal more commonly means that there is air in the brake lines. Your car may just require a brake fluid change.2. Inconsistent BrakesBrake PedalAs the master cylinder starts failing, the brakes can act erratically. At first, the brakes might work as normal, and the next second you could lose braking power completely. This is of course a very serious issue because it gets even more dangerous when you do not know when the brakes work as they shouldAdditionally, the pedal can feel firm one second and head to the floor the next. 3. Decreased Braking AbilityLonger Brake DistanceWhen the master cylinder begins to fail, it can cause the brakes to go out in just the front or the back. When this happens, you will notice a significant decline in braking power.As you prepare to stop, you aren?t counting on this extra time and you could end up getting into an accident. Other malfunctioning brake system parts can cause this same symptom. You might be dealing with air in the brake lines or old, worn-out fluid. These symptoms also occur if you have a blown brake line or hose.4. No BrakesFlipped Car AccidentIn the most serious cases, the brakes might not work at all. While this doesn?t happen often, it is possible. The master cylinder operates as a hydraulic pump, constantly pressurized the brake lines when you touch the pedal. With this design, it is much more common to lose brakes in either the front or back, but not both. However, you could find yourself with no brakes at all when the master cylinder fails. 5. Leaking FluidCar Fluid LeakInspect the system for any brake fluid leaks. If you notice leaking brake fluid coming down the back of the master cylinder along the brake booster or firewall, you have an issue.You may even see brake fluid running down the firewall inside the cabin. Eventually, this leak will cause the system to run out of brake fluid, which reduces your stopping power.As fluid continues to leak, you will also notice the spongy pedal we talked about earlier. While it might regain some firmness when you pump it, it won?t last for long until a repair is performed. "
what are the The Function of a Brake Master Cylinder ?	"The master cylinder acts as a hydraulic pump. It is responsible for feeding brake fluid to the brake circuit, where it converts the pressure from the brake pedal into stopping power. Think of the master cylinder as a syringe. Every time pressure is applied, the fluid pushes out of this cylinder to the brakes. Modern master cylinders contain two chambers, each operating one set of wheels. Because of this design, you should only lose brakes in the front or back when a failure occurs, not typically both. There is a reservoir built into the master cylinder that holds brake fluid. When the brakes are applied, fluid flows into the brake lines, which makes the brakes work. After the brake pedal is released, the fluid returns back to the reservoir, thereby releasing the braking system and allowing the wheel to move once again. "
Brake master Cylinder Location ?	"The brake master cylinder is located beneath the brake fluid reservoir. To find it, look under the hood on the driver?s side of the vehicle. It is typically found on the firewall. You will spot it because it has two or four brake lines attached to the main body. It?s also attached to the brake fluid reservoir with a small wiring connector. "
Brake Master Cylinder Replacement Cost ?	"The brake master cylinder replacement cost is between $250 and $400. You have two options when replacing the master cylinder. You can choose a rebuilt cylinder or buy a new one.Because of how important the braking system is to your safety, it?s often recommended to choose a new master cylinder. A new master cylinder costs $35 to $75, depending on your car model. The rest of the expense is the labor at your local shop. If you plan to do it yourself, you don?t need any specialized tools. However, you will want to factor in another $4 for the brake fluid and about $10 for the necessary bleeder kit."
What Does TCS Mean On A Car?	"TCS on a car stands for Traction Control System. The traction control systems detect when the wheels are about to lose traction. When the system detects this, it intervenes by reducing engine power to the wheel. This helps the car to maintain traction and stay on the road.If you see a TCS light on your dashboard, it means there is an issue with the traction control system, which I will now discuss further."
What Does The Traction Control Light mean?	"The traction control light (TCS) illuminates when there is a trouble code stored in the traction control system. The traction control system helps to keep you in control of your vehicle in the event that one or more of your wheels lose traction while you?re driving.This is most common in snowy, icy, or otherwise less than ideal road conditions. Moreover, your driving patterns affect how often you?ll need your traction control system. The more reckless you drive, the more you?ll need traction control to bail you out."
Traction Control System Light (TCS) Function ?	"Your TCS light serves several functions. For starters, it lets you know when the system is active. When you?re driving and the light flashes on and off, it means that your traction control is on. You?ll feel the brakes locking up and releasing as the ABS kicks on and off. If your wheels were slipping, everything is working as it shouldMoreover, the light should turn on and then off when you first turn the key in the ignition. This is a system check, and as long as the light goes away, it means that everything is working the way it should.When you should be worried is when the TSC light doesn?t go away after the system check. If it stays on, it means that your vehicle?s traction control system isn?t working the way it should, or you?ve turned it off.Finally, if the light is flashing randomly as you drive even though your wheels aren?t losing traction, that means you have a serious fault in your system, and you shouldn?t be driving your vehicle until you fix it. Otherwise, you?re risking your ABS randomly applying your brakes as you drive, and this could quickly lead to an accident."
what are the Causes of Traction Control System Light (TCS) ?	"The most common cause of a TSC light is that the system is turned off or a faulty wheel speed sensor. But while those are the most common problems, they aren?t the only things that could lead to a TSC light.Below, I?ve highlighted the four most common reasons your vehicle?s TSC light might be on.1. TSC System Turned OffDid you know that you can turn off your vehicle?s traction control? While the specific steps to do it for each vehicle are slightly different, almost every vehicle allows you to do this. While it usually only helps you when you?re trying to drift, it?s one of the most common reasons this light stays on.Look up how to turn your vehicle?s traction control on and off. Give it a shot. If the light goes away, that was your problem. But if it doesn?t, keep reading.2. Faulty Wheel Speed SensorsBy far the most common reason that a vehicle?s traction control system starts acting up is because of a faulty wheel speed sensor. Each of your vehicle?s wheels has a sensor that reports how fast it?s spinning to the ECM.When one or more of those readings doesn?t match what the rest of the wheel speed sensors are reporting, then your traction kicks onto to remedy the situation. But if the wheel speed sensor is offline or reporting faulty readings, your traction control is going to start acting up.3. Faulty Steering Angle SensorAnother critical component in your traction control system is the steering angle sensor. That?s because as your vehicle turns, the outside wheels are going to turn faster than the inside wheels. This is completely normal, and it?s your steering angle sensor that lets your ECM know what?s going on.But if the steering angle sensor reports that you?re still going straight while you?re actually turning, the traction control system will register a fault, and it could kick on while you?re turning.4. Faulty Wiring/Electrical IssuesWhile wiring and electrical issues are less likely than a faulty sensor, it is still a distinct possibility. That?s because even if all the sensors are working correctly, it won?t matter if the wires that transmit that signal are corroded or broken.The most common location for faulty wiring is right by the wheel speed sensor since those wires are often exposed to the elements. Always rule out faulty wiring or deeper electrical issues before dropping a ton of money on new sensors."
Is It Safe To Drive With a Traction Control System Light (TCS) Light?	"It is usually safe to drive with a TSC light ? but it is not advisable to do so. The reason for this is twofold. First, your traction control system is there to help your vehicle maintain traction on slippery road conditions, so you?re losing an important safety feature when it?s not working correctly.Second, depending on the fault in the system, your traction control could kick on while driving. This would mean that your ABS would start applying your brakes as you drive down the road. This is incredibly rare, but it can happen, which is why you should fix the fault as soon as possible."
Conclusion	"While your traction control system can seem like a headache when it?s not working the way it should, this innovation has prevented thousands upon thousands of accidents throughout the years. So, while you might be cursing the system now, you?ll be thankful for it when you need it most.Take the time to fix your traction control system if it starts acting up. Chances are you?ll be thankful that you did."
Causes of Brake Caliper Piston Won?t Compress ?	"When the brake caliper piston won?t compress, it?s likely due to a rusty or corroded caliper piston, caused by a bad piston boot. If it?s the rear caliper piston, consider the chance that the incorrect wind back procedure is being used. Here is a more detailed list of why your brake caliper piston won?t compress:1. CorrosionRusty Caliper PistonThe most common reason why the caliper piston does not move is that the caliper piston is rusty or corroded due to a damaged caliper piston boot. Brake calipers can?t operate properly if corrosion or rust is involved. Any level of rust can affect the ability of the caliper pistons to compress.If you are using your vehicle regularly, this probably won?t happen to you. However, inactivity and driving on rainy or salted roads often can lead to corrosion, if the boot is slightly damaged.2. Worn Boot or SealsDamaged Caliper Piston BootOver time, the piston seals become worn. Eventually, the seals will fail completely, causing the piston to remain seized. It could also have to do with the rubber boot on the piston that protects it and keeps it lubricated. As the rubber tears or gets damaged, water will enter the piston and it will cause it to seize up. 3. Collapsed Brake HoseA common cause of a stuck brake caliper stems from the hose. If the hose starts to break or crack, brake fluid flows onto the piston. Because it can?t get back to the master cylinder where it belongs, the caliper is going to stick.However, there are times when the caliper itself isn?t actually stuck. In some instances, the broken hose situation just causes the brakes to feel the same way. Do an inspection to discover where the problem lies.4. Incorrect Wind Back ProcedureIf the problem occurs with the rear caliper, it?s possible that you aren?t following the guidelines of the service procedure. Remember that rear calipers operate differently from the front. You must use the right steps to get them compressed.You can?t simply push rear calipers back in. They must first be turned and pushed at the same time. You can use a wind-back tool to operate the rear caliper pistons with ease. If you have an electric parking brake, you may need a diagnostic tool to rewind the parking brake."
How to Compress Stuck Caliper Pistons ?	"1. C-ClampPosition the C-clamp over the caliper and up to the end of the piston. There?s a screw on top that must be adjusted correctly. You will want to use wood to shield the piston surface from damage. As you turn the screw, the pressure increases, allowing the piston to be compressed. Tighten this until the caliper is compressed where you need it. 2. Channel LocksWith channel locks, you can perform similar steps to the C-clamp. Put the channel locks where one end is behind the caliper with the other behind the pad. You want the caliper and brake pad to be located between the grips.Squeeze the channel locks together, so the piston is also compressed. You will want to start gently and increase the pressure as needed. 3. Piston Compression ToolBrake Caliper CompressionIf you have a special compression tool to work with the pistons, your job will be easier. Start by making sure the compressor is properly adjusted for the job. You don?t want to have the push bar hanging out.Put the caliper compressor alongside the caliper in front of the pad. Pump the compressor tool down while the push bar applies pressure to the brake pad. This action should lead the pad to push into the piston so it can retract. 4. ScrewdriverYou often don?t need any fancy tools to compress a caliper piston. In fact, your standard screwdriver might be able to finish the job nicely. Put your screwdriver into the caliper window. You must hold onto it tightly as you fit it in the openings. The screwdriver must dip until there?s an equal amount of balance of force. The pulling motion should cause the brake piston to pull back a little.When the screwdriver is in place, pull back slightly. You want the pressure to be firm against the pad in an outward motion. You can now put your screwdriver between the piston and brake pad. From here, you should be able to push the piston back with a gentle motion. "
what are the Cost to Fix Seized Caliper ?	"If you can get the caliper compressed with one of our tips, you might not need to replace it. Each situation is different. In fact, the problem could be the brake hose causing the same symptoms, so the caliper piston might actually be in working condition.However, if you need to replace the brake caliper, you might spend between $250 and $500. The parts cost about $100 to $300, while the labor might end up being between $150 and $200. The cost depends on the type of vehicle you drive and your local labor rates. If you can replace the brake caliper yourself, you can save some money on the labor, but the majority of this expense falls back on the part itself. You can sometimes restore the caliper with a new piston and seals, but it?s often cheaper and easier to buy a new caliper instead."
Why A Brake Pedal Goes to The Floor ?	"The most common reason why a brake pedal goes to the floor is due to a brake fluid leak or air in the brake system. It can also be caused by a faulty master brake cylinder or a bad brake booster. Air in the brake system can be caused by a low brake fluid level.These causes are the most common causes of why this problem may occur. Here is a more detailed list of the common causes of why the brake pedal goes to the floor when the engine is running or when starting the car.1. Brake Fluid LeakCar Fluid LeakThe most common reason why this happens is that you have a brake fluid leak somewhere on the brake system. This is often due to a rusty brake line, but it can also be due to problems with leaking seals at the caliper pistons.Brake fluid leaks are often very visible on the ground, though, so if you have seen a pool of fluid on the garage floor, it is definitely time to check for any brake fluid leaks.When you press the brake pedal with a fluid leak, it will cause the brake fluid to pour out. When the brake pedal comes back up, it will instead suck in air through the leak, which will cause your brake pedal to be very swampy.2. Faulty master brake cylinderMaster Brake CylinderAnother common cause of why your brake pedal is going to the floor when the engine is running is a bad master brake cylinder. The master brake cylinder is located behind the brake pedal on the other side of the engine bay?s firewall.The purpose of the master brake cylinder is to push brake fluid to the caliper pistons to reduce the vehicle?s speed.The master brake cylinder has a sealing around the pushing piston, and if that sealing starts to leak, the brake pressure will go back on the other side of the piston when you press the brake pedal.This will cause your brake pedal to always lose pressure when you press it, and this will feel like a swampy or sinking brake pedal.3. Faulty Brake BoosterBrake BoosterBetween the master brake cylinder and the brake pedal, you will find the brake booster. The brake booster uses a vacuum to increase the brakes? power when you touch the brake pedal.If you have even driven a car without a functional brake booster, you know how much pressure it requires without it.If your brake pedal starts to build pressure very low down, but it feels very stiff once it gets there close to the bottom, you most probably have an issue with your brake booster. It is not very common that the brake booster fails, but it happens on some car models.4. Air in the brake systemBleed Brake SystemDid you or someone else recently replace something in the car?s hydraulic brake system without performing a proper brake bleeding afterward? Then this may be your issue!Air is compressible, unlike brake fluid. Therefore, the brake system needs to be completely free from air in order to quickly build pressure and not get a swampy brake pedal.The only way to remove air from the brake fluid system is to bleed it properly. Here is a video of how you can bleed the brake system.5. Low Brake Fluid LevelRefill Brake FluidIf you have a brake fluid level warning light on your dashboard, it is definitely time to check the brake fluid level.If the brake fluid level is low, air can come into the brake system when you are taking sharp turns, for example. I talked about what happens with your brake system when you have air inside of it in the previous section.If your brake fluid is so low that air has come into the system, then there is not enough fluid left to refill it. You will have to bleed the brake system again."
How Do You Fix Brake Pedal That Goes to the Floor?	"Now that you know the common reasons why your brake pedal may be going to the floor, you probably want to know how to diagnose and how to fix this problem. So let?s begin.Look for external leaks: Check everywhere under your car for any signs of brake fluid leaks. Check the brake lines, hoses, and brake calipers. The most common leak is from rusty brake lines, but it can also come from bad rubber seals in the caliper pistons. Replace the leaking part.Check brake fluid level: Check the brake fluid level in the reservoir in the engine bay and refill to MAX if necessary. If the fluid level was really low, there might be air in the brake system, which means you have to bleed it.Bleed the brake system: The next step is to bleed the brake system to get all air out of it. You can find it in this video for the full process of how to bleed the brake system at home.Disconnect the brake booster?s vacuum hose: Disconnect the vacuum hose from the brake booster and try pressing the brake pedal again. If the problem still occurs, you most likely have a faulty master brake cylinder.Check or Replace master brake cylinder: Remove and inspect the master brake cylinder for any signs of damage to the seal. For most master brake cylinders, you can not buy the seal alone, so you have to replace the brake cylinder.Inspect or Replace Brake Booster: The last step is to inspect and replace the brake booster if you see something suspicious with it. However, if everything else seems fine and you are 100% sure there is no more air in the brake system, there is a big chance that the brake booster is the faulty part."
Why does my brake pedal go to the floor when I start my car?	"The most common reasons why your brake pedal goes to the floor when you start your car is because of a brake fluid leak, a faulty master brake cylinder, or a faulty brake booster."
How do you know if the master cylinder is bad?	"The easiest way to determine if the master brake cylinder is bad is to remove the brake booster?s vacuum hose. If the pedal is still sinking, it is most likely caused by a fluid leak, air in the system, or a faulty master brake cylinder. The only way to know for sure is to inspect the gasket inside of it visually."
How do I know if my brake booster or master cylinder is bad?	"Disconnect the vacuum hose from the brake booster. If the problem disappears when you press your brake pedal super-hard, you most likely have a bad brake booster. On the other hand, if the problem still occurs, you most likely have a bad master brake cylinder."
Why Does My Brake Pedal Go To The Floor After Bleeding?	"Sometimes this can happen if you didn?t perform the procedure properly. You need to close the air bleed screws before releasing the brake pedal; otherwise, air will get sucked into the system before you close the bleed valve."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Vacuum Brake Booster Check Valve ?	"The most common symptom of a bad brake booster check valve is a stiff brake pedal. You may also notice issues like trouble braking or a check engine light on your dashboard.Here?s a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing vacuum brake booster check valve to look for:1. Hard Brake PedalPush Brake PedalStepping on the pedal shouldn?t be difficult when everything is working as it should. If you push on the brake pedal and it is difficult to move, there could be a problem with the brake booster check valve.Typically, when the check valve becomes worn out, it will not hold the vacuum pressure inside the brake booster. The brake pedal will become firmer, requiring much more pressure to depress it. The reason this occurs is because the master cylinder contains more pressure inside due to a faulty check valve that is meant to ensure regulation. 2. Trouble BrakingIf the vacuum brake booster check valve has a small leak, it may result in not enough vacuum pressure in the brake booster and this will make the brakes much less efficient and it will require much more force to stop the vehicle.If it feels like the stopping distance of your car is much longer than usual it is definitely time to check your brake booster check valve.If it feels like the brakes are getting much worse recently after acceleration it is definitely a sign of a bad brake booster check valve.3. Check engine lightThe brake booster check valve is using vacuum pressure from the air intake to create vacuum in the brake booster system. This air is usually measured by the MAF sensor and if the check valve is leaking it will result in a loss of measured air. This will cause the car to run lean or rich depending on the engine type.When the car is running too lean or too rich this will result in a check engine light on your dashboard and a stored trouble code. You can use an OBD2 scanner to find any related air-fuel mixture trouble codes."
Brake Booster Check Valve Location ?	"Typically, the brake booster check valve is found on the brake booster. If you don?t see it there, it would be found in line with the vacuum hose. The vacuum booster is a dome-shaped component that?s mounted near the rear wall of the engine compartment. You should be able to find it on the driver?s side of the vehicle, running in line with your brake pedal. You can follow the vacuum hose running from the intake manifold on the engine to the vacuum booster. "
what are The Function of a Vacuum Brake Booster Check Valve ?	"The brake booster contains multiple parts, but one important aspect is the check valve. It takes vacuum pressure from the air intake when the engine is idling and creating a vacuum pressure in the brake booster.The check valve is a small part but vital to ensuring the proper link between the vacuum hose and brake booster. With a reliable check valve, the brakes can function as intended every time you stop on the pedal to stop. In general, the brake booster check valve should last the lifetime of the car. In fact, it doesn?t get inspected during a routine brake check and there is no maintenance to perform. With that said, the lack of attention means that when it breaks or fails, it isn?t noticed until symptoms occur. "
Brake Booster Check Valve Replacement Cost ?	"The cost to replace a brake booster check valve is between $70 and $85. In general, the labor costs will be around $30 and $45, while the parts should cost about $40. If you have some mechanical knowledge, replacing the brake booster check valve isn?t a complicated process. You could easily do it yourself with the right tools and save a little money. You would need to remove a few clamps and the vacuum hose to get to the check valve. However, there might be some other services that need to be performed at the same time. For example, if air got into the lines because of the defect, the brakes will need to be bled."
what are the Symptoms Of Worn or Bad Brake Pads ?	"The most common symptom of worn brake pads is grinding or squealing noises when braking. In many newer car models, you will also notice a wear indicator on your dashboard when the brake pads are worn. It can also cause a spongy brake pedal in some cases.Because of the importance of brake pads, there are a lot of symptoms that could occur. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of worn or bad brake pads to look for:1. Grinding or squealing noiseNoise From CarIf you hear a grinding or squealing noise when you press the brake pedal, it may be because the brake pads are completely worn out. This may be because when the brake pad material is completely gone. In this case, you will hear the metal plate on the brake pad press against the metal brake rotor.As you can imagine, metal against metal will cause a horrible noise. If you hear a horrible noise when you brake, it is definitely time to check your brake pads.2. Wear indicatorBrake Wear IndicatorMost newer cars have brake wear indicators when 2-3 mm or 0.04? to 0.1? left of the brake pad material. If you see a wear indicator on your dashboard, it is time to check your brake pads.The wear indicator wires and connectors can often cause the wear indicator to give false alarms on the dashboard, but it is worth checking.Most cars only have a wear indicator on the front brakes, though, while a few have it on both axles.3. Spongy Brake PedalBrake Pedal PushIf you feel that your brake pedal becomes spongy when you press the brake pedal, it may be caused by a bad brake pad. This can happen when parts come loose from the brake pad, and it will cause the brake pedal plate to bend when you press the brake pedal.To see damaged brake pads by parts that came loose, you often need to remove the brake pedals to inspect. Just a fast inspection from the outside might not be enough.4. Longer brake distanceLonger Brake DistanceIf the brake pads are worn to the metal plate, it will surely cause a much longer brake distance. This is because metal against metal doesn?t create the same amount of friction to stop your car.It can also be the case that parts of the brake pad come loose, and this will also cause less friction against the brake rotor.5. Scratches on the brake rotor surfaceBrake Rotor Scratch MarksIf you notice nasty scratches and a strange surface on the brake rotor, it could be because the brake pad is so worn that it goes to the metal plate.This is often very visible if you compare the surface against the other brake rotors of your car.The function of a brake padNew Brake PadsThe brake pads are made of steel and hard rubber. They are made to withstand a crazy amount of heat, dust, and other particles.They are installed between the brake caliper and the brake rotor. When you press the brake pedal, the brake pad is pushed against the brake rotor, which causes friction. This friction will cause your car to slow down and finally come to a stop.There are a lot of different materials in brake pads, depending on the manufacturer. Some are better than others regarding wear and brake distance."
How to check your brake pads ?	"Checking your brake pads in a car is often very straightforward. The thing you need is a flashlight. Point the flashlight inside of the rim against the brake rotor.Look for the part of the picture above and make sure there is at least 0,15? ? 0.2? or 4-5mm left of the brake pad; otherwise, it is time for a replacement.Some rims can make it difficult to inspect the brake pad from the outside. In this case, you should remove the wheel for an inspection.It is actually more common for the inner brake pad to wear out before the outer brake pads, so I strongly recommend removing the rim for an inspection, or checking it with a small mirror."
what are the Brake Pads Replacement Cost ?	"The average brake pad replacement cost is between $80 and $300, depending on the car model and labor costs. The brake pads cost $30?$100, and the labor costs $50?$250.The front brake pads are often more expensive than the rear ones. You also need to know that you might have to replace the brake rotors simultaneously as a brake pad replacement if they are bad.If you have an electric parking brake, you also need diagnostic tools to replace the rear brake pads.Brake pad replacement is often pretty straightforward, so if you have a little bit of knowledge, you can often do it yourself if it doesn?t have an electronic parking brake. Then you need a diagnostic tool to push back the pistons."
what are the Symptoms Of Bad Brake Drums ?	"The most common symptom of bad brake drums is noise from the car?s rear while braking. You may also notice reduced braking performance. If your parking brake feels loose and not engaging as it should, it could also be a sign.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of bad or worn brake drums to look for:1. Trouble StoppingCar Brake DistanceWhen you step on the brake pedal, you expect your vehicle to stop in a timely fashion. As the brake drums start to wear, this stopping time will gradually increase. If the car isn?t stopping as it once did, it could be an issue with either the drums or the brake shoes.However, your vehicle might come equipped with brake drums on the back wheels and discs on the front. In this case, it can be difficult to tell which set is going bad because both cause stopping issues when they are worn. 2. Brake NoiseNoise From CarWhen the brakes are operating normally, there should be no unusual sounds when you step on the pedal. However, the brakes become louder as they wear. Bad brake drums can no longer absorb the heat that is generated during braking. As the heat builds up, it causes additional stress on the brakes, leading to scraping noises when the shoes touch the drums. 3. Vibrating Brake PedalBrake Pedal PushAs the brake drums get worse, you will notice performance issues with the pedal as well. When you step down on the brake pedal to stop the vehicle, you might notice some vibrations. At first, you might not give it much thought, especially if no other symptoms have started yet.However, this early warning sign is attempting to get your attention. If you replace the brake drums now before the other problems occur, you can save yourself a lot of trouble and ensure maximum stopping power. 4. Loose Parking BrakePull Parking BrakeThe majority of vehicles use the parking brake with the back wheels. This is also where most brake drums are found. The parking brake counts on reliable brake drums to keep the vehicle secure when applied. If the drums are worn, they might not have the holding power needed to keep the vehicle in place. At first, you might notice a loose-feeling parking brake when you go to apply it. It can also feel like it slips slightly after being applied. "
Brake Drum Location? 	"The drum brakes can be found on rear wheels because that is where the parking brake is usually located. Brake drums are circular and made of metal. It?s also where the brake shoes are housed.The drum brakes turn with the wheel and are connected to the hubs. However, they are just one part of the complete drum braking system. A typical system contains brake shoes to press into the drums and a backing plate to hold everything together. The system also has the brake cylinder with the pistons attached and return springs that alter the position when the brakes aren?t applied. "
what are The Function of a Brake Drum ?	"When you push the brake pedal, the hydraulic brake fluid causes the pistons to push into the brake shoes. When this happens, the shoes push into the drums, causing the wheels to slow down and stop rotating. When you release the brake pedal, the return springs ensure that the shoes move back into their original position. This action allows the wheel to have free movement once again, without the shoes pressing into it. As the brake shoe surface wears down, the position needs to be adjusted. Otherwise, the shoes will have too far of a distance to travel when making contact with the brake drum. "
Brake Drum Replacement Cost	"The cost to replace brake drums is typically between $200 and $250. The parts alone are typically between $150 and $200, while the rest is spent on labor. If you can replace the drums yourself, you can save a small amount of money. Additionally, aftermarket drums cost less than many OEM versions unless you are upgrading to high-performance drums. Thankfully, drum brakes rarely require replacement and can often last 200,000 miles when used properly. You purchase brake drums individually or you can buy them as part of a kit, which includes the two-wheel set and the hardware needed for installation. If you are replacing the drum brakes on one side, it?s often advised to do the same on the other side. The problems that led to wearing on one side are probably causing wear to the other. It?s best to keep the performance of both drum brakes the same.If you replace the brake drums it is also very smart to replace the brake shoes and the cylinders at the same time."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad ABS Wheel Speed Sensor ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad ABS sensor are an ABS warning light on the dashboard, pulsating brake pedal, loss of anti-lock brakes, or loss of traction control. You may also notice other warning lights on the dashboard, such as the check engine light or traction control light.As you can see, there are actually not that many ways to tell if an ABS sensor has gone bad. This is mainly because the ABS control module will light up the ABS warning light and deactivate the system to prevent accidents.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing ABS wheel speed sensor to look for:1. Illuminated Warning LightsAbs LightYour dashboard contains a variety of important lights that alert you to danger. When the ABS wheel speed sensor fails, the ABS light is probably one of the first signs you will notice out of all the bad ABS wheel speed sensor symptoms. At first, it might simply cause the ABS warning light to come on. However, when the other systems stop functioning properly, you might also see the traction and stability control warning lights. In rare cases, defective ABS wheel speed sensors can cause the speedometer to stop registering. 2. Pulsating Brake Pedal while brakingPush Brake PedalThe ABS sensors measure the speeds of each wheel, and if one of the ABS sensors has gone bad, it will read the wrong speed on one or more wheels. This will cause the ABS control module to get tricked and thinking the car is sliding on a slippery surface.This will cause the ABS and traction control to kick in, and you will feel it by feeling a pulsating or pumping brake pedal while braking.3. Loss of Anti-lock BrakesAbs Brakes CarWhen an ABS wheel sensor fails, it causes the anti-lock brakes to be inoperable. Anytime a fault is noticed, the system triggers an alert, and the ABS warning light comes on.From here, the vehicle?s electronic control module stops receiving valuable data from the sensor. The computer relies on this information to determine if the wheels are locking up and require support. Because the system doesn?t know what are happening, the ABS shuts down until the repair is made. 4. Loss of Traction or Stability ControlTcs OffNot only can you lose anti-lock brakes, but also other functions, such as stability control, traction control, roll stability, and hill-start assist. When the sensor stops sending information, the computer shuts these systems down as well. However, you can experience problems even when the ABS light isn?t on. If you struggle to maintain traction in poor weather conditions or notice handling issues when you brake quickly, the ABS wheel speed sensor might be to blame. It could also be caused by damaged wiring connections running from the sensor to the ECM. "
ABS Wheel Speed Sensor Location ?	"The ABS wheel speed sensor is located at the wheel, behind the brake rotor, but some are placed directly on the axle. Each vehicle contains a different number of ABS wheel speed sensors. If the system contains four ABS wheel speed sensors, there will be one at each wheel behind the rotor. Systems with three sensors have one at each front wheel and another on the rear axle instead of at either of the rear wheels. The ABS type determines how many sensors the vehicle contains. Here are four ABS configurations.Two-channel, four-sensor ABS: One sensor is located on each wheel, but there?s a channel in the front and one for the rear. When any speed sensors detect a wheel lockup, ABS engages at that part of the vehicle.Three-channel, three-sensor ABS: There is one sensor located at each front wheel and one located on the rear axle. While the rear wheels are monitored at the same time, the front wheels are evaluated separately. Three-channel, four-sensor ABS: While there are sensors located at every wheel, the rear wheels run on one controller.Four-sensor ABS: One sensor is located at each wheel and monitored separately. This is the most common configuration with modern vehicles. "
ABS Wheel Speed Sensor Function ?	"The ABS wheel speed sensor can also be called an ABS brake sensor or, more plainly, an ABS sensor. Whatever it is called, it is a critical part of the ABS. The anti-lock braking system (ABS) is found on most new vehicles. ABS wheel sensors are attached to the wheels or axle to calculate the rotation speed of the wheels. Most ABS sensors contain a toothed ring and magnet that?s enclosed with a coil. Contact between the magnet and ring creates an electric field, which turns into the signal that is sent to the ABS controller. From here, the controller determines the speed of each wheel or axle. This information is then transmitted to the Engine Control Module (ECM).When the ECM sees that a wheel is locking up, the ABS is activated. It operates at such a fast speed that it often creates a grinding noise with a pulsating sensation.If the vehicle is also equipped with traction control, the ABS sensor helps control the movement of the vehicle in precarious situations. When traction is lost, the speed of one wheel will be different than the others, causing the system to kick in.The computer reduces the amount of braking force being applied to the wheel, causing trouble. When this force decreases, it allows the wheel to regain grip and rotate normally again. These same sensors run the stability control systems in modern cars as well. "
ABS Wheel Speed Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"The average ABS wheel speed sensor replacement cost is between $200 and $400 per sensor, depending on the car model and labor costs. You can expect to pay about $100 to $150 for the wheel speed sensor and another $100 to $300 for the labor. ABS wheel speed sensors on luxury vehicles can often cost more, plus some models can be harder to work on, which increases the labor cost. However, it?s not difficult to replace the ABS wheel speed sensor yourself with a few tools. If you have basic mechanical knowledge, this might be a project worth tackling in your home garage. They can become stuck after a while though, so you may need a heat source to remove them."
Can you drive with a bad ABS sensor?	"If your ABS sensor is faulty, it means that your car?s anti-lock braking system (ABS) won?t be working properly. You can technically drive with a bad ABS sensor, but it?s not recommended. Safety should always be your number one priority when driving, so if you have a bad ABS sensor, it?s best to get it fixed as soon as possible."
Can ABS sensors be cleaned?	"You can try cleaning the ABS sensor, but it is quite unlikely that it will solve the problem. Electrical problems and open circuits are the most common reason ABS sensors fail. However, if the ABS reluctor ring is very rusty, it can cause incorrect readings for the sensor."
What causes ABS sensors to go bad?	"There are a few things that can cause ABS sensors to go bad. One is dirt and debris accumulation on the sensor or in the connector. This can happen over time because the sensor is mounted in a very exposed area, especially if you live in an area with a lot of dust or dirt. Another possibility is corrosion, which can occur if water gets into the system. Finally, physical damage to the sensor itself can also cause it to fail."
Does the ABS sensor affect acceleration?	"Although it is quite unlikely, it?s not impossible. The ABS sensors are also used for the traction control system, and if a wheel gives the wrong wheel speed, it can reduce power to the engine as a safety feature."
Conclusion	"If your car is experiencing any of the ABS sensor symptoms above, but you feel like you don?t have the knowledge to diagnose it properly, it?s time to take it to a mechanic.Due to the fact that the ABS sensors are installed in an area exposed to water and dust, removing the old sensor can be difficult, and if you don?t have the knowledge, you may need some help from an experienced mechanic.However, if you have good experience working on cars, you may be able to replace the sensor yourself. Replacing an ABS sensor is usually not too expensive, but the exact cost depends on the make and model of your car."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Vacuum Brake Booster ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad brake booster are a stiff brake pedal and increased stopping distance. You can sometimes also hear a hissing noise coming from the engine at idle. A warning light on the dashboard could also show up.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing brake booster to look for:1. Stiff Brake PedalPush Brake PedalWhen you attempt to brake your car, you shouldn?t have to exert a lot of pressure. This is true except for when the vacuum brake booster goes bad.When this vital component fails, you will lose your braking assist. To get the vehicle to stop, you will have to put a lot of pressure on the brake pedal. 2. Increased Stopping DistanceCar Brake DistanceMost drivers have a good feel for how long it takes to stop the vehicle. If this time appears to be getting longer, something might be wrong.When braking assist functionality is lost, you need to put forth a lot more power to stop the car. This increased stopping distance might happen all of a sudden or subtlety, depending on how quickly the part fails. 3. Hissing NoiseCheck Noise Under Hood E1609791600132Brakes can make a variety of noises, from squealing to grinding, none of which are good. However, the distinct hissing sound belongs to a bad vacuum brake booster.When the vacuum-operated brake booster begins to leak, air escapes from the diaphragm or housing. This rush of air leads to a hissing sound that is most prominent when applying the brakes. 4. Dashboard Warning LightsCheck Engine Warning LightYour modern vehicle is set up with a multitude of sensors, alerting you when a problem occurs. The anti-lock braking system is no different.If you get an ABS warning on your dashboard, it could be a sign that something is wrong with the vacuum brake booster. Not only will your braking ability be affected, but you might also have issues with the traction and stability control systems, which have their own warning lights. "
what are the Vacuum Brake Booster Function ?	"The brake booster aids the driver when braking a vehicle. It drastically reduces the effort required by applying force to the master cylinder. The master cylinder is responsible for distributing fluid to the brakes for proper operation.There are three brake booster designs, with the vacuum-operated being the most popular. However, some vehicles include the hydro-boost or an electronic assembly model instead. In the vacuum brake booster, the internal diaphragm separates the two different sides. These compartments are referred to as the working chamber and vacuum chamber. As the brakes get released, you will find an equal amount of vacuum on both sides. However, when you apply the brake pedal, a control valve permits more pressure into the working chamber. The result of this operation is the activation of a pushrod that applies force to the master cylinder, thereby allowing brake assist to aid the driver?s efforts. "
Vacuum Brake Booster Location ?	"The vacuum brake booster is located between the firewall and the brake master cylinder. To replace the booster, you will need to remove the master cylinder as well. That?s why many people choose to replace both parts at the same time. The brake booster check valve can be found directly on the brake booster. If it isn?t there, it might be on the vacuum hose. However, some of these check valves are built directly into the vacuum hose and, therefore, not serviceable. If the check valve has gone bad, you might need to replace the vacuum hose assembly. "
what are the Vacuum Brake Booster Replacement Cost ?	"The average vacuum brake booster replacement cost is between $300 and $700, depending on the car model and labor costs. Labor will run between $100 and $200, while the parts are typically more than $150.However, there are several factors that affect how much you will pay, including what kind of vehicle you drive, how difficult it is to get to the brake booster and what other parts need to be replaced.Most vacuum brake boosters will last 150,000 miles or more, rarely going bad. However, vehicles that operate in dry climates might face more dry rot, which can lead to premature deterioration of the vacuum brake booster diaphragm and cause failure. If the vacuum brake booster fails, you should not continue driving your vehicle. In fact, you should never drive with any indication that something is wrong with your braking system. If your brakes are harder to operate and you are having difficulty stopping your vehicle, it?s time to have the system inspected by a qualified mechanic."
Is it safe to drive with a bad brake booster?	"No, it is not safe to drive with a bad brake booster. Cars made to have a brake booster will be very difficult to stop from higher speeds because the brake pedal will be very stiff without the brake booster."
Can a brake booster cause a soft pedal?	"Most often, a bad brake booster will cause a stiff brake pedal, but if there is an internal problem, it could potentially cause a soft pedal. When your brake pedal is soft, however, it?s more common to have a brake fluid leak or a bad master cylinder."
Can you repair a brake booster?	"Whether or not you can repair a brake booster depends on the problem. If it is a gasket that needs replacing, you can repair it if you find a gasket. The problem is finding spare parts for it because manufacturers usually sell the brake booster as a whole unit."
How long does a brake booster last?	"The brake booster is made to last the entire life of a car, and it is not very common for it to break in most car models. However, some car models have a lower-quality brake booster, and you may need to replace it once or twice during the life of the car"
 what are the Brake Fluid Leak Symptoms ?	"The main symptoms of a brake fluid leak include:Squishy Brake PedalNo Pressure in the Brake PedalPoor Braking PerformanceVisible Fluid LeakBrake Warning LightWhile these are the most common signs, it?s not all of them! Here down below is a more detailed list of the signs of a brake fluid leak to look for:1. Squishy Brake PedalBrake PedalAny time there?s air in the system, you?re going to have a brake pedal that feels squishy. When you have a brake fluid leak, you?re not just losing brake fluid every time you press the brakes, but you?re also sucking in air every time you let off the pedal.If you?re pressing the brakes and it doesn?t feel right, don?t ignore it and hope it goes away. Figure out what?s going on and make the necessary repairs straight away.2. No Pressure in the Brake PedalPush Brake PedalWhen you press the brake pedal, you should feel something ? if it sinks straight to the floor, you have a problem. While several conditions could cause this, if it worked fine the last time you got in your vehicle, chances are you have a massive brake fluid leak.Whatever you do, don?t drive your vehicle. If you don?t feel any pressure when you hit the brake pedal, you currently don?t have any brakes ? which means you won?t be able to stop as your driving.3. Poor Braking PerformanceLonger Brake DistanceThis might be the first thing that you notice if you have a brake fluid leak. When you hit the brakes, you expect to stop after a certain distance. But when your brake system has a leak, you?re not getting maximum braking pressure ? some of that pressure is escaping out through the leak.Moreover, you?re getting air and moisture in the system, which is negatively impacting your braking performance too. Add it all up, and you get a dangerous condition where your vehicle can?t stop like you?re expecting it to.4. Visible Fluid LeakCar Fluid LeakIf your vehicle has a leak, that means that fluid is going somewhere, right? If you have a brake fluid leak, you have a visible leak somewhere. The problem that brakes fluid leaks are incredibly hard to find. The fluid itself is mostly transparent, and there?s not that much brake fluid in the system to begin with.It?s not like oil or coolant leaks that you?ll likely notice by simply looking underneath your vehicle. You usually have to look for brake fluid leaks, but if you find one, you have a big problem you need to address right away.5. Brake Warning LightBrake Warning LightWhile you might expect that the brake warning light would pop on any time, you have a brake fluid leak, and the sad truth is that it doesn?t always work that way.The brake warning light will show up when the level in the brake fluid reservoir is too low. Remember that not all car models have this feature though, and if you have a big leak, you will have problems before the fluid goes low.But even small brake fluid leaks mean big problems, so you can?t rely solely on your brake warning light to keep you safe."
How to Diagnose a Brake Fluid Leak ?	"The best way to diagnose a brake fluid leak is through a visual inspection. You should start with the reservoir before inspecting the remaining components.While the brake fluid system is sealed, that doesn?t mean that anytime you see the fluid level in the reservoir drop, you have a problem. That?s because as the pistons in the brake calipers expand, the overall brake fluid level will drop too.But this drop should be gradual ? and you should always have some brake fluid there. Because of this, monitoring the brake fluid level is one of the best ways to make sure your vehicle doesn?t have a leak. If you know how quickly the brake fluid should drop, you?ll have a better idea of what an abnormal drop looks like.From there, the next best thing you can do is complete a visual inspection of all the brake components. This means everything from the master cylinder to the calipers at each wheel. You might need to jack up your vehicle to trace all the brake lines, but it?s worth it.If you have a brake leak, you will see it. Just make sure to check when your vehicle is dry and pump the brakes a few times before you start."
what are the Repair Costs to Fix a Brake Fluid Leak ?	"The average brake fluid leak repair cost is between $150 and $1,000. While that?s a vast range, it?s because there is a wide array of causes of a brake fluid leak.For instance, the cost to replace a brake line ranges anywhere from $150 to $200, while the cost to replace a brake booster can cost you anywhere from $600 to $800.Complicating the matter, even more, there?s no one cause that?s significantly more common than the rest. If you dive in an area with lots of salt on the road or by the coast with lots of salt in the air, you might experience rusted brake lines more frequently, but other drivers might find that they need to replace the master cylinder more often.Finally, because some jobs are easier to complete than others, you may or may not be able to rule out the labor costs. As an example, if you need to replace a brake line and can?t find the OEM replacement, the repair shop may need to make it. You likely don?t have the tools for this, even if you have the necessary expertise."
Can you drive with a brake fluid leak?	"No, you should never drive with a brake fluid leak, not even a small one. A brake fluid leak can result in the complete loss of your car?s braking ability, which is life-threatening for both you and other people on the road."
How do you stop a brake fluid leak?	"To stop a brake fluid leak, you need to replace or fix the leaking part. There is no anti-leakage additive you should use for the brakes. All work on the car?s hydraulic brake system should be carried out by a professional to prevent accidents."
Will brakes still work without fluid?	"No, without brake fluid, your brakes will not work. Brake fluid is essential for the operation of your brakes. It provides the necessary pressure to activate the brake pads and calipers, which in turn stops your car. If you don?t have any brake fluid in your system, your brakes will not be able to function properly."
Can you mix old and new brake fluid?	"If you only fill up your brake fluid, it is perfectly fine to mix old and new brake fluid. It is definitely better to replace the brake fluid completely, but in many cases it is not necessary. Just make sure you use brake fluid with the correct specifications for your car."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad ABS Reluctor Ring?	"The most common symptom of a bad ABS ring is an illuminated ABS light on the dashboard. You may also notice signs like a pulsating brake pedal while braking at lower speeds. If you drive on slippery surfaces, you may notice that there is no ABS function.You can experience many strange symptoms when one of the ABS rings starts to dysfunction. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing ABS reluctor ring to look for:1. ABS Light Comes OnAbs LightThe most obvious indication of a problem with the ABS system is that the ABS Light appears on your car?s dashboard. The ABS light could also be called a check engine light in some cars that do not have a separate indicator light for the ABS frame.The moment the light comes on is usually the main sign indicating that there could be a problem with your car?s ABS. You may have developed a problem with one of the sensors or a ring in the system.2. Brake Pedal Pulsating at Low SpeedsBrake Pedal PushYour car?s brake pedal can sometimes pulsate at low speeds or make a popping sound, just like when driving on ice. This means that your ABS is activated unnecessarily at low speed. This is a clear indication of a defective ABS ring.A defective ABS ring is not considered a fault by the system, which is why the ABS warning light does not light up at first, but rather only lights up when the system has completely switched off.On various occasions, it may even go on and off several times. A faulty ABS ring provides a false signal, which causes the car?s electrical control unit to start the anti-lock braking system just before the car stops or even switch it off completely, reducing control of the car and extending the braking distance.In most cases, you will only need to replace the ABS rings, and it is not necessary to completely replace the driveshaft and/or the joints.3. No ABS functionLong Brake DistanceDuring essential braking operations, the ABS should normally be activated to reduce the speed of the vehicle. Simultaneously, the loss of traction and skidding should be eliminated or reduced to an insignificant level.If you notice that the car needs more time to stop under overwhelming braking conditions or starts to skid and lose traction, this indicates a faulty ABS. This could be due to excessively corroded ABS rings or a cracked ABS ring sending a faulty pulse to the ABS control unit, interrupting the ABS braking process.This mostly happens if the ABS light has shown up on your dashboard, though, so be sure to repair the problem immediately if you see it.4. Sudden braking from nowhereAbs Braking Test E1610157977877Some cars do also have a braking function in the ABS control unit ? BMW, especially.With a brake system like this, the car can think that the car is skidding if an ABS toner ring is defective. This can cause the car to correct the skidding, which might be hazardous when the car is braking suddenly out of nowhere."
what are an ABS Reluctor Ring?	"The anti-lock braking system consists of a controller, a speed sensor, valves, and the ABS speed sensor toner ring.The system maintains the traction of the tires on the road, and the brakes? performance at high speeds is significantly improved.The ABS speed sensor ring is the main component of the entire system. It carefully monitors the speed of the wheels and transmits important signals that can alert the system electronically.If the brake is applied heavily, the extra force applied can lock the wheels using the brake discs, which can cause the car to skid on the road. This is very dangerous but is mitigated by the ABS ring function.The ring is used to detect the difference from the other wheels? speed and generate a signal to the controller. If the ABS ring fails, the controlled ABS receives incorrect readings."
ABS Ring Location ?	"The ABS Rings are usually located around the driveshafts or the wheel hubs on most car models.The front rings are often installed on the driveshafts if you have a front-wheel-driven car. Otherwise, you will most likely find them around the wheel bearings or wheel hubs.The rear rings are often located on the rear driveshafts if you have a rear-wheel-drive car, and around the wheel bearing/wheel hub otherwise. You can also find one ring inside of the differential on some rear-wheel-drive cars, instead of two separate rings.Furthermore, the quality is not much better than the front rings, which puts them in a more vulnerable state. If you have a 4?4 car, you will most likely find ABS rings on all drive shafts."
what are the ABS Ring Replacement Cost ?	"The average ABS ring replacement cost is between $60 and $300, depending on the car model and labor costs. An ABS Ring costs $10 to $50, and labor costs $50 to $250.The ABS rings themselves are often very cheap. The problem comes if there is no way to replace or buy just the ABS ring. You have to replace the whole driveshaft or whole wheel bearing and hub to replace the ABS ring in some car models. On these models, it will, of course, be much more expensive.The labor costs are sometimes even higher than the part itself, mainly because the replacement process requires removing wheels and many other parts, which can be time-consuming. But then it also depends on the technician and what he will charge you for it."
How do I check my ABS ring?	"You can visually inspect the ABS tone ring on most car models. Remove the wheel and look at the ABS ring while turning the wheel. Look for any cracks in the ring. If it is very rusty, you can gently brush the rust off with a wire brush. However, be careful not to damage the ring."
Can I  drive with a bad ABS ring?	"Although you can drive with a bad ABS ring, it is not recommended. When your ABS ring is bad, the ABS control module will struggle to know if your wheel is spinning or not and this can lead to problems when braking the vehicle. It can also cause the ABS function to disappear completely."
How long do ABS rings last?	"There is no fixed mileage or age for how long an ABS ring will last. ABS reluctor rings are made of metal and are placed in an area exposed to dirt, dust and water and this can cause them to go bad. Therefore, the lifespan of an ABS ring depends entirely on where you live and the roads where you drive your car."
Can I replace an ABS tone ring myself?	"Replacing an ABS tone ring can be a challenge for many car models. You may need to remove the drive shaft to replace the ABS ring and this job can be quite tricky, if you are not used to working on cars. Use a repair manual to learn how to do it, but be prepared that it can be a challenge."
why my car is Running Hot But Not Overheating ?	"Many of the same reasons the car runs hot and overheats will still apply. These include a bad thermostat, a clogged or defective radiator, a faulty coolant temperature sensor, a bad water pump, low coolant, air in the cooling system, a malfunctioning temperature gauge or a worn-out engine.Let?s take a look at these to figure out what?s going on with your car.1. Bad ThermostatCar ThermostatA main component of the cooling system is the engine coolant thermostat. This part is the gateway of the system, controlling the flow of coolant when the engine gets hot. If the engine is cold, the thermostat closes to keep the coolant from flowing. Once it gets hot, the thermostat opens for coolant to flow freely.Over time, the thermostat gets worn out and it can?t accurately measure the temperature. When this happens, it could open too late, allowing the engine to get hotter than it should. If the thermostat hasn?t completely failed yet, the engine might not overheat, but it could only be a matter of time. 2. Clogged or Bad RadiatorClogged RadiatorThe car radiator transfers heat away from the engine through a series of tubes. When hot coolant comes out of the engine, it circulates through the radiator to cool down. If a clog occurs or the radiator fails, the engine will get hotter. You may also notice coolant leaking or the color of the fluid could start to change. 3. Faulty Coolant Temperature SensorCoolant Temp SensorsThe coolant temperature sensor monitors how hot the liquid becomes. This measurement helps determine the air-fuel ratio since cooler engines require more fuel. When this sensor fails, the engine normally runs rich and it can also run too hot. You may also have a rougher idle or see black smoke coming from the exhaust. Furthermore, if the coolant temperature sensor runs the auxiliary fan in your car, it can fail, also leading to a hot engine. 4. Bad Water PumpWater Pump Replacement CostThe water pump is responsible for moving coolant from the radiator to the engine. Over time, the water pump will fail, normally giving warning signs first. When it stops operating efficiently, the engine tends to run on the hotter side. You may also see some coolant leaking from the pump or it could start to make a strange noise as it fails. 5. Low CoolantYour car must have the right amount of coolant for the engine to remain at the proper temperature. Engine coolant is a mixture of antifreeze and water. The antifreeze increases the boiling point of the water and keeps it from freezing when it?s cold. It also contains rust inhibitors to protect the engine. The ideal car temperature is between 195 and 220 degrees. When the coolant is too weak or there?s not enough, the heat won?t be absorbed properly as the liquid goes through the engine. You are then left with a hot motor. 6. Air in the Cooling SystemIn relation to the last problem, low coolant levels can also lead to air in the cooling system. It can also happen because of a blown head gasket or after a flush that wasn?t performed correctly.Either way, with air in the system, the coolant can?t flow properly and reduce the heat. It can also cause an airlock in the radiator.7. Bad Temperature GaugeFluctating Temperature Gauge E1609868224282Temperature gauges are reliable but also electronic, so they can fail. When the gauge itself is failing, it may start to act erratically. You may see the gauge jump up and down. The issue could also be a bad connection or defective wiring to the gauge, both of which should be inspected. 8. Overworked EngineIt?s possible that you are simply pushing the car too hard. If you are towing a heavy load, climbing a mountain or have packed the vehicle full of heavy cargo, you might be asking too much from it.You can also cause the car to run warm if it?s hot outside and you are sitting in traffic with the air conditioning on. Without the airflow through the radiator, the coolant can stay warmer than usual. "
How To Fix A Car That?s Running Hot But Not Overheating ?	"If you notice the temperature gauge going up but the engine hasn?t started to overheat, your quick action can prevent problems. Here?s what we would do as professional mechanics.1. Read Trouble CodesRead Trouble CodesEvery modern vehicle comes equipped with a diagnostic trouble code system that tells you when something is wrong. At the first sign of trouble with anything electronic, such as sophisticated thermostats, a code will be set in the system.You can read these codes with your compatible scanner. If you aren?t sure what the information means, take a look at our online trouble code library. 2. Check The Coolant LevelLow Coolant LevelThe next step is just as easy to do. Take a look at the coolant level and top it off if needed. Here are the steps you want to follow.Only check the coolant when the engine is cool.Look on the side of the coolant reservoir. There may be markings on the plastic showing you the levels. If the coolant reaches the ?Full? mark, you don?t have to do anything else. If it is below this mark, carefully remove the radiator cap.Add just enough of the coolant to top it off. Make sure you use the right coolant type and mixture for your vehicle or you could cause major damage. 3. Flush and Bleed Coolant SystemTo get any air out of the cooling system, you need to bleed it.Take off the radiator cap after the engine is cool.Insert a funnel into the radiator.Fill the radiator up with as much coolant as you can. Make sure you use the right kind.Once the coolant is stable and not moving, start the vehicle.Turn on the heat to its hottest setting and the fan on low. As the coolant levels drop, top off the system again.Confirm that there is heat coming from the cabin vents.Watch the temperature gauge to ensure the engine doesn?t overheat. Once the radiator is completely topped off and not going down anymore, shut off the engine and put the cap back on. Drive the vehicle to ensure the car doesn?t overheat.Once the system is cooled back down, confirm that there?s still enough coolant. Top off if needed. If it was time for a coolant change anyway, you could also flush the system. This requires you to drain out the old fluid and refill it. 4. Measure The Coolant Temperature SensorWith a multimeter, you can test the coolant temperature sensor. The sensor is usually located next to the thermostat.It?s best to reference your factory service manual when checking these readings. If you get anything other than what?s recommended by the manufacturer, you may choose to replace the sensor. 5. Diagnose Thermostat and Coolant FlowStart the vehicle and let it idle. Look through the radiator filler neck to see if there?s any coolant flowing. You shouldn?t see anything flowing at first because the engine hasn?t reached its operating temperature. If it is flowing, the thermostat valve is stuck open.If it?s not flowing, continue letting the engine run until it reaches optimal temperature. Look through the radiator filler neck again and the coolant should be flowing. If not, the thermostat is in a stuck closed position and the temperature will continue to rise. 6. Contact A ProfessionalWorking with the car?s cooling system is no easy task. Even with all of the experience we have, we still find some aspects of it to be complicated and confusing.If you are unsure what to do or you would rather not deal with the repair yourself, talk to your local auto technician. Sometimes, it?s best to trust the professionals, especially since an overheated engine can lead to massive repair bills. "
Why is my car running hot all of a sudden?	"A mechanical failure might have occurred. Check the thermostat, radiator, coolant temperature sensor, water pump and temperature gauge. It could also be low coolant or air in the system. Otherwise, you might simply be overloading your car engine and expecting too much from it. "
How do I know if my thermostat is stuck open?	"If the thermostat is stuck open, you will see coolant flowing past the radiator fill neck even before the engine reaches its operating temperature. The engine probably won?t reach that temperature easily because of the flowing coolant. You probably won?t get any heat from the vents, either."
Why is my temperature gauge fluctuating but not overheating?	"It?s possible that the temperature gauge is broken. Otherwise, it could be due to a bad thermostat, radiator, coolant temperature sensor or water pump. If not, consider that there?s air in the system, too little coolant or you have pushed the engine too hard. "
Why does my car run hot and then go back to normal?	"It?s possible that you are pushing the car beyond what it?s capable of or there?s not enough coolant. You may also have air in the cooling system or be facing a mechanical failure, such as a bad thermostat, radiator, coolant temperature sensor, water pump or temperature gauge. "
Conclusion	"It?s important to keep a close eye on the temperature gauge of your car, but not everyone does. By recognizing trouble with the operating temperature early on, you have a better chance of preventing a problem. As you watch the temperature gauge, you will have become more accustomed to what it should look like, so you can tell when something?s abnormal. If you aren?t sure what you are looking at, there?s no harm in getting a second opinion. When your engine overheats, it can cause serious damage. If you need to have the engine replaced, you are looking at thousands of dollars. For that reason alone, all temperature issues should be taken seriously if you want to avoid these costly repairs."
what are the Causes Of Car Overheats When AC is On ?	"If the car only overheats when the air conditioning is on, the engine load might be too high. You could also have mechanical issues, such as a failure with the condenser, an overloaded compressor, a defective temperature sensor, or a bad fan. Otherwise, it might just be an incompetent AC system.Here is a more detailed list of why your car overheats when the AC is on.1. Increased Engine LoadEngine LoadYour car?s engine is only able to handle so much. If you are pushing your car beyond its limits, the motor can start to overheat. Running the air conditioning adds to the load that?s put on the engine. If you do this in conjunction with towing heavy loads up steep inclines, the temperature may slowly climb.If you?ve ruled out any mechanical failures, you may want to look at how you are using your vehicle. It?s very possible that you are expecting too much from the car you have. 2. Condenser Installed In Front Of RadiatorAc Condenser LocationWith the condenser in front of the radiator, cool air can be stolen from where it needs to go. Without enough cold air in the radiator, it becomes more difficult to keep the engine temperature down.Additionally, condenser failure is always possible. Dirt and contaminants tend to build up in the fins of the condenser. When the fins become clogged, heat transfer doesn?t occur as efficiently. 3. Incompetent Cooling SystemIf there?s nothing wrong with the condenser, you may just have an incompetent cooling system. A faulty water pump can often be blamed. When the water pump stops working as it should, heat can?t be dissipated well. It?s also possible that there?s not enough coolant in the tank for proper cooling function. In other situations, a lack of AC refrigerant could be putting more stress on the system than what?s needed. 4. Overloaded AC CompressorAc Compressor CarWhen the AC is on, the compressor puts additional load on the engine. You can see this by watching your RPMs when you turn on the AC.If the compressor seizes or the accessory belt stops turning, failure can occur. Very quickly, the engine starts to overheat. 5. Bad Radiator FanThe cooling fan is required to keep the temperature down. If the cooling fan fails, the engine is going to overheat. However, you may not notice it as much when you are driving down the highway because the car?s speed keeps air flowing.It?s going to be most noticeable when you are stuck in traffic and running the AC. It can also happen if you start to drive slower and the radiator can?t get the air it needs. 6. Defective Engine Coolant Temperature SensorThe engine coolant temperature sensor is responsible for letting the control module know when the cooling fans should be turned on. If this fails, the engine could overheat.When the temperature sensor doesn?t send the right signal, coolant doesn?t flow as it should. This situation can get even worse if you are using the AC and putting an excessive load on the engine. "
How To Fix A Car That Overheats When AC is On ?	"Once the car begins overheating, you want to diagnose the problem immediately. It?s important to keep the engine from overheating because permanent damage can quickly occur. Here are a few steps to help you figure out what?s going on. 1. Check Coolant LevelCheck CoolantBefore you go through any extensive steps, it?s best to start with the coolant level. It?s very possible that you just need to put a little more in. Only check the coolant when the vehicle is cool. Hot liquid is pressurized and can lead to damage.Locate the coolant reservoir. It?s under the hood, typically on the front or side of the engine.If the reservoir is transparent, you should be able to see the levels on the side. There should be a ?Cold? and ?Hot? line imprinted on the side.With the engine cool, the liquid should reach the Cold line. If not, you need to add more coolant.Take the cap off and add the right antifreeze mixture for your vehicle. If the coolant is low, you must also examine the system for leaks. Over time, gaskets, seals and hoses can all become worn out, allowing fluid to seep out. It?s important to fix these leaks before adding more fluid, or you will end up in the same boat later. 2. Make Sure the Radiator and Condenser are Not DamagedDamaged Radiator FinsNext, you want to perform a check of the radiator and condenser. Here are some tips to consider.Use a flashlight. It can be dark around the radiator tank. Inspect the radiator and condenser for any wet spots. This problem indicates seepage and damage.Look at the radiator core for any signs of leaks.Inspect the upper and lower hose clamps on the radiator. Tighten them if necessary.Check the fins of the radiator and condenser and ensure they are not clogged or damaged.Open the oil dipstick to ensure there?s no coolant leaking into the motor. If you notice any damage, have it repaired right away. For the cost of a radiator or condenser, you can save yourself from a much higher bill than with an engine replacement. 3. Inspect the Radiator/AC Condenser FanMost of today?s radiators have an electric fan. With these fans, you can use a multimeter to test operation.Turn off the car engine.Locate the fuse box. Normally, it?s under the dash.Set the multimeter to DCV (Direct Current Voltage). Select the range that?s best for the 12V circuit.Put the negative multimeter lead to the negative battery terminal post.Connect the red multimeter lead to the fuse contact for the radiator fan. If the reading is around 12V, the fuse is fine. Otherwise, a blown fuse will give you a 0V reading on one side. A 0V reading on both contacts means there?s no power coming to the fuse either. Aside from a blown fuse, the fan may also not be working because there?s something holding it up. Physically inspect the fan for any debris holding it up and clean it out when appropriate.4. Refill and Diagnose the AC SystemIf a lack of AC refrigerant could be to blame, refill it. You want the AC system working its best to reduce the load on the engine. Aside from this, you want to fix any mechanical issues you?ve found. Remember to reference your car?s service manual for the proper steps for your vehicle. 5. Connect an OBD ScannerIf there are warning lights on the dashboard, your code scanner can help you figure out what?s wrong. Plug your compatible OBDII scanner into the port under the steering wheel. It should reveal a code or codes that can be used to determine the problem. Reference the information you receive with our online trouble code library to fix the issues. 6. Contact a ProfessionalNot everyone understands the basics of the cooling system and that?s okay. If you aren?t sure where to start, reach out to a local mechanic for more help.Even if you can figure out what?s wrong, there could be times when the issue is over your head or you don?t have the equipment needed. There?s no shame in getting some help to ensure the fault is repaired properly. "
 Can a bad AC compressor cause a car to overheat?	"The compressor isn?t going to cause a direct fault that overheats the engine. However, when the compressor clutch engages without proper operation, there will be an extra strain on the engine. This problem can quickly lead to an overheating engine. "
Can an overcharged AC cause an overheating engine?	"When the air conditioning system is overcharged, the compressor can fail. Any damage to the compressor can put extra strain on the engine. If it?s not repaired right away, the engine may start overheating because of the stress. "
Does the car AC make the engine hotter?	"The air conditioner does put additional load on the engine. If the engine is already prone to overheating, having to work harder may throw it over the edge. In some cases, you can stop the engine from overheating simply by turning off the air conditioner. "
Does turning off the AC prevent overheating?	"If there?s a failure in the cooling system, the AC system isn?t going to make a difference or change the problem. However, you can reduce the load on the engine by turning off the AC. This simple change may give you a little more time to drive home without overheating the motor. "
Conclusion	"At the first sign of an overheating engine, you want to take action. Your quick attention can make the difference between fixing a small mechanical problem and having to replace the engine. Wouldn?t you rather add a little coolant or replace a small part versus giving up your vehicle for the engine to be rebuilt?Our guide provides you with the simple steps to work through the overheating issue. Whether it?s related to the air conditioner or not, you should be able to get back on the road quickly. "
what are the Causes of a Cold Lower Radiator Hose ?	"The most common reasons why your lower radiator hose is cold are a faulty thermostat, a bad water pump, or a low coolant level. It can also be caused by airlocks or a clogged coolant system.Here is a more detailed list of the six most common causes of a cold lower radiator hose:1. Faulty thermostatThermostat Location E1609868130278This is the most common problem when it comes to a cold lower coolant hose. Engines have a valve-based thermostat that determines and regulates coolant inflow so that the engine operates at an optimal temperature and does not overheat.If your car is overheating and at the same time won?t heat the lower coolant hose, you most likely have a problem with your thermostat, which needs to get replaced.The thermostat should be closed when the engine is cold and not running. Regulation of water by the thermostat prevents engine hot spots. Once the optimal temperature has been reached, the coolant water will be let into the radiator for energy dissipation.If the thermostat is not opening at this time, it may cause the lower radiator hose to stay cold, and at the same time, overheat the engine.2. Faulty Water PumpCar Water PumpThe water pump?s job is to pump coolant from the engine block towards the radiator to chill the coolant.If the water pump is not functioning properly, the water will stand still in the engine, and no water will get pumped to the radiator.The lower coolant hose is most likely the coolant output side of your engine, which means that the hose will stay cold.3. Low Coolant LevelLow Coolant LevelA low coolant level can create a lot of problems in the coolant system. A low coolant level may create air pockets in the coolant system and may be causing the water pump to stay in an air pocket.The coolant level is super easy to check, so open your hood and read your car manual to find the coolant reservoir. Remember never to open it when the engine is hot, though, as it is boiling and will splash everywhere if you open it.4. Air in the Coolant systemBleeding Coolant SystemAir pockets in the coolant system are something you really do not want to have there. Air pockets can cause overheating and may stop the circulation from working properly.It may also create an air pocket around the water pump, making it so that it can?t pump water anywhere.Air in the coolant system can result from a faulty head gasket, or a poorly done coolant fluid change. If you know that you recently changed the coolant, you need to bleed the system properly.Air in the coolant can also have been caused by a too low coolant level.5. Clogged Coolant SystemClogged Coolant SystemIn some rare cases, the coolant system can get clogged. This is not very common, though, because the main coolant pipes are pretty big. However, if someone ran your car without coolant and just water, it could have created a lot of rust inside the engine.This, together with a leaking head gasket, can create a lot of mess inside the coolant system. Try to flush the coolant system if you have tried everything else.6. No problem at allNo Car ProblemIn many cases, when it comes to a cold lower radiator hose, there is actually no problem at all! The engine needs to be really hot and almost overheat before the thermostat lets the coolant pass by.If your car is not overheating, but the lower coolant hose is cold when you feel it, it may just mean that it is not hot enough, and therefore there is nothing wrong with your engine."
Should both radiator hoses be hot?	"Both upper and lower radiator hoses should be hot when the engine runs at operating temperature. This means the coolant flow through the radiator is sufficient, preventing the engine from overheating. The only situations when radiator hoses should be cold are while the engine is warming up or, in some cases, when cruising when it?s cold outside. This is because the thermostat will be closed before reaching a certain temperature, preventing coolant flow."
Why is my car radiator hot at the top and cold at the bottom?	"This is because the hot coolant coming from the engine will enter the radiator at its top side. And while making its way down, the coolant will get cooled down by an air stream flowing through the radiator?s core. As a result, a good radiator will always be cooler at its bottom than at its top end."
Should upper and lower radiator hoses be at the same temperature?	"If the car?s cooling system is functioning correctly, the lower radiator hose should be colder than the top one. When the coolant enters the radiator at its top end and passes through its core, its temperature will go down. But because both radiator hoses are still very hot, you?ll hardly be able to notice the difference just by hand. Instead, you?ll need an infrared thermometer or a similar device."
Is the lower radiator hose supposed to be soft?	"Once the engine reaches its running temperature, the lower radiator hose, like the upper one, should feel firm when you squeeze it. The cooling system operates at a certain pressure, which is, for most cars, 10 PSI or more. This increases the coolant?s boiling point and makes the engine?s operation more efficient."
Why is my radiator half hot and half cold?	"A radiator will be half hot and half cold when it?s clogged up with dirt buildups. When this happens, the coolant will only flow through a portion of its core, reducing the cooling effect. While a car with such a radiator may run fine under moderate loads, it will quickly overheat once it needs to put in more effort. This usually happens when driving uphill for longer or when towing a trailer."
Conclusion	"The car?s cooling system controls the engine?s temperature and prevents it from overheating. Its components include the coolant pump, thermostat, and radiator, among other things. Additionally, there are several pipes and rubber hoses connecting all these together. The cooling system has several common failure points, with a clogged radiator being one of them.This usually happens in high-mileage cars or those that have been neglected. The coolant flow through such radiators will not be sufficient, which leads to overheating, especially under heavy loads. If it is clogged up with dirt buildups, the radiator will be half hot and half cold."
How Much Coolant Loss Is Normal?	"If there?s nothing mechanically wrong with the cooling system, you could still notice a slight dip in coolant levels over time. In fact, it?s normal to notice up to 0.25% less coolant after six months. That equates to about two or three ounces each year. If you notice more than this when you check the levels, you are probably dealing with a leak somewhere. Instead of simply topping off the system, you should have it inspected to head off any potential damage. "
Does Coolant Evaporate?	"Coolant doesn?t evaporate because it sits inside a closed system. Within the closed loop construction of the cooling system, coolant is unable to evaporate. If you notice that the coolant levels have decreased slightly over time, it?s probably not the coolant that?s evaporating but the water that?s included in the mixture. Most antifreeze mixtures are 50% coolant and 50% water. Of these, the water in the mixture is going to evaporate first, even if it?s just very small amounts and it?s more likely that your car have a leak if you see a declining level. "
Causes Of Coolant Loss ?	"There are numerous issues that can lead to leaking coolant, all of which are going to be mechanical failures on some level. However, the degree to how bad the fault is can range from a minor issue to something catastrophic.Here are the top four reasons coolant may leak from your car. 1. External Coolant LeakCoolant Leaking E1609789888621There are many parts of the cooling system that can fail and lead to a leak. For example, if the radiator cap gets damaged or the seal wears out, a leak can occur from this point. Radiator hoses are another component that can fail and leak. Beyond this, you may have a problem with the radiator that is causing a leak. Using too much water with the coolant can lead to an increase in corrosion and rust. These cooling system parts are also known for simply wearing out over time. 2. Blown Head GasketIf coolant levels are dropping, the last thing you want to hear about is a blown head gasket. This would be the worst-case scenario. When the head gasket becomes damaged, coolant and oil can mix. What results from this defect is a cracked engine block or cylinder head failure that also causes white smoke to come from the exhaust. Because of the complexity of this repair, it?s not always worth fixing in an older car. 3. Leaking Heater CoreOne part that often goes overlooked is the heater core. Coolant is supposed to provide corrosion resistance to the heater core, but these can often become depleted, leaving the system vulnerable.If coolant begins leaking from the heater core, the levels are going to drop and the engine could overheat. Additionally, you might notice a sweet smell inside the cabin and it becomes difficult to heat the car. 4. Internal EGR Cooler LeakThe EGR cooler is an integral part of the exhaust and emissions systems, but it?s also prone to failure. If there?s an internal leak with the EGR cooler, you are going to notice coolant coming from the exhaust. It will also create white smoke. In most cases, this problem would also cause the Check Engine Light to come on. Plus, your coolant level will continue dropping until you resolve the issue. "
How To Fix Coolant Loss ?	"Whatever is causing the coolant to leak, it?s possible to fix it. In some cases, you may be able to diagnose and fix the problem yourself, while other times, you might need more support. Follow these guidelines to get back on the road without leaks. 1. Find And Repair Coolant LeaksBefore you can take steps to stop the leak, you must first find it. The easiest way to spot a coolant leak is if there?s external dripping. You can take a large piece of cardboard and place it under the vehicle at night. By the morning, there should be an indication of coolant on the cardboard, helping you determine where it might be coming from.Perform a visual inspection underneath the vehicle to see what?s leaking. You want to look closely at all of the hoses and clamps, as these are places wear occurs first. You should also inspect the radiator and other cooling system components to determine what needs to be fixed. 2. Test Head GasketBad Head GasketIt?s not simple to test for a blown head gasket. For this reason, many people choose to look at the symptoms to see if a head gasket failure is probable first. For example, when the head gasket is to blame, you will see either coolant in the oil or vice versa. There should also be white smoke coming from the exhaust.If the signs lead to a blown head gasket, you can take the diagnostics to another level. However, it?s not wise to take these steps unless you know what you are doing because it is dangerous. Here are some general steps to follow, with extreme caution.Warm up the car engine.Turn off the car and remove the radiator cap carefully. Put a funnel in the place of the radiator cap.Start the engine again.Watch the coolant circulate. If there are a lot of bubbles, the gasket might have failed. Because hot coolant can spray from the radiator during this procedure, you may not feel comfortable doing it yourself. If so, please move on to step number four. 3. Use A Cooling System SealerCoolant Leak SealerIf you have a leaky radiator, hose or gasket, you may be able to temporarily use a cooling system sealer or radiator sealer to buy some extra time. These products add a chemical to the walls of the system to cover up any tiny holes that exist. It?s not difficult to use these products and they don?t cost a lot. Here are a few basic steps to keep in mind.Buy a high-quality radiator sealant. You don?t want to purchase a no-name brand. Instead, spend a little extra for a product that will work.Dump the contents into the radiator. Make sure you follow the directions on the label showing you how much to use. Typically, an entire bottle will be required.Add coolant if the levels are low. Aside from this, there?s no reason to drain or add any coolant if the levels are already within normal range. Start the engine. Warm it up and let the sealant circulate. It?s best to keep the engine running for ten minutes. Don?t drive overnight. Once you have performed the steps outlined, let the car sit overnight. Ideally, you won?t drive the car again for about 12 hours, so the sealant can set. Sealants are not a replacement for repair. Using a high-quality sealant might buy you a little bit of time, but you should still have the cooling system inspected and repaired. 4. Contact A ProfessionalIf at any point during these steps you feel overwhelmed, you would do better reaching out to an auto repair shop. Cooling system issues aren?t always easy to diagnose or repair, so don?t take chances if you don?t feel qualified. For example, repairing a blown head gasket is a difficult job that few people have the tools to handle on their own. For this reason, you will want to get more guidance.The price you pay for repair from an auto shop depends on several factors. The price is variable based on what type of car you drive, the location of the shop and what needs to be fixed. In most cases, it shouldn?t take more than an hour or two for the mechanic to determine what the problem is unless it?s complicated. "
How Often Do You Need To Top Off Coolant?	"Coolant levels should be checked often and topped off whenever they are low. If the coolant is persistently low, you should have the system checked. Otherwise, most automakers recommend changing the coolant every 60,000 miles or four years, whichever comes first. Check the maintenance schedule for more guidance. "
Can You Lose Coolant Without A Leak?	"If the coolant level drops on its own, it should be so minimal it would be difficult to see. Coolant isn?t prone to evaporation because it operates within a closed system. More likely, you are dealing with a cooling system leak if the coolant levels continue to drop. Have the system inspected and repaired. "
Why Am I Losing Coolant But No Leaks?	"If the coolant levels are dropping, but you can?t find a leak, it?s probable that an internal leak is occurring. With a blown head gasket, the coolant could be leaking into the combustion chamber, mixing with the car?s oil. This is a serious condition that should be dealt with immediately. "
Should I Worry About A Small Coolant Leak?	"If the leak is minimal, you might think it?s okay to keep driving for now. First, leaking antifreeze is dangerous to children, pets and the environment. Aside from that, a small leak can quickly turn into something major. If a hose blows while you are driving, you could lose all of the coolant and the engine could overheat, all without any warning. "
Is It Ok To Top Up Coolant With Water?	"When the coolant level is slightly low, you might be tempted to simply add some water, but you shouldn?t. The antifreeze must contain the right mixture of coolant and water to protect the system adequately. Diluting the system with water only lowers the boiling point and makes it less efficient. The only time water should be used is in an absolute emergency. Even so, you want to replace it with the appropriate mixture as soon as you can. "
Conclusion	"Taking care of the cooling system should always be a top priority if you want your car to provide many miles of service. When coolant levels are low, you want to know what?s going on and figure out how to fix it fast. Knowing how much coolant loss is normal helps you determine whether or not you have a problem on your hands. In most cases, any drop in coolant indicates an issue.As with all major automotive systems, we highly recommend prevention, which can head off issues. By following recommended maintenance on the cooling system, you avoid failures and leakage. Still, there are times when a failure occurs, even with diligent maintenance. To ensure no other damage occurs, have the leaking system repaired immediately. Otherwise, you could deal with a blown head gasket or overheating engine due to neglect."
Is It Bad To Have Rust In The Coolant?	"There should never be rust in the coolant of your car. If you see rust, you know that there?s something wrong that requires your attention. Rust indicates that corrosion is occurring within the cooling system.These rust particles start to accumulate until the passages become blocked. When coolant can?t pass through the engine as intended, permanent damage can occur. For this reason, you want to deal with corrosion at its first indication. With that said, people can see a brown substance in the coolant and assume it?s rust when it?s something else. It?s important to discern if you are simply looking at old, contaminated coolant or if there are actual rust particles. Either way, the solution would be the same. What would be most concerning is if the brown color was actually oil that infiltrated the cooling system. This problem would require a much larger repair. "
What Causes Rust in the Coolant?	"Rust can be caused by something simple such as not enough antifreeze or something more mechanical, such as air in the system. Either way, it?s important to deal with the problem immediately to ensure the cooling system remains operational. Here are the four more common causes leading to rust showing up in the engine coolant. Most of these issues are completely preventable. 1. Lack Of Antifreeze MixYour car?s cooling system is designed with metal materials. The coolant ensures that water doesn?t infiltrate these parts and cause rusting. It acts as a barrier. However, if you aren?t using the right amount of coolant in the system, condensation and moisture can occur. Once it begins, the metal is susceptible to rust and corrosion. Additionally, without the right amount of antifreeze, the engine can start overheating, leading to even bigger problems. 2. Bad Antifreeze ProductThere are varying types of antifreeze products on the market. For the same reason, you only choose one type of oil for your engine, it?s important to put the proper coolant in the car. You can figure out the appropriate type and ratio by examining the owner?s manual. With most formulas, you need to mix the coolant 50/50 with water. There are also pre-mixed formulations available to buy, but it doesn?t normally make sense to purchase water when you can mix it yourself. When the coolant gets low, some people will pour straight water into the reservoir. This practice can also lead to rusting. Water without coolant included leads to oxidation and corrosion. Rust can build on the water pumps, pipes, impellers and anything else that?s metal. 3. Not Maintained ProperlyAs with all fluids in the car, there?s an appropriate time to change it out. You may be used to getting regular oil changes, but the coolant is just as important. If you allow old coolant to circulate through the system, it won?t be able to protect the vital components any longer.Not only can the metal parts start to corrode, but old coolant can lead to the failure of seals and hoses. Any problem that leads to a lack of circulation could cause the engine to overheat, which is bad news. Most manufacturers recommend having the coolant changed every 30,000 miles or two years, whichever comes first. However, there are some newer cars that are going longer than this, so it?s important to check the maintenance schedule set for your vehicle. 4. Air Getting Into The Cooling SystemThe cooling system is meant to remain sealed. When it is working as it should, there will be no air trapped within the components. However, various malfunctions can allow air into the system. Trapped air allows more water to build up in the system, which, you already know, leads to rust. "
How to Remove Rust From the Coolant?	"Once you?ve confirmed the presence of rust, it?s time to take action. Even if you don?t have a lot of mechanical experience, it?s not difficult to follow these three steps. However, if these seem to be too much for your level of knowledge or the tools you have, reach out to a mechanic instead.1. Fix Coolant Leaks And Drain FluidFirst, you want to diagnose and find any coolant leaks. After you ensure no coolant leaks, you need to drain the old coolant from the vehicle. With a drain pan, open the cap and allow the coolant to flow out. Once the coolant has stopped flowing, you can transfer it to an old antifreeze jug. Take it to your local auto parts store for recycling. Don?t put old bottles of antifreeze in the trash or pour them out. 2. Flush The Cooling SystemDraining the cooling system isn?t enough to get rid of the existing rust. You will also need to flush out the system with water.Double-check how much water is needed and make sure you use an appropriate amount of pressure. The water should force out any leftover debris or rust. 3. Fill System With A Good Antifreeze ProductWith the system completely flushed out, you are ready to refill it. However, you must be careful what products you choose.Make sure you get the appropriate coolant for your engine type. You may also consider using a rust inhibitor product to help prevent future problems. With the system refilled, it?s important to remove any air by bleeding the system. Otherwise, you could allow air into the system, which puts you back in the same boat. Additionally, you need to double-check how much coolant is in the reservoir and top it off as needed. "
How to Prevent Rust in Coolant From Forming?	"Since you know how rust is formed in the coolant, you will likely figure out some practical ways to keep it from occurring. Either way, we have some steps that will keep the cooling system running at optimal levels. Here are a few of our best tips.Check coolant levels frequently. If it needs to be topped off, fill it with the appropriate fluid. Change the coolant at regular intervals. Check the manufacturer?s guidelines to determine when the coolant should be changed or flushed.Do not mix different types of coolant together.Don?t add water to the system beyond what are called for in the mixture. You should never pour straight water into the cooling reservoir.If you notice any defects with the coolant or something doesn?t seem right, you should get help from a qualified mechanic. A little bit of prevention can keep you from dealing with bigger repair bills in the future. "
Where Does Rust In Coolant Come From?	"Rust occurs when there?s not enough antifreeze in the system to protect the metal parts. It also occurs when water infiltrates the system beyond what should be used with the coolant. In more extreme cases, it can be caused by poor maintenance or air getting trapped in the system. "
Can Rusty Coolant Cause An Overheating Engine?	"A small amount of rust shouldn?t cause the engine to overheat, especially if it is dealt with immediately. However, as the rust builds up, it can start to block passageways that keep the coolant from flowing. Without the right amount of coolant, the engine will start to overheat, leading to permanent damage."
Why Is There Brown Stuff In My Coolant?	"Degraded coolant can start to look brown, especially if it hasn?t been changed regularly. What?s worse is if there?s rust in the coolant, leading to the brown color. Rust can be a sign of internal damage that must be dealt with immediately to ensure the cooling system?s integrity. There?s also the chance that oil has infiltrated the cooling system, which leads to its own set of problems. "
Does A Radiator Flush Remove The Rust?	"When you flush the radiator, you remove any rust pieces that are floating around. It will push out any loose pieces so they don?t get lodged in the system. However, there could already be wear that is irreversible, which is why you still want to keep a close eye on the efficiency of the cooling system. "
How Much Does A Coolant Flush Cost?	"If you prefer your own coolant flush, you will only need to pay for the cost of supplies. You may already have a drain pan, so buying the coolant is all that?s needed. If you prefer to pay for a professional cooling system flush, expect to pay between $100 to $200, based on what type of car you drive and where you live. "
Conclusion	"Coolant rust can be caused by a lack of antifreeze or the wrong combination being used. It also occurs when you don?t maintain the cooling system properly or if there is air in the system. Either way, you need to resolve the problem quickly before catastrophic failure occurs.By keeping a close eye on your vehicle, you know there?s a problem before it turns into something major. With proper maintenance and regular inspections, you can prevent rust in the coolant. Even if you miss the chance to prevent it, most cases are easy to fix if caught early enough. Whether you need to add coolant, flush the system, maintain it better or get out trapped air, you are equipped to handle these small tasks.Considering what can happen if rust builds up in the system, you owe it to your car to take swift action at the first sign of a problem. Make coolant changes a regular part of your car maintenance schedule. As with all things, a little prevention goes a long way to keeping repair bills and major failure at bay."
How Does a Radiator Coolant Overflow Tank Work?	"The overflow tank holds coolant. When the level in the cooling system gets too low, coolant is withdrawn from the storage to enter the cooling system. On the other hand, if there?s too much pressure, coolant will be pulled from the cooling system back into the overflow tank.Because the cooling system is a closed unit, the amount of coolant within the system should never change. However, the amount of coolant in the overflow tank will vary based on how much is needed to cool the engine at the time. As long as the system works as designed, the coolant should never rise too high in temperature. If it were to become too hot, the fluid would expand, causing major issues in the sealed system. An over-pressurized cooling system can lead to boiling liquid that can burst through any weak spot.With the added overflow tank, the pressure is better regulated. Expanded coolant can go into the overflow tank to cool down. It will remain in the tank until it?s needed by the engine once again. "
Is a Radiator Overflow Tank Necessary?	"The radiator overflow tank has a very important job, making it impossible to imagine a vehicle without it. However, older vehicles didn?t come with an overflow tank. In these older cooling systems, multiple vents were used to allow the extra pressure out. With this system, there was an escape when the coolant got hot. The downside to this type of system is the pollution it creates. Antifreeze is toxic, making it less than ideal for pumping into the environment. Even worse, coolant has a sweet taste which makes it appealing to kids and animals. Today?s cars all come with a radiator overflow tank or another form of expansion tank system. These designs ensure that the excess pressure from the hot coolant has somewhere to go besides the atmosphere. It?s the safest and most effective way found to deal with regulating engine temperatures. "
How Full Should the Coolant Overflow Tank Be?	"It?s important that you keep a close eye on how much coolant is in the reservoir tank. In general, you want the tank to be a minimum of 30% full. However, a quick look at the side of the tank should reveal how much coolant should be added. There will be a maximum and minimum fill line that can be used as a gauge. You don?t want to ever open the expansion tank?s radiator cap or even the coolant overflow cap when the engine is hot. Doing so is extremely dangerous."
what are the Main Components of the Cooling System ?	"1. RadiatorThe car radiator is responsible for acting as a heat exchanger. It is created from metal ? typically aluminum ? and it contains several pipes attached to it. The heat from the hot engine coolant is dispersed into the radiator, where it can be replaced with cooler ambient air.The radiator contains a drainage plug, which is helpful for bleeding the system. There?s also an inlet and outlet port. 2. Radiator CapThe radiator cap might be small, but it has an important job. While it does cap off the radiator, its purpose goes far beyond simply keeping contaminants out of the cooling system.In most systems, there?s a spring-loaded valve found in the radiator cap. When the temperature of the coolant rises, and the pressure expands, the valve in the cap opens so the additional coolant can flow into the overflow tank. With this valve in place, the cooling system remains pressurized without overheating. 3. CoolantThe coolant mixture is a cross between antifreeze and water. Water alone won?t do the job adequately because it can freeze. However, the mixture of the two helps keep the water from freezing and prevents the fluid from overheating. Most coolant mixtures also contain some form of rust protection. When using the appropriate formula, you ensure the metal components don?t corrode. Heat stored in the coolant can also be used through the climate control system to provide warmth to the cabin. 4. ThermostatThe thermostat is also designed as a coolant valve. It allows for coolant to pass through when it?s needed the most. Most thermostat designs contain paraffin wax, allowing for expansion when certain temperatures are reached. This expansion is what causes the thermostat to open.On the other hand, it?s going to close when the temperature is too low in the system. It?s the gateway for proper coolant flow. 5. Water PumpThe heat coming from the cooling system needs somewhere to go. With the help of the water pump, the hot coolant is circulated out of the engine into the radiator where the heat can be dispersed. Once the coolant has reduced temperature, the cooler liquid gets pushed back into the engine to repeat the process. The water pump is usually driven by a belt off of the engine. If this belt ceases, your water pump will stop working and the hot coolant won?t be able to circulate, leading to an overheating engine. 6. Head GasketYou have probably heard of the term blown head gasket, and you know how bad this situation is. The head gasket is a critical component of the cooling system because it seals it apart from the engine.Both coolant and oil need to circulate through the engine, but they should remain in different passages. They should never mix. The head gasket is what keeps the two from meeting.7. Heater CoreHeat is provided in the cabin of the vehicle through the heater core. When hot coolant comes out of the engine, the temperature can be transferred through the heater core to the climate control system.The blower motor is what?s responsible for pushing the heat into the cabin. However, this part is prone to leakage when it fails, which can cause other issues. 8. HosesAll cooling systems are made from a variety of hoses connecting everything together. There are hoses running to and from the radiator and engine, allowing for safe passage of the coolant. As you can imagine, some of the coolant is extremely hot, so the hoses must be constructed from durable materials.Over time, the hoses can wear out. It?s recommended to inspect the hoses periodically to look for wear. If you see any defects, it?s best to replace them immediately. Otherwise, you could end up with a blown hose or a major leak that could dump all of the coolant. Without coolant circulating in the system, the engine will quickly overheat and be ruined. "
Conclusion 	"So, there you have it. A clear guide on not only how your overflow tank works, but also why you have one and how it works with other engine cooling components. Your vehicle?s cooling system truly is an amazing piece of engineering that?s been carefully designed to be efficient and effective at what it does. Hopefully, this guide has answered any questions that you may have had. Please feel free to refer back to it whenever you need to."
How Much Does A Water Pump Replacement Cost?	"On average, you might spend between $300 and $750 to have the water pump replaced in your vehicle. However, the cost depends on what type of vehicle you drive and whether you are going to replace the water pump yourself. Parts might be $200 to $350, while the rest is labor. Another big factor in water pump replacement cost is the extra parts you have to replace. For example, in many European cars, the water pump is driven by the timing belt, which is usually replaced at the same time as the water pump, and this will increase the water pump replacement cost drastically. In that case you can expect you can pay up to $2,000 ? or even more ? for a water pump replacement cost.Average Replacement Cost by Car ModelThese are the average water pump replacement cost per car model and year with the most common engine types. However, you may have a different engine type in your car, which may give you a completely different price.Car Model	Part Cost	Labor Cost	Total CostFord F-150	$150	$250	$400Honda CR-V	$150	$200	$350Chevrolet Silverado	$350	$200	$550Ram 1500/2500/3500	$200	$250	$450Toyota RAV4	$400	$350	$750Toyota Camry	$150	$300	$450"
Factors Affecting Water Pump Replacement Cost ?	"To determine a cost for the water pump replacement cost, we need to look at what factors affect the price, and here are the most important factors you should look at.1. Car Make/ModelProbably the biggest factor affecting the price is the car and engine model you drive. In some cars, replacing the water pump is very easy and can be done in under 30 minutes, while in others, it can take many hours. You may have to disassemble almost the entire engine to reach and replace your water pump.Also, If you have a small engine in your vehicle, there?s probably a smaller water pump installed, so your price won?t be high for the part. On the other hand, the more work the water pump is responsible for, the higher the price is going to be. Additionally, luxury car parts can often cost far more than their budget counterparts. 2. OEM vs. AftermarketIf you want the vehicle to continue running as it did from the factory, the OEM water pump is your best option. However, the OEM equipment is usually more expensive than those that are made by aftermarket manufacturers.With that said, many aftermarket water pumps continue to provide reliable service. Do the research to make the right decision for your vehicle. 3. DIY vs. ProfessionalIf you have some mechanical skills, it might be beneficial for you to replace the water pump on your own. When this is done, you save a lot of money on the labor.However, if you aren?t equipped to change the water pump, you need to visit a repair shop. The labor charge will depend on where you are located and what kind of vehicle you drive. 4. Additional Parts Required When the water pump is changed, you can?t just buy that single part and assume you have everything you need. At the bare minimum, you will also need to purchase new coolant and a water pump gasket for a proper replacement.Aside from that, other parts could be damaged at the same time, depending on what has gone wrong with your vehicle. If you need a new serpentine belt, timing belt or pulleys, you can expect a higher repair cost due to the extra parts and labor required. As I discussed earlier, some cars also have the water pump driven by the timing belt, and both of these parts are usually replaced at the same time. This will drastically increase the replacement cost, and you could be looking at the cost of a timing belt replacement instead."
How Often Should a Water Pump be Replaced?	"A water pump should typically be replaced every 60,000 to 100,000 miles, but it depends on the engine and car model. However, some car models do not have a scheduled replacement interval for the water pump, and it only needs to be replaced when it fails.In many modern cars, the water pump is driven by the timing belt and should be replaced at the timing belt replacement interval.The most common way in older car models is to replace it only when it fails. Some failures exhibit as a minor leak. However, the water pump could cease completely because of a broken bearing or impeller. Either way, the replacement should occur immediately. By properly maintaining the cooling system, you help the water pump last as long as possible. With a serpentine belt replacement, coolant flushes and repair to any defective parts, you can help the water pump last as long as possible."
How To Tell If The Water Pump is Failing?	"1. Overheating EngineWhen the engine overheats, it?s always possible that the water pump has failed. You might first notice the overheating engine because of the warning light that comes on the dashboard. You may also have a temperature gauge that shows the engine is getting hotter than normal.Another sign of an overheating engine is steam coming from the front of the vehicle. If you see this occurring, it?s best to pull over until you figure out what?s wrong. Because the water pump is necessary for cooling down the engine, any malfunction can cause the motor to run hotter. While a water pump could be to blame, so can other defective parts. It could also have to do with contaminated coolant, a bad thermostat or a damaged radiator. Either way, the heat will eventually build up and cause permanent damage to the motor. 2. Fluctuating TemperatureWhen the cooling system is working as it should, the temperature of the engine should consistently remain normal. On the other hand, a water pump that?s going bad can cause unusual fluctuations that gain your attention. If there is a defect, the engine could start to overheat and then level off temporarily. If this is the case, you?ll see the temperature gauge moving up and down.Again, the water pump isn?t the only part that can be blamed. If the radiator is damaged, the same issues can occur. There could also be an air bubble trapped in the closed system, leading to trouble. Otherwise, a sensor in today?s modern cooling systems can be finicky when damaged. 3. Strange SoundsWhen you head down the road, you don?t want to hear any unusual sounds. Yet, when the water pump is going bad, there could be some sounds that you don?t normally hear. The engine could start squealing, buzzing or whining in these situations. These noises are also created when there?s a problem with the accessory belt, which can cause damage to the water pump. The accessory belt could exhibit trouble if the bearings are worn out or a pulley is loose.If the belt is on too tight or too loose, the same problems can occur. That?s why it?s important to check the specifications of the belt tension to ensure it?s running as it should. With regular inspections and maintenance, you can keep the water pump in optimal operating condition. No matter what are causing the engine noise, it?s important that you have it checked out right away before any permanent damage occurs. 4. Leaking FluidThe automotive cooling system is designed to be completely closed. For this reason, you should never see any coolant fluid leaking from the vehicle. If there is a puddle below the car, it?s something to be alarmed about. The color of the fluid varies based on what type of coolant is used, but it?s often green or orange-colored. Fluid can leak if a seal or gasket around the water pump wears out. There?s also the chance of the water pump cracking or breaking because of old age and abuse.You may not even see the leaking fluid if the drips are slow. A slower trickle can land on various automotive parts under the car and harden. In this case, you might only know that there?s a leak because the levels keep dropping, requiring you to add more coolant. Where the coolant leaks, there could be corrosion on the parts as it hardens. Additionally, a coolant leak doesn?t automatically mean that there?s a problem with the water pump. The problem could stem from any broken hose, defective radiator, or failing seal. Either way, it?s imperative that you have the leak diagnosed immediately. Without the right amount of coolant in the engine, the motor can fail completely, leading to a much higher repair bill. "
Can I drive with a broken water pump?	"No. You should not drive a car with a failing or bad water pump, because it?s a serious issue. If the engine hasn?t started to overheat already, it won?t be long. Once that happens, you are facing serious internal engine damage that isn?t simple to repair.The majority of vehicles have a warning light that tells you when the engine is overheating. Once this light comes on, you are out of time. In fact, the engine may have already gotten hot enough to cause damage.As with any mechanical failure of your vehicle, it?s best to have the problem looked at right away. Yet, when it comes to the cooling system, you have no time to wait. This isn?t a system you want to procrastinate with when it comes to diagnosis and repair.Once you know something is wrong with the cooling system, it?s best to pull over and figure out what?s happening. The only way you should drive home or to the shop is if you can ensure that the engine won?t overheat. Otherwise, it?s best to have it towed and repaired immediately."
Is replacing a water pump worth it?	"Yes. Replacing a water pump will ensure that the life of your engine is extended and is in most cases worth it. However, if your car is very old and not worth anything, it may be worth buying a new car instead if it is difficult to replace the water pump on that particular car model."
What makes a water pump go bad?	"Water pumps go bad due to age and heat from the engine. Many modern water pumps have a plastic impeller that begins to crack with age and deteriorate. In addition, gaskets and seals can begin to deteriorate and leak due to age."
How long does a water pump take to replace?	"A water pump can get replaced in between 1 and 4 hours in most cars. However, in some cars the water pump is driven by the timing belt, which can make the process much longer and more difficult. The time-consuming part is to bleed the cooling system afterward if you are not used to it."
A Mechanic?s Tips about water pump replacement	"Always fill your car with a new coolant after a water pump change if you haven?t changed it in a while.If your water pump is driven by the timing belt or timing chain, it may be a good time to replace them at the same time to save future costs.Be sure to bleed the coolant system after replacing the water pump, otherwise your car engine could overheat and get damaged. I recommend using a vacuum coolant. A failed coolant bleeding can result in hot spots in the car?s cooling system, which can result in serious damage to your engine if you?re unlucky.Never start changing the water pump before you are 100% sure that the car?s coolant is cold; otherwise, serious injuries may result, as the car?s coolant may reach boiling temperatures."
Conclusion	"As you can see, there are a wide variety of factors that will affect your final water pump replacement cost. By taking the time to research different options and finding a reputable mechanic, you can ensure that your new water pump will be installed correctly and last for years to come.I hope you now have the knowledge to determine the water pump replacement cost for your car model, and can now decide if you need to replace it."
Thermostat Housing Function 	"The thermostat housing holds the thermostat, and it can be a standalone or integrated design, depending on what type of vehicle you drive. Leaks are normally caused by a damaged or cracked housing, a failing seal or because of exposure to extreme temperatures. The cooling system is designed to keep the engine running at the best temperature, thereby avoiding overheating situations. Coolant and water are sent through the engine block to remove the heat. This fluid is routed by the water pump, that?s driven by the serpentine belt. To determine how much coolant should be sent, the thermostat needs to read the temperatures and determine whether to open or close the system.When the engine is cool or operating below the normal operating temperature, the thermostat stays closed. With a closed thermostat, the coolant is circulating in the engine but not back to the radiator. However, once the engine becomes too hot, the thermostat opens, so the coolant can get back to the radiator, where the temperature is reduced. The thermostat housing is holding the thermostat in place. It doesn?t have a purpose other than to hold the thermostat where it needs to be for proper operation."
Thermostat Housing Location	"The thermostat tends to be placed where the car?s upper radiator hose is connected to its intake manifold cooling passage. You will find it near the water pump in most cases, but it could also be found on the lower hose in some car models. There are some vehicles that have two thermostats, especially diesel trucks. Either way, the thermostat housing is going to encompass this part. It?s the area where the thermostat sits. "
Thermostat Housing Leak Causes	"1. Damaged/Cracked HousingMost often, the thermostat housing leaks because it becomes damaged or cracked. The majority of housings are made from either plastic or metal, but they are not indestructible.The housing can also become damaged because the mechanic installing or replacing it applies too much torque to the bolts. Once the housing becomes damaged, coolant will leak and create a problem.2. Failing SealsThe housing also contains seals or gaskets to ensure a secure fit. As with any gaskets or seals, the material wears down over time.At first, you may just notice a small amount of seepage. As the damage gets worse, the coolant will leak out more.3. Exposure to Extreme TemperaturesConsidering that the thermostat housing is responsible for circulating coolant, you would think it could handle high temperatures. That?s true to a point.However, if the engine overheats, the housing will be subject to heat it?s not meant to deal with. This excessive heat can cause damage to the housing, which leads to a leak. "
Thermostat Housing Replacement Cost	"On average, you might spend $75 to $400 to replace the thermostat housing. The part itself may only cost $25 to $250. If you can?t replace it yourself, the labor might add another $50 to $150. In most cases, the job is simple enough to perform if you have basic mechanical knowledge and the right tools. However, you shouldn?t try to tackle the job if you are unfamiliar with the system and coolant bleeding.If your car usually has a plastic thermostat, you may be able to purchase an aluminum replacement instead. These aftermarket parts don?t add much more to the price but should last longer. For the additional cost, you could save yourself from having to perform another replacement down the road. "
How to Replace the Thermostat Housing	"1. Prepare AreaBefore you start any repair, you want to get your area ready. Park on a flat surface and make sure the parking brake is on to secure the vehicle.You also want to gather all the tools and supplies (Coolant) that you need ahead of time. This simple step reduces the time you spend hunting down equipment when you need it. 2. Cool EngineBefore you move on, it?s essential to leave the engine sit. The motor should be completely cooled off before moving forward.If you were out driving, then the car may need to sit for an hour. Pop the hood and come back when it?s time to proceed. If you haven?t been driving, you should be able to get started right away. 3. Empty the coolantIn some vehicles, there is a drain plug for the coolant on the bottom of the radiator. Draining the coolant through the drain plug before will make the whole procedure more pleasant. Use a bucket to collect the coolant.However, there are plenty of models that don?t require this step and don?t have a drain plug. That?s why it?s important to read through the service manual before proceeding.4. Remove Thermostat Housing BoltsOn most housings, there are two bolts that hold everything in its position. You will want to remove these bolts with the help of a socket wrench.You can also use an adjustable crescent wrench. This tool helps you to put pressure where it?s needed without taking your hands off. 5. Take off Thermostat HousingOnce the bolts have been removed, you should be able to take off the housing without much effort. Pull the housing straight up to take it off.Remember that if you didn?t drain the coolant before through the drain plug, it will pour out a lot of coolant by removing the thermostat housing. Place a large bucket under so you will not spill coolant on the floor. Coolant is poisonous.While the housing is off, inspect the gasket. If there?s any sign of wear or damage, you will need to replace the gasket too. Some people prefer to do this even if the gasket looks like it?s in great shape. 6. Clean Surface AreaBefore you attach the housing, you want to clean the area where it will attach. There shouldn?t be any residual debris or contaminants between the two. If there is, leakage could continue, even after the repair. You could use an engine degreaser to get all of the old gasket off. Make sure all of the cleaner residue is also removed before you attach the new housing. 7. Install New HousingPut the new housing in its position and tighten the bolts carefully. You don?t want to overtighten these bolts or you could cause the new housing to break. Additionally, you may need to put coolant in the reservoir to get the levels back up to normal. Then you need to bleed the coolant system, which can be quite difficult. Use a repair manual or our guide: How to Bleed Your Cars Cooling System (9 Easy Steps)Your next step is to take the vehicle for a test drive. Pay close attention to the temperature gauge. Once you get the vehicle back, you should also look at the housing to see if there are any apparent leaks. If it is still leaking, the problem could be a gasket that wasn?t put in properly during the installation."
Can I drive with a cracked thermostat housing?	"No, it is not recommended to drive with a cracked thermostat housing. A cracked thermostat housing will in most cases leak and this can cause your engine to lose coolant and overheat. An overheated engine can cause serious damage to the engine."
How long should a thermostat housing last?	"Thermostat housings are built to last the life of the car. However, many thermostat housings are made of plastic or metals that will wear out over time. However, you can expect a thermostat housing to last at least 10 years in most car models."
Why would a thermostat housing crack?	"A thermostat housing is in most car models made of plastic or metal. If it is made of plastic, it will wear down over time due to the heat. If it is made of metal, it may begin to corrode over time and crack."
Can you replace a car thermostat yourself?	"Replacing the thermostat is a fairly simple job in most car models. However, properly bleeding the cooling system to prevent damage afterward is the difficult part. However, with the right tools and a good repair manual, it is possible for almost anyone."
what are the Car Cooling System Basics ?	"Before you can understand where the bubbles come from, you need to comprehend how the system works. Your car?s cooling system is made up of numerous components. There?s the water pump that is responsible for pushing the coolant to the motor, and there are other parts, as well.The system also contains a thermostat, which is responsible for controlling coolant temperature. The thermostat must ensure that the fluid doesn?t freeze or boil. You probably also know about the radiator, which helps to reduce the temperature of the coolant after it leaves the engine. With the help of outside air running through, the coolant can be cooled down before it heads back through the motor. On top of the radiator is a cap that?s needed to maintain the appropriate amount of pressure in the system. If pressure is lost, the coolant?s boiling and freezing points can be dramatically affected. These major parts create a continuous loop known as the cooling system. Coolant is routed through a series of hoses to the engine, where it removes some of the heat. The coolant is then taken to the radiator to cool down, and the cycle continues as long as the car is running."
Reasons Bubbles are in Coolant Reservoir ?	"If you notice air bubbles in the coolant reservoir, this is in most cases completely normal. But if there are a lot of bubbles and you notice problems like overheating, it could indicate a broken pressure cap, a blown head gasket, a coolant leak, or trapped air pockets.Here is a more detailed list of why you may see bubbles in the coolant reservoir:1. No issue at allA lot of times people get more worried than they should when they see some bubbles in the coolant reservoir because they have heard horror stories about a blown head gasket causing it.But if you only see a few bubbles when topping up the coolant system and if you don?t notice any other cooling issues like overheating, you probably have nothing to worry about.However, if you notice a lot of bubbles along with an overflowing or an overheated coolant system, you likely have an issue with the system.2. Broken Pressure CapTo keep the system pressurized, there?s a special cap perfectly fitted to the radiator. The cap is needed to ensure a perfect amount of pressure remains in the system. If this cap is damaged or has broken, air can leak into the system where it doesn?t belong.You might see some bubbles that form near the pressure cap. Overheating can also occur if the coolant?s temperature can?t be lowered completely. Thankfully, this is one of the easiest problems to remedy ? a simple cap replacement is all that?s needed. 3. Blown Head GasketOn the other end of the spectrum is a blown head gasket, which no one wants to deal with. When a head gasket blows, the air pressure from the system can be pushed out, lowering the boiling point of the coolant. The coolant will overheat, causing the engine to get too hot as well. If left unchecked, the engine can suffer permanent damage.Sometimes, the head gasket blows because the engine overheated in the first place, which is why you should always stop driving immediately when the motor temperature gets too hot. If the head gasket is blown, you can see air bubbles or oil in the coolant. It?s also possible to see coolant in the oil, depending on where the gasket failed. 4. Air PocketsAir pockets can occur in the system immediately following a coolant flush. As coolant is added, air can get trapped, leading to a circulation backup in the motor. If there?s air trapped, you will see bubbles in the radiator. The engine could also start to overheat. It?s possible to bleed the air out of the cooling system, but it should only be done by a professional. 5. Coolant LeakCoolant leaks can cause not only coolant to leak out of the system, but also air to leak into the system. Broken gaskets or hoses are the most common places for coolant leaks.The cooling system is made up of many different hoses, all of which need to remain sealed. If a hose becomes old, it can get easily damaged and break. Any small crack or hole in a hose can be a disaster that should be dealt with immediately. Not only will coolant leak out through this hose and cause the level to be too low, but the engine can also overheat. Replacing the hose is your only way of resolving this problem. 6. Broken ThermostatThe thermostat is responsible for controlling the amount of coolant that moves in and out of the engine. It must open and close at particular times based on how hot the coolant is. If the system has started to overheat because of a broken thermostat, it will be possible to see bubbles in the coolant. Replacing the thermostat isn?t usually expensive, costing an average of $150 to $400 for parts and labor. 7. Malfunctioning Water PumpThe water pump is needed to circulate the coolant through the hoses and pipes. It needs to be functional, so the coolant reaches every corner of the system. If the water pump becomes damaged, coolant won?t be able to circulate, and the engine could overheat. Of course, this situation in itself can lead to bubbling coolant.Additionally, air can get trapped in the water pump if it is defective. If you don?t replace the pump, air will remain inside the system. 8. Defective Heater Control ValveThe car?s heater control valve is responsible for allowing hot coolant into the passenger compartment so it can warm the cabin. Hot coolant flows from the engine and can be used by the climate control system to warm you up on a cold day. It?s an efficient way to re-route heat to where it is more useful. If the heater valve is faulty, air can seep into the system, resulting in air bubbles arising. It can also cause the engine to overheat. What?s worse with this problem is the cabin won?t get the heat it needs, leaving passengers cold in the dead of winter. 9. Rust/ContaminationThe car radiator is made from metal. Over time,it?s bound to rust no matter how well you take care of your car. However, it?s going to rust even faster if you don?t take care of it. That?s why it?s important to clean the radiator often. Debris can clog the radiator, leading to damage that could have been prevented. You also need to makesure that the system has the right amount of coolant inside. When the radiator degrades or is clogged, the coolant has trouble dispersing heat properly. Inside the system, the coolant will boil, leading to bubbles in the tank. With this boiling coolant also comes the risk of an overheated engine, which can lead to permanent engine damage."
Why is my coolant bubbling but not overheating?	"If there is air trapped in the coolant system, it can cause the coolant to bubble but not overheat. It could also be due to a bad coolant pressure cap, or a small leak in the head gasket which is not large enough to cause the engine to overheat."
How do I know if your head gasket is blown?	"To get a reliable answer as to whether your head gasket is blown, you need to have a professional mechanic take a look. However, signs such as white smoke from the exhaust, overheating, oil in coolant and coolant in oil are some common ways to tell that your head gasket may be bad."
How do I know if I have air trapped in my cooling system?	"The only way to know if you have air trapped in the cooling system is to flush the system or properly bleed the coolant system. If you see bubbles rising in the reservoir or if the engine temperature fluctuates, it is a sign that there may be air trapped in the cooling system."
Can air bubbles in coolant cause overheating?	"Yes. If the air bubbles are from air pockets or a bad head gasket, it can cause your engine to overheat. An overheated engine can result in very expensive repair costs, so you should definitely get it fixed as soon as possible."
How Much Coolant Does a Car Hold?	"Wondering how much coolant your car needs? Check out our guide to learn everything you need to know about car coolants and antifreeze! How Much Coolant Does A Car HoldCoolant is an essential fluid for regular car operation. When the time comes to top off the system or perform a flush, you want to know ? how much coolant does a car hold?The amount of coolant used in a car depends solely on what type of vehicle it is. Most vehicles hold between one and three gallons of coolant, but it can be more, especially with a full-size truck or SUV. Check the owner?s manual to determine the appropriate amount for your vehicle.In this guide, we define what engine coolant is and show you its purpose. We also discuss how to top off the system, evaluate the three main types of coolant and show you how this fluid differs from antifreeze."
what are Engine Coolant?	"Your car?s engine coolant is the fluid that moves through the cooling system to remove heat and ensure the motor works at normal temperatures. Considering your car engine can see temperatures of more than 200 degrees Fahrenheit, this is no easy job.The fluid gets pumped into the engine from the radiator. Here, it takes on the heat coming from the motor and cools back down as it moves through the system. Once the fluid is cooled back down, it can circulate through the engine once again to dissipate more heat. "
what are the Function of Coolant ?	"There are many purposes for having high-quality coolant in your cooling system. Here are the three main purposes of this fluid.Removes heat from the motor and raises the boiling point of the fluid higher than what?s normal.Reduces the freezing of the liquid when temperatures go below 32 degrees Fahrenheit by lowing the freezing point so the engine block doesn?t crack and break. Prevents corrosion to the heater core, radiator and engine. Coolant might not be discussed as much as engine oil, but it?s just as important as an automotive fluid. Without the right amount of fluid in the system, engine failure can occur. "
How to Top Off Engine Coolant ?	"1. Park CarBefore you can work with the coolant in your engine, the car must be cooled off. Hot coolant is dangerous and can lead to serious injury.Park your vehicle on a flat surface. If you were driving, the car should sit for at least an hour or two until the motor has cooled down. 2. Locate ReservoirYou need to find the appropriate location to fill the coolant levels. You can look in the owner?s manual for more directions for your particular car model.You are looking for a clear, plastic container that has a bright-colored liquid inside. Within this reservoir, you will see a MIN and MAX line, showing how full it is. If the coolant is below the MIN line, you need to add more fluid. 3. Mix CoolantYou might need to mix the coolant before using it. You can also purchase pre-mixed coolant to make it easier, but these formulas are often more expensive in the long run.To mix up the coolant, follow all of the instructions on the packaging. Also, it?s very important that you use the right coolant type for your vehicle. If you are topping off the coolant, fill the system with the same fluid that is already inside. Otherwise, a bad chemical reaction can occur from mixing two various formulations.If you aren?t sure what the differences are between coolant types, we will discuss that more in a minute. We also help you understand the difference between antifreeze and coolant if you need more direction. 4. Fill to MAX LineCarefully pour your mixed coolant into the reservoir. Pay close attention to where the MAX line is.Once the coolant reaches the MAX line, you want to stop filling. You can wipe up any spills and close the reservoir. You should be good to go. "
what are the  Coolant Types?	"1. IATThis is one of the older formulations of coolant. You won?t find this type used in modern cars today because there are options that are more effective. IAT stands for inorganic additive technology and is slowly being phased out.If you drive an older vehicle that uses IAT coolant, you need to flush the system more often than most. On average, it should be replaced every two years or 24,000 miles, whichever comes first. Otherwise, your cooling system is at risk of failure. 2. OATFrom 2000 and newer vehicles, the OAT coolant is much more common. OAT stands for organic acid technology and it is mainly used by GM vehicles. With this coolant, you can go much longer between changes. On average, it shouldn?t need to be changed until your car hits 150,000 miles or five years lapse, whichever comes first. With such a wider interval, you save a lot of money and avoid regular maintenance. Most OAT coolants are colored either red or orange. With the fully neutralized acids, the fluid is completely anti-corrosive for maximum protection. 3. HOATThere?s also the option to use HOAT coolant. HOAT stands for Hybrid Organic Acid Technology.It?s most comparable to the OAT coolant that we previously discussed, so it has a replacement cycle that is similar. However, HOAT coolant can come in a variety of colors, including yellow or turquoise, depending on the formulation. "
deffereces between Coolant and Antifreeze ?	"If you are around the automotive world for any amount of time, you?ll hear the words antifreeze and coolant used interchangeably, even though they are quite different. These are not the same formulations and shouldn?t be used in place of one another. Engine coolant is the fluid that circulates through the engine to keep it at appropriate temperatures. Coolant is a solution that?s designed by mixing several other substances together. The pre-mixed coolant contains antifreeze. You can also purchase antifreeze as a concentrated formula and mix it with water to make your own coolant. However, this shouldn?t be done by anyone that isn?t experienced. Antifreeze is a chemical-based liquid. It?s made from ethylene glycol, which is also found in the pre-mixed coolant formulations that you put in your vehicle. If you choose to purchase it straight, you must mix it with the appropriate water type and amount. Only after the composition is correct should you funnel it into the cooling system of your vehicle. Basically, you have two options. You can purchase the pre-mixed solution, which is known as coolant. This formula is going to cost you more because it has water mixed into it, but it?s the easiest option to use if you aren?t experienced. Otherwise, you would choose a bottle of antifreeze and mix it equally with water to create your own coolant. Of course, you should always read the labels on the product and follow all of the directions as they can vary based on the brand you purchase. Either way, the antifreeze and coolant formulations are both toxic. You should keep all bottles away from pets and kids. The liquid can have a sweet flavor, making it desirable to the vulnerable. Additionally, it?s important to dispose of old coolant and antifreeze properly."
How much coolant does a car need in Litres?	"Most cars need between 3 and 7 liters of coolant, but it depends on the make and model of the car, as well as the cooling system type. However, check your car?s owner?s manual or consult with a mechanic to be sure."
Is it OK to add new coolant without draining the old?	"Yes, you can add fresh coolant to your car?s radiator without necessarily draining the old stuff first. However, it?s generally a good idea to flush and replace your coolant every few years to prevent rust, corrosion, and other buildup that can clog up your cooling system and diminish its overall performance."
Can I overfill coolant?	"Yes, you can overfill coolant. It happens more often than you might think, especially with newer cars that have smaller reservoirs. If you overfill the coolant reservoir, it will push coolant out of the reservoir and you may see white smoke coming from the reservoir while driving."
How much coolant does it take to fill a radiator?	"This will vary depending on the size of your radiator, but typically you?ll need between 1 and 2 gallons of coolant after a radiator replacement. To just fill the radiator, it requires less. Always check your owner?s manual for specific instructions on how to add coolant to your particular vehicle."
what are VW G12 Coolant?	"G12 is a pink or red coolant based on ethylene glycol and carboxylate. It doesn?t contain silicates, and has a service life lasting from four to five years. G12 coolant is used in model years 1996 to 2001. The freezing point of this coolant is -50ø C or -58ø F with a boiling point of 118ø C or 245ø F. The ethylene glycol percentage of G12 coolant is between fifty and sixty percent, allowing it to perform as well as possible. It also contains about five percent distilled water. There are other additives included, such as dye for better visibility. The downside to G12 coolant is that it doesn?t prevent corrosion. It only starts to fight against corrosion once the process has started. However, it is effective at getting rid of corrosion as it starts to form. "
what are Engine Coolant?	"Every type of engine coolant is made from a mixture of ethylene glycol or propylene glycol with a unique blend of additives. Engine coolant flows through the cooling system and engine to remove heat from the hot motor. It also ensures that the coolant doesn?t freeze during the winter.Just like motor oil, engine coolant also provides some lubrication to the internal components. When the consistency isn?t right or there?s not enough fluid, friction can occur. In general, there are three types of antifreeze formulations: G11, G12 and G13. Each of these has its own properties and is used for a variety of applications. "
differencesbetween G11 vs. G12 and G13 Antifreeze ?	"1. G11G11 coolant is produced from a classic silicate basis with inorganic additives. This is the coolant used on vehicles made before 1996. However, there are some cars with model years up to 2016 that can tolerate the use of G11.G11 coolant is known for creating protection on the surfaces and slowing down corrosion. This antifreeze is green or blue in color. However, the shelf life of G11 is only up to three years, and the protective properties begin to degrade as it is used. Plus, this coolant doesn?t tolerate higher temperatures above 105 degrees Fahrenheit, making heat transfer lower. G11 isn?t good in a car with an aluminum radiator or block because of the lack of protection. You also want to avoid using low-end brands, such as Polarnik or Euroline. These brands have shown to mislabel the amount of protection offered. 2. G12There are various types of G12 coolant, but the majority are colored pink or red. These formulations don?t contain silicates, making them based on ethylene glycol and carboxylate compounds. However, the newer formulation means that the anti-corrosion properties are only selective, working where there is already corrosion occurring. G12 is usually sold as a concentrate, so you will need to mix and dilute it with the appropriate amount of distilled water. You can find this ratio on the label. There?s also G12 + antifreeze, but nothing much is different. The color of this coolant is red, but it is supposed to be better for the environment. G12 ++ also exists and its purpose is to be longer lasting. This formulation offers an improved mixture of carboxylated compounds. 3. G13This newer form of antifreeze is purple. With a hybrid antifreeze, there?s a similar composition but a different ratio of the organic and silicate compounds. This coolant provides more protection. You will use G13 on the newer model cars. It?s recommended to change this antifreeze every five years. "
Can Antifreeze Be Mixed?	"Whether you are told to use VW G12 coolant or another type, the top question always heard is, can I mix two types of antifreeze together? In some cases, this might be possible, but several factors must be considered. To determine what can and cannot be mixed, you must understand the composition and purpose of each antifreeze type.The most obvious difference between coolants is the color, but that?s just about appearance. What?s most important is how the composition differs. G11 uses ethylene glycol and an inorganic base. It can be mixed with anything that?s compatible with this base.G13 contains a propylene glycol base. It?s meant to be more environmentally safe, so it doesn?t mix as well with some others. If you can avoid mixing antifreeze, that would be best. It?s always wiser to stick with what should be used in your vehicle. However, here are a few guidelines if you find yourself in need of mixing a small amount of coolant.G11 will not mix with G12. G11 could be mixed with G12+ or G13 in some situations.G12  doesn?t mix with G12 +. Unless you are 100% positive that mixing the coolant is okay for your vehicle, you should avoid the practice. By veering away from what the manufacturer recommends, you could cause damage to the cooling system and radiator. The worst case scenario is that you damage the engine or water pump. These are both repair bills you don?t want to deal with, especially when we are discussing the price of a bottle of coolant. "
How to Choose the Best Coolant ?	"Whether you are using VW G12 coolant or something else, it?s always best to stick with the manufacturer?s recommendations. You can find these in the owner?s manual or speak with your local dealership service department. There?s also a chance that the coolant type is listed on the reservoir tank, where you will fill up the antifreeze.On top of purchasing the right type, you can choose from fully concentrated coolant or pre-mixed. Unless you are in an extreme hurry, you get the best deal from buying the concentrated coolant. You get more product for the money and you only need to mix it with the appropriate amount of distilled water. Plus, mixing the coolant yourself allows you to make the solution best for your car and region. If you are in a cold climate, you might need a more concentrated formula, while those in hot climates will need less. As you choose between brands, choose something that gets good reviews. You might pay a little more to get a better brand, but the protection of your car?s engine and cooling system is worth the additional cost. Additionally, when you choose coolant, make sure you take a look at the shelf life. If you plan to store the coolant, it?s necessary to store it properly to keep it in good condition. Rotate coolant in your shed when you use it, so the older product is being used before that which is newer. If you are ever in doubt about what coolant you should be using, seek the help of a professional."
what are Coolant or Antifreeze?	"Coolant and antifreeze are essential fluids that keep your engine working at an efficient temperature. With coolant, the engine continues to run at normal temperatures, even when it is scorching hot or freezing cold outside. Antifreeze contains a concentrated formula made from silica and ethylene glycol. It is meant to be mixed with water to create coolant. "
what are the Causes of Coolant/Antifreeze Leaks ?	"The most common cause of a coolant leak is a leaking radiator hose or a leaking radiator. It can also leak from a failed water pump or a defective expansion tank. It?s very common to find leaks around hose clamps and from cracks in plastic tubes in the cooling system.Here?s a more detailed list of the possible causes of coolant leaks:1. Hole in RadiatorCoolant Leak RadiatorThe radiator is subject to a lot of abuse, sitting at the front of the vehicle the way it does. Corrosion is one of the main reasons that a radiator fails. It can leave a hole behind that allows coolant to escapeAdditionally, the sealing gasket located between the radiator and tank can wear out, causing a leak. There could also be a leak coming from one of the hoses connected to the radiator. Over time, these hoses become brittle and simply fail. 2. Leaky Radiator CapRadiator Cap OpenOne might not consider the impact this small cap has on the cooling system. The radiator contains a lot of pressure, with this cap responsible for holding it all in.When it?s working correctly, the cap creates a solid, reliable seal that ensures the system runs with optimal pressure. Over time, the seal to this cap starts to deteriorate, allowing coolant to seep out. 3. Blown Head GasketBad Head GasketThe car?s head gasket is responsible for keeping the engine oil and coolant separate. When the gasket first fails, you may not even know what?s happening because the leakage can be internal.However, you might start to notice coolant in the engine oil or vice versa. You will also see the engine temperatures start to rise. Eventually, the coolant will begin leaking outside of the engine, indicating a serious issue.4. Failed Water PumpThe water pump is responsible for circulating the coolant through the system. Usually, the water pump is driven by a belt. This belt connects to the engine crankshaft, but this part is subject to corrosion and leaks. The water pump itself can also suffer from external damage that leads to a leak. Either way, if the pump isn?t working right, the coolant can?t move properly, which will cause the engine to overheat. 5. Defective Expansion TankNext to the car engine, you will see a plastic container that holds coolant. It gets connected to the radiator with a hose. Its primary job is to feed coolant to the radiator as needed. However, time causes the plastic to become weak. It can easily crack and start leaking. The hose running to it can also deteriorate and leak. "
How to fix a Coolant Leak?	"Because many different issues can cause an antifreeze leak, there are also many things you can do to repair the leak. I always recommend replacing the leaking part, but here are some other methods you can use:1. Use EggsWhat do you do if you are in the middle of nowhere and your radiator is leaking? If you have some eggs in the trunk, you might be able to buy yourself some time. However, this fix isn?t recommended unless you have no other options.Allow the car to cool down and unscrew the radiator cap. Crack a couple of eggs and put them in the radiator reservoir. If the leak doesn?t stop, you can try a few more eggs. As the eggs cook, the fluid pressure will try to push them out through the holes. If all goes well, the egg will get clogged in the holes and stop the leak temporarily. However, the eggs can also lead to further damage, which is why some mechanics won?t recommend it.There are also special additives for fixing coolant leaks instead of eggs. There are reports of cooling systems getting clogged by using them, so be very careful. However, if you have an ancient car that is not worth repairing, it can be worth trying.2. Replace ClampsReplace Radiator ClampsAll of the hoses are held on with clamps. If one fails because of rust or corrosion, you will need to replace it. Allow the car to cool down. Locate the defective clamp. If it is in some positions, you might need to drain the coolant into a bucket. Take off the affected hose and remove the old clamp. Put the new clamp on and tighten it down.Fill up the radiator with fresh coolant and tighten down the cap. Run the car until it reaches normal operating temperature. Inspect the repair to ensure no more coolant is leaking. 3. Replace HosesIf there is an issue with the hose itself, you will follow many of the same procedures as when you replaced a clamp. In fact, you might consider swapping out the clamp while you have the hose off. Allow the car to cool down and locate the bad hose. You may need to drain the coolant into a bucket, depending on where the hose is. Take off the clamps holding the hose in place. Replace the hose with a new part and clamp it back down. Fill the system with fresh fluid and run the car to check for leaks. 4. Swap out RadiatorEvery radiator is installed differently, depending on the style the manufacturer uses. However, you will have some similar steps with every radiator replacement.Allow the car to cool and disconnect the automotive battery. Drain all of the coolants from the system by pulling the plug out of the bottom of the radiator. Make sure you dispose of this coolant properly.Remove any hoses that connect the radiator to the engine and take off the thermostat. If there is a fan mounted to the radiator, you need to remove that too. Take off any bolts holding the radiator to its mounting bracket.Take out the old radiator and replace it with a new one. Put the system back together in reverse, replacing any other worn-out parts in the process. Fill up the radiator and start the engine to check for leaks. "
Coolant Leak Repair Cost ?	"The cost to repair a coolant leak is between $10 and $3000. A new clamp or hose might not cost you much, but an entire radiator replacement might cost between $300 and $1,200 for parts and labor, while head gasket repair can easily cost $2,000 or more.The easiest way to save money is to get your coolant leak repaired at the first sign of trouble before it turns into something more significant."
How to Flush a Car Radiator ?	"Total Time: 1 hour and 30 minutesAllow Engine to CoolBefore you work with coolant, the engine must be completely cool. Otherwise, you could put yourself in a lot of danger because hot coolants can reach boiling temperatures and cause serious injuries. While you wait, gather all of your supplies to make the job easier. Once the engine is cooled, you are ready to pop the hood and get started. You should also put on protective clothing, gloves, and eyewear to ensure maximum protection. Drain CoolantRelease the coolant system pressure carefully by removing the radiator cap. Look for the radiator drain petcock. It?s found towards the corner of the radiator. You want to put a pan underneath it to catch the contaminated coolant.Some car models do not have this drain, and in these cases, you need to remove the lower coolant hose. Ensure there are no pets close when you are doing this because anti-freeze is extremely poisonous to them and if they drink it, they can get seriously injured or even die.Remove the petcock or hose and allow the coolant to drain. Once it has finished, you can close the petcock and continue with the next steps. Make sure you transfer the old coolant into a reliable canister to take for recycling. Reinstall the hose or drain petcock.Flush RadiatorPour distilled water into the opening of the radiator cap until the radiator is full. Put the cap back on and run the vehicle for ten minutes, allowing the distilled water to get into every crevice and flush out debris. Shut off your vehicle and wait for it to cool again. Follow the previous step where you open the petcock and allow the water to drain into the pan. Professional mechanics use special coolant flush machines for this task, which will make it much faster and easier. However, most people don?t have these expensive tools at home.Add New CoolantLook in the owner?s manual to see how much antifreeze or coolant your car needs and have that amount ready. You also want to use the type of coolant that the manufacturer recommends. Put a funnel in the radiator cap inlet and pour in your appropriate antifreeze mixture. There are also premixed solutions available to buy, but you can expect to pay more for the convenience. Also, fill up the coolant level until it reaches the maximum line on the overflow plastic tank. You don?t want to overfill the system, or it could lead to an excessive amount of pressure. If your car uses an expansion tank, it should be filled to the max sign.Test Drive/Top Off CoolantStart the engine and remove any bleeding screws in the coolant system if your car engine has one and close it when coolant starts to pour out of it. Shut off the car after a while and let it cool down, check the coolant level again, and refill if necessary. It?s important to get all the air out of the cooling system, otherwise, it can create airlocks which may cause damage to your engine if it overheats.Then you can take it for a drive around the block to get everything circulating. When you get the vehicle back, check the system for leaks. Additionally, when the engine is cooled off again, you should double-check the levels. If the levels have gone down a little, top it off. Once you are finished, you shouldn?t have to put more coolant in until the next service interval. Estimated Cost: 30 USDSupply:Distilled waterCoolant / Antifreeze"
What?s the Purpose of a Radiator Flush?	"The radiator is needed to help dissipate the heat coming from the engine. It?s an important part of the coolant system. However, as time goes on, the coolant inside the radiator can become contaminated and old. If you allow the old coolant to continue circulating, heat can?t be dissipated, leaving the engine more vulnerable to overheating. It can also cause corrosion and rust inside your engine.You could drain the coolant and refill it, but this doesn?t get all of the old liquid out. It also won?t remove all of the contaminants. Because of this problem, the new coolant will mix with contaminants, degrading the fresh fluid you just put in. It?s best to flush out the entire system, ensuring all of the old coolant is pushed out. Once that happens, you can add fresh coolant and know it will perform to optimal levels.The other benefit of performing a coolant flush is to get a closer look at the system. When you drain all of the old fluid and start flushing it, you can inspect the cooling system. This simple step gives you the opportunity to spot small leaks or problems before they turn into something larger. With a quick repair, you can head off any major engine issues down the road. "
Signs a Radiator Flush is Needed ?	"In general, a radiator flush should be done every five years or 100,000 miles (or what the maintenance schedule of your car model says), whichever comes first. However, there are different types of coolant, leading to varying intervals. Aside from the regular service, there are warning signs indicating that you might need a radiator flush at a different time.If the engine has started overheating, it?s one of the possible symptoms that the engine coolant is contaminated or the radiator clogs. First, check the coolant level to make sure it?s full. If there are no other reasons for the overheating condition, a coolant flush could resolve the issue. However, there are of course many other components, like the water pump or a blown head gasket that can cause your engine to overheat.If you see debris floating in the coolant, this is another indicator that a flush might help. You also want to look for any steam or take notice of unusual smells coming from the engine bay. However, if you are hearing strange engine noises, such as knocking or grinding or there is coolant leaking from the system, you have bigger problems to deal with and a closer inspection is required. "
Coolant Flush Cost ?	"If you have the radiator or coolant flush professionally, you might spend $50 to $300. The cost depends on the vehicle you drive, the amount of coolant needed and the type of shop you visit. If you are getting a radiator flush at the local lube, you will spend far less than if you visit a dealership.Additionally, the labor costs vary by the part of the country you are in and whether you live in an urban or rural environment. If you shop around for the best price, you can save a lot of money. However, you don?t want to go with the cheapest shop based on price alone. It?s also wise to read the customer reviews to ensure your vehicle will be taken care of. You can also ask the establishment if it offers any coupons. Occasionally, you can save a few bucks off the radiator flush because of a monthly special. There are also some locations that provide pre-paid maintenance services that help you keep the costs down. If you plan to visit the same location for all of your services, this might be a good option. If you are mechanically inclined, you can perform your own radiator flush, allowing you to save a lot of money. There are DIY kits sold for $15-$65. However, you might need to purchase some additional supplies to go with it, including the coolant. Expect to spend $2-$20 on a garden hose adaptor and $4-$20 on a radiator cleaner if you don?t want to use distilled water. You will also spend $10-$35 for a gallon of regular coolant or $15-$65 for something better."
Can I top up coolant without flushing?	"You can absolutely top up the coolant if you want, however, the mineral deposits and rust do not flush out and they remain in your cooling system. Therefore, it is better to do a real coolant flush for a much better result. If you need to top up coolant, there is most likely a coolant leak somewhere that needs to be repaired."
Can I flush coolant with tap water?	"You can flush coolant with tap water, but it?s not recommended. The minerals in hard water can enter and cause build-up in the cooling system. It?s best to use distilled water to flush the system and then replace the coolant."
what are the best thing to use to flush a radiator?	"There are a few different approaches that can be taken when flushing a radiator, and the best option may depend on the severity of the clog. The best thing overall to use is a special coolant flush cleaner. However, if your car only requires a light flush, distilled water works well and you can also do a 50/50 mix with white vinegar and destilled water."
what are HOAT Coolant?	"HOAT means Hybrid Organic Acid Technology, or Hybrid OAT. This coolant type is a combination of OAT (Organic Acid Technology) and IAT (Inorganic Acid Technology). While it is normally yellow in color, you can also find it in purple, blue, pink or turquoise. HOAT Coolant contains added silicates for additional protection against rusting or corrosion of the aluminum parts. It?s meant for newer cars, with some of the top manufacturers recommending it. This type of coolant should be flushed every 100,000 miles or every five years, whichever one comes first. This is a much longer service life than some other types of coolant. HOAT antifreeze will often be labeled with terms like G-05, G-11, G-12 and Global, and you need to check your owner?s manual to see which type your car requires. You will find HOAT coolant in many vehicles like Volkswagen, Ford, Volvo, Mercedes Benz, Audi, KIA, Hyundai, Nissan, Honda, Toyota, and many more."
What Does Coolant Do?	"Coolant contains several alcohols that are either mono ethylene glycol or mono propylene glycol. The mono propylene glycol solution is a synthetic option that has no color, is odorless, and doesn?t taste like anything. It?s the main ingredient in many popular coolants and is also used with other industrial products. It has been deemed the safer of the two and is considered non-toxic. This alcohol type features a 370-degree Fahrenheit boiling point and has a freezing point of about -74 degrees.The mono ethylene glycol is another alcohol that is used in coolants. It is colorless but has a sweet smell and taste. Plus, it?s extremely toxic. The freezing point of this alcohol is 8 degrees Fahrenheit, while the boiling point is around 400 degrees. Mixing these alcohol solutions with water to the appropriate balance helps to raise the freezing and boiling points of the engine. Not only will the right antifreeze keep the cooling system fluids from freezing in cold temperatures, but it also absorbs the heat from the motor to prevent overheating. As with other liquids, it keeps corrosion to a minimum too. "
what are The function of HOAT Coolant ?	"The main purpose of HOAT coolant is to cool off the car motor, which is the same as any coolant type. This solution flows through the channels of the engine to dissipate the heat that?s produced by the motor. It?s needed to perform well in a variety of engine temperatures.Because of the special hybrid engineering, HOAT coolant also helps to keep rust from occurring, and it?s also protective against corrosion. This characteristic works well whether it is operating in low or high temperatures. Plus, it has a significantly longer service life than most other coolant types. It can be used for up to five years or 100,000 miles without degrading.While this is much longer than IAT coolant, it?s not as effective as OAT. Still, it offers better protection against corrosion, making it the overall better option.Sometimes, manufacturers recommend mixing special additives in the system when HOAT is being used. These additives will typically include silicates, phosphates, nitrates, or molybdates.You might need to add something every 25,000 miles to ensure maximum effectiveness. However, don?t ever mix HOAT coolant with IAT or OAT solutions. Even though it is a combination of the two, you are not supposed to add any more. Otherwise, you might lose some of the valuable benefits of HOAT. "
Differences Between OAT and HOAT Coolant ?	"1. ColorThe most obvious difference between the two is the color. HOAT is normally yellow in color, but you can also find it in purple, blue, pink or turquoise.In almost all cases, the OAT coolant is orange. In comparison, IAT coolant is often going to be green.2. LifetimeIt?s clear that the HOAT coolant has an exceptionally long lifetime. You can go five years or 100,000 miles between changes.However, the OAT coolant lasts even longer. It?s designed for up to ten years or 150,000 miles. HOAT has a reduced lifespan because it is mixed with IAT, which needs to be changed every two years or 30,000 miles. Even though HOAT has a shorter lifespan, it provides superior corrosion protection. 3. PriceBoth HOAT and OAT are going to cost far more than IAT. However, among the two, HOAT is the lower-cost option.You could spend about $30 a gallon for HOAT coolant. On the other hand, the OAT gallon might be somewhere between $50 and $65. If you want to get the best price on either of these coolant types, check online. While you might have to wait a few extra days to get your hands on the coolant, the savings will be far worth the wait. However, stay away from any sellers that have the price too good to be true. You don?t want to put any sub-par fluid into your car, or you might face bigger problems down the road. "
How to Find the Right Coolant for my Car ?	"There was a time when drivers would pick the coolant based on the color of what are already in the system. These days, this isn?t a great way to choose a coolant. Several types of coolants use varying colors, so you only want to rely on solid information. Additionally, when you purchase your coolant, read the label carefully to ensure you?ve chosen the right kind.If you don?t know what coolant your car uses, reference the owner?s manual. It tells you exactly what type of fluids to use during regular maintenance. If you don?t have the owner?s manual, you might be able to find a pdf file online. Additionally, you can reach out to your local dealership to get the information. While the owner?s manual is going to recommend an OEM formula, you should be able to find a comparable aftermarket version if you prefer. "
Is Hoat coolant the best?	"Hoat coolant is a premium coolant that offers superior protection for your engine. It contains a special additive package that helps to prevent corrosion and protect against overheating. Overall, Hoat coolants are an excellent choice for protecting your engine and ensuring its longevity. However, you should always use the coolant suggested by your car manufacturer to avoid trouble."
Can Oat and Hoat coolant be mixed?	"No. HOAT coolants are not compatible with OAT or NOAT coolants, and should not be mixed, even if HOAT is a hybrid mix of OAT and IAT coolant. By mixing these you may lose some of the valuable benefits of HOAT."
What happens if I mix Hoat and OAT coolant?	"Mixing HOAT and OAT coolant can lead to many unwanted results. For example, it can create a slushie-like consistency that can damage your engine. The HOAT and OAT coolants are not compatible and should not be mixed."
Does it matter what brand of coolant I use?	"Yes. Different coolant brands have different compositions and properties. But as long as you choose a coolant that is made for your engine with the right specifications recommended by your car manufacturer, it should work well, although some brands may have better properties and quality than others."
How to Dispose of Antifreeze ?	"To dispose of antifreeze, you need to check the condition of the antifreeze first. Flush the old coolant from the vehicle and put it in a safe container. Dispose of your antifreeze to an appropriate recycling center, service station, or auto parts shop that will help you. 1.Check Antifreeze ConditionBefore you do anything with the antifreeze, you want to know what type you use and check on the condition. You should know if the antifreeze is used or unused, as well as diluted or undiluted. Fresh antifreeze can be dealt with differently because used coolant might contain heavy metals. While you will probably take either to the same disposal location, the organization may need to know what quality it is in.2.Flush CoolantIf you are taking the coolant from your car and replacing it, you must first start by getting the old antifreeze out. It?s important that you collect it appropriately if you want to dispose of it.Put on a pair of gloves to protect your skin. Carefully place your drain pan beneath where the drain plug is removed. Make sure the drain pan is large enough to collect all of the liquid without spilling any. Also, allow the coolant to run all the way out before moving the drain pan. 3.Transfer to Safe ContainerAfter the coolant is drained into the pan, you need to transfer it to an appropriate container. If it isn?t placed in a proper container, it could spill or leak, leading to a safety concern.Use containers made for holding these dangerous liquids. You can also use the original antifreeze containers that you emptied when you refilled the system. Until you are able to drop off the liquid, put the antifreeze in a safe location. 4.Dispose at an Appropriate LocationFind your local auto parts store, recycling center or service station that takes antifreeze. You can search these locations online or call around locally to see who can help. Remember to tell them what type of antifreeze you are using, whether it is used/unused and diluted/undiluted. You also want to verify the hours and days that the establishment is open. The last thing you want to do is transport the dangerous substance only to find out that they aren?t open for business. When you arrive at the recycling center, you turn in all of your containers. Some places offer this service for free, but you should be prepared to pay a small fee for recycling.5.Avoid Dangerous PracticesIt?s tempting to pour your antifreeze down the sink drain, but you should never do this. Also, you don?t want to pour it out outside on the grass or dirt. Antifreeze is a toxic substance. It brings harm to animals and people that come in contact with it. It?s also not good for the environment, which is yet another reason to avoid the practice. Take a few minutes of your time to dispose of it correctly for the well-being of everyone involved. "
what are Antifreeze?	"Antifreeze is an engine coolant that gets mixed with water. It?s used to regulate the engine temperature, keeping the motor from overheating. This liquid is just as important as the motor oil and transmission fluid.The modern antifreeze mixes together with water to reduce the freezing temperature of the water. It also increases the boiling point. The liquid gets pumped throughout the engine, removing the heat from the motor. It also helps to prevent corrosion. You should change the antifreeze in your car every 30,000 to 60,000 miles. Check the owner?s manual to see what?s recommended for your vehicle?s make and model. Antifreeze is a glycol-based substance created with propylene glycol. Antifreeze used to be made out of ethylene glycol. However, the ingredients were changed once the toxicity in children and pets became apparent. Part of the cause of the trouble was the excessively sweet taste and smell that attracted kids and pets who didn?t know any better.However, both ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are considered toxic substances. You will find most of today?s antifreeze products are made from propylene glycol, but there are still some brands that use ethylene glycol. Either way, you must remain cautious and store the antifreeze safely"
What?s Toxic about Antifreeze?	"Antifreeze is toxic because of the glycol it contains. This chemical is harmful to pets and people. However, there are two types with varying levels of toxicity. Here are the two you want to know about.Ethylene Glycol Antifreeze: This is the more toxic of the two. It?s not used as frequently as it once was. When this chemical is ingested, it can damage the kidneys, lungs, liver and brain. Ultimately, it leads to organ failure and death, especially if left untreated. Plus, ethylene glycol harms the reproductive system and can create birth defects when pregnant. The worst part is that this antifreeze contains a sweet smell and taste, making it even more appealing to those who should stay away from it. Propylene Glycol Antifreeze: This is the most used type of antifreeze today and is an ingredient in the majority of products found in the store today. Propylene glycol is considered to be less poisonous than the previous version. However, you should still use it with care because it can create harm. If it were to be ingested in large quantities, it could cause irreparable harm. Whatever type of antifreeze you use, it?s important to care for it the right way, store it safely and dispose of it properly."
Can I pour antifreeze down the toilet?	"No, antifreeze is very poisonous and will harm the environment and wildlife if it gets into water supplies. It can also be corrosive and damage your plumbing. Take your old antifreeze to a service station or recycling center."
Does antifreeze evaporate on the ground?	"Antifreeze will eventually evaporate on the ground, but it will take a very long time. This also depends on whether it is mixed coolant and how much water it contains. The water will evaporate much faster than the antifreeze."
Is coolant bad for the environment?	"Yes, most coolants are bad for the environment. However, it also depends on the type of coolant and how it?s disposed of. Most coolants contain chemicals that are very harmful to the environment"
Where can you get rid of antifreeze?	"To get rid of antifreeze, you can take it to a service center, recycling center or your local auto parts store. Many auto part stores can actually help you get rid of it, so it might be worth a shot if you don?t have a recycling center nearby."
How to Remove Freeze Plugs/Core Plugs ?	"To remove freeze plugs, you might be able to push them out, depending on the condition of the freeze plugs. Otherwise, it might be necessary to pry them out with a special tool or screw them out. If all else fails, you can seal them as a temporary solution, but this isn?t for long-term usage. Here are some more detailed steps on how to remove freeze plugs:1. Push ItWith the help of a hammer and screwdriver, you can push out the corroded freeze plugs from the engine block. Place the flat end of your screwdriver into the edge of the freezer plug. Gently tap on it with the hammer until you start to see the plug rise out of the hole and protrude.Be very careful that the freeze plug doesn?t get pushed into the engine block, or you will have bigger problems. If you need to, spend time hitting the side of the core plug and grab it with a set of lock pliers to remove it. 2. Pry ItThis is the suggested method, but it can be a little expensive. You can use a special plug remover to get around the plug and remove it. If you choose one of the tools that don?t require you to drill a hole in it, you will need to pay more.However, these tools are some of the most effective. Take your time and pry it out gently so you don?t cause any other damage.Here is one tool you can use. Ensure it will fit on your car?s freeze plugs before buying it, though. This is an affiliate link, which means that at no cost to you, I may receive a small commission for qualifying purchases.3. Screw ItIf you can get a good hold of the freeze plug, it isn?t as hard to get it out. To do this, you want to drill a hole directly into the plug. From here, you can insert a screwdriver into the hole and pull the plug out. If the center of the plug has already rusted, you might be able to get a screwdriver inside without drilling a new hole. There are also special tools that can be used to complete this task if you don?t mind spending a little money. 4. Seal ItIf there is a minimal hole around the plug, you might not need to remove it right away. You can utilize a liquid block sealer to close up the hole temporarily. You won?t want to rely on this short-term fix for long, because it could lead to further damage. It?s only meant to get you by for a short time until you can visit your local mechanic for a fix. "
how to Prevent Damage to Freeze Plugs ?	"The best way to protect the freeze plugs is by using the appropriate coolant in the system. Don?t add water other than what?s needed to mix with the antifreeze. Otherwise, the water could freeze and cause the plugs to become dislodged. Additionally, if you live in a colder climate, you should invest in an engine block heater. This heater is attached to a 110-volt cable, and ensures the motor gets the warmth it needs to remain in good condition and start seamlessly. It?s a decent expense upfront, costing an average of $100-$400 for the parts and labor, but it can save you a lot of headaches down the road. "
What are Freeze Plugs/Core Plugs?	"The core plugs are an essential part of the common automotive motor. Most drivers don?t check on the freeze plugs because they rarely go bad. In fact, they are made to last for the lifetime of the motor. Still, they can fail over time, leading to permanent failure of the engine if not repaired quickly. These small plugs are cylindrical-shaped and used to fill up the passages on the engine that are created from the sand cores. When the engine is produced, small passages are added that allow for removal of the cast. When all is said and done, the passages must be filled to protect from coolant leaks. That?s where the freeze plugs come in. There was a time when plain water was used to cool down the combustion engine. While this method was good at removing the heat from the engine, the water could easily freeze when the temperatures dropped. Once the water froze inside the engine, the freeze plugs would push out to protect the block. Today, engines use coolant to protect the motor. This coolant doesn?t freeze, so there should be no reason for the core plugs to push out. "
Why Do Freeze Plugs Fail?	"The most common reason for core plugs to fail is because of freezing. If the coolant or water in an engine freezes, the plugs are going to push out to protect the block. Because water expands as it freezes, the pressure inside the block creates an expansion. With the freeze plugs popping out, the passages are expanded and the block won?t crack as easily. If a freeze plug fails, it needs to be replaced. With it popping out of the engine, there is an opening to the cooling system. Coolant will leak through this hole and fail to do its job. However, sometimes the plug doesn?t pop all the way out. "
what the Signs of Bad Freeze Plugs ?	"The most common sign that a freeze plug is defective is that coolant leaks out of the vehicle. If it has popped out of the engine block slightly, it can allow a leak. This leak severity depends on if the plug is still intact or has come out completely. If you only see dribbles of fluid, there?s probably only a small gap. The cost to replace freeze plugs can be anywhere from $100-$1,000, depending on your car type and where you take it for service. However, if you can perform the replacement yourself, you can save a lot of money."
 Why There Is Oil In Your Coolant Reservoir ?	"Coolant should be in the cooling system, and engine oil should be in the engine. If you find oil in the coolant reservoir, you know there is a severe problem. Here's whyCoolant Reservoir CarWere you about to fill your car with coolant when you realized that there is a lot of oil in the coolant reservoir?You?ve probably heard before that oil together with coolant is a very bad sign, but is it actually true?In this article, we will go through everything you have to know about oil and coolant mixed together ? the common causes of it and how you can diagnose and prevent it. So let?s take a quick look at what could cause oil to be in the coolant reservoir."
what are the Causes of Engine Oil In The Coolant Reservoir ?	"The most common cause of oil in the coolant reservoir is due to a blown head gasket or a cracked oil/coolant heat exchanger. It can also be caused by a faulty transmission cooler. In rare cases, it happens because of cracks in the engine.Before replacing any parts, you should be sure that no one filled the coolant reservoir with engine oil by mistake. Depending on the age of a car, it is also possible that a little bit of oil slipped into the coolant over the years. So if you haven?t changed the coolant in a few years, it can just be a sign that you need to change the coolant.If you need to take a closer look, here is a more detailed list of why you may have oil in the coolant reservoir:1. Damaged Head GasketHead GasketUnfortunately, the most common problem causing oil in your coolant reservoir is a bad or leaking head gasket. I say ?unfortunately? because replacing it is often quite a large job, and is thus usually very costly.There?s a rubber or metal seal right between the head and the engine block in your engine called the head gasket. Its sole purpose is to provide an airtight seal as the head is fitted onto the block, meaning they are two different parts.The head gasket ensures that the combustion?s air pressure doesn?t fire-up, and the oil that?s in the engine doesn?t leak out. If an engine overheats and stays heated up for prolonged periods without cooling, the head gasket can blow, causing oil to leak into the coolant system. This is why some oil may be getting into the coolant reservoir.Because of the expense of replacing the head gasket, I do recommend checking out the other parts first and making a proper diagnosis before replacement.2. Faulty Oil/Coolant Heat ExchangerOil Coolant Heat ExchangerOn a lot of modern cars, there is an oil cooler installed on your car, which is cooled by the coolant. Sometimes a gasket or a crack could occur inside the oil heat exchanger, and it will cause the oil and coolant to mix.This part is often much easier to replace than a head gasket, and cheaper as well. It?s also a very common problem, so I recommend checking the oil heat exchanger if you have one fitted to your vehicle.This often causes the coolant to pour into the oil pan, rather than oil leaking into the coolant system.3. Cracks in the cylinder headCylinder HeadOverheating damages the cylinders over time, cracking them in certain places, and allowing air and oil to leak out. The cylinder head can also be warped if the engine overheats, which will cause the head gasket to leak.Fixing cracks in the cylinder head is often very difficult and, in a few cases, even impossible. It often requires welding, which can be difficult in some places.It is often easier and cheaper to replace the cylinder head with another used one. Although this problem is comparatively uncommon, it can let oil into the coolant reservoir as you drive.However, you should always check other possible causes first and really make sure that it is the cylinder head that is causing it.4. Cracks in the engine blockEngine BlockIf you find cracks in your car?s engine block itself, unfortunately, you will probably need a new engine block, as it is often very difficult to weld it.This usually happens if the engine lacks the proper oiling and cooling. The engine block cracks due to extreme and prolonged heat build-up, allowing residue oil into the coolant reservoir and into other places, as well.Fixing this would be the most expensive option, as one would need to replace the whole engine. Repairing or rebuilding the old engine block is often more expensive than buying a new one.Proper diagnosis should be made before replacing the engine block, of course.5. Faulty Transmission Fluid CoolerTransmission Oil CoolerAre you sure it is actually engine oil that is in the cooling system? Actually, the transmission also has a heat exchanger that cools the transmission fluid by using the coolant, which could enter the cooling system if there is a crack.Usually, when there is a crack in the transmission fluid cooler, the coolant goes into the transmission fluid. However, it is always possible that some of the transmission fluid also enters the coolant system.However, this is not very common, and most cars do not even have this transmission heat exchanger. Instead, most automatic transmission vehicles have a transmission cooler installed at the front of the vehicle that is cooled by the airflow when driving at higher speeds.6. Someone added oil there by mistakeFill CoolantDid you recently buy the car or let a questionable mechanic do any work on your vehicle before? It?s possible that someone filled the cooling system with something other than coolant.It may sound ridiculous, but I can tell you that it happens more often than you may think.If you were unable to find any leaks in the oil or cooling systems, this might just be the answer to your conundrum."
How To Fix Oil in the Coolant Reservoir?	"The first thing you should do if you notice oil in the coolant reservoir is to pressure test the system. If you pressure-tested the system and everything seems fine, you might want to remove the coolant from the reservoir and keep driving the car to monitor if any new oil appears in the reservoir.Determining if there is a leak in the oil or cooling system is often quite easy. The tricky part is finding where the leak is coming from.There is an easy way to test if there is a leak in the oil or coolant system.The easiest way is to put pressure on the coolant system and see if it?s pouring out into the oil pan. To do this, you need a coolant pressure tool for the coolant system with the right adapter for your coolant expansion tank.They are quite expensive, so you might want to let a workshop do this for you, or borrow one. You can find one here at Amazon if you want one. This is an affiliate link, which means that at no cost to you, we may receive a small commission for qualifying purchases.Remove the Coolant Reservoir or Radiator CapApply 22 PSI or 1.5 bar pressure with a pressure tool.Let it stand for 10 minutes. If it loses pressure during that time, you have a leak in your coolant system; it may be either an internal or external leak.Check for any external coolant leaks under your vehicle.If you can?t find any external leaks but are still losing pressure, check for any coolant in the oil by looking at the dipstick, or tap out the engine oil and examine it that way.Remove the oil heat exchanger if you have one on your car model and inspect the gaskets and search for cracks. Replace it if it looks old and dry.Remove the head gasket and check for any damage. If you can?t find any damage or signs of oil mixing between the oil and coolant channels, enlist an expert to help check for cracks in the head or the engine block."
Can I Seal it with a Coolant Leak Repair Additive?	"As you may know by now, when the oil and coolant are mixed, it can cause a lot of further engine problems that may destroy your whole engine.Because of this, I do strongly recommend always repairing the problem properly instead of trying any additive.Repairing the problems causing the oil in the coolant reservoir can often be quite expensive, though, so if you have an ancient car that is just going to drive for a little bit more, you might decide you want to risk leaving the problem unaddressed. It?s up to you if you want to risk the whole engine!Remember that these sealers can cause other important parts in the cooling system to clog as well!"
Why is the mixing of these liquids harmful to the engine?	"Coolant and engine oil are two completely different liquids that serve different purposes, which is why the two should never be mixed together.The reasoning behind this lies in the liquids? chemical properties. Oil is a thick viscous substance, while coolant is water-like. The engine relies completely on oil for lubrication, which coolants and water cannot offer. That should make it clear that oil and coolant cannot go together."
How Much Coolant Should Be in the Overflow Tank?	"The coolant reservoir or overflow tank should be filled by at least 30%. On the side of the tank, you should see marker lines that show you the minimum and maximum levels to fill it to. Ideally, you should fill it slightly higher than the minimum line and keep a close eye on it.It?s important that you know how to check the coolant levels to ensure the system is adequately cooling your car motor. With a quick glance at the reservoir, you can tell if the system has enough coolant. The minimum line might be marked with an ?L? for low. It could also have an ?F,? meaning Full. If the coolant goes below the L or minimum line, you need to add more. If it has risen above the F or maximum line, you need to flush out some of the contents. Running the system with too little or too much coolant can be dangerous either way. "
Why Coolant is Important ?	"Coolant is a liquid designed to transfer heat from the engine to prevent damage. It also prevents freezing in colder temperatures. The overflow tank plays an important role in the cooling system of your vehicle. It?s responsible for holding the coolant that circulates through the system. While the car is running and the motor temperature rises, additional coolant will flow into the overflow tank from the engine. However, when the engine is cool, the excess flows back into the motor. For this reason, the levels in the coolant tank are constantly changing. "
Why Does Coolant Reservoir Tank Overflow?	"1. Excessive Coolant FluidThe most obvious reason that the tank is overflowing is that you filled it too high. Even if it looks normal with the car engine off, the levels are going to fluctuate once it?s running.It?s important to keep the levels between the minimum and maximum markings. These indicators leave room for expansion when there is more coolant in the tank. 2. Bad Radiator CapIf the radiator cap gets loose or becomes damaged, the coolant isn?t going to remain where it is supposed to. The cap is responsible for maintaining a closed system. However, when the cap is bad, pressures get altered, and the engine could easily overheat. An overheating engine leads to excessive amounts of fluid in the tank, causing it to possibly overflow.Thankfully, it?s not difficult to replace a broken radiator cap. You just have to find the one that?s compatible with your system because it needs to be built for a specific amount of pressure. 3. Defective Water PumpA faulty water pump can slow down or halt the flow of coolant entering the system. When the pump breaks or is damaged, the engine overheats. Not only can this lead to fluid filling up the tank, but it can also create a leak around the pump itself.The cost to replace a water pump is about $400 to $650. This expense includes both the part and possible labor charges.4. Malfunctioning ThermostatThe thermostat is used to determine how much coolant is required to reduce engine temperature. If the thermostat is faulty, the engine can?t utilize the right information and cooling might not occur as it should. With the inability to regulate the fluid, the tank could overflow and the engine might overheat. Thankfully, this replacement is a little less than some of the others. You might spend $150 to $300 to have a new thermostat installed. 5. Cracked Block or HeadIf you notice boiling liquid or gas bubbles in the overflow tank, there might be a major issue with the engine block or cylinder head. In some cases, it could be due to a blown head gasket, but it could also be a cracked block or head.Sadly, these issues require major engine repair. In some cases, you might need a new engine installed. You could easily spend thousands of dollars with either a blown head gasket or a cracked block. 6. Bad RadiatorThe problem could also be coming from a bad radiator. Today?s radiators are often built with a lightweight plastic material, making them less durable than they once were. Older radiators were designed with aluminum and copper for additional durability. If you have a clogged radiator, it can lead to an excessive amount of fluid in the tank. For the most part, you would spend about $250 to $500 to have a new radiator installed. To prevent further issues, you want to have this vital part replaced at the first sign of wear.  "
How to Check Coolant Levels ?	"It?s not difficult to check the coolant level. Ideally, you would take a peek at the tank every other gas fill-up, just to be sure everything is running right. Here are some basic steps to follow.Find the reservoir tank.Take note of where the coolant level is located based on the minimum and maximum lines printed on the side of the tank. The coolant color should help make it simple to see where the level is at. However, if the tank is dusty, you might need to clean it off first. Ideally, you want the coolant level to be slightly over the minimum line because it will rise higher when hot. If you need to add more coolant, it?s best to do it with the car engine off.Use the appropriate coolant for your vehicle, laid out in the owner?s manual. After filling the tank, keep a close eye on the levels. Pop the hood occasionally just to see where things stand. If you notice something wrong, you can fix it before the problem gets larger. "
Should I Add Water to Coolant Overflow Tank?	"If the engine is overheating and you need to cool it down quickly, water can be used in a pinch, but it isn?t highly recommended. It?s only to be used to get you home. Water doesn?t contain the same corrosion-protecting properties that coolant or antifreeze have. It?s not designed to work in the cooling system the same way. Not only do you leave the system vulnerable without this protection, but water will freeze when the temperatures drop. If you are driving in winter weather, you don?t want to put water in the system, as it can create a whole mess of other problems."
Reasons Why Your Car Temperature Gauge Stays on Cold ?	"The most common reason why your car?s temperature gauge stays on cold is a faulty coolant temperature sensor. It can also be caused by bad wiring between the cluster and the sensor. In some cases, it can also be a stuck thermostat causing the engine not to heat up properly.Let?s go a little bit more into detail about the different causes. Here is a more detailed list of the most common reasons why a temperature gauge stays on cold.1. Faulty Engine Coolant Temperature SensorCoolant Temp SensorsAs we talked about, the most common problem with a faulty engine temperature reading is the coolant temperature sensor itself sending wrong information to the cluster.Some cars have two temperature sensors, while other car models have just one. The models with one sensor usually use the same sensor for both the engine control unit?s temperature and the gauge.If your car model has two coolant temperature sensors, one is used by the temperature gauge, and the other one is used for the engine control module.Engine temperature sensors are easy to measure with a multimeter, but you need to find the correct values for them. You can also find more information on how to test them in a repair manual. We will talk more about how to diagnose the sensor properly later in the article.However, if you decide to replace one of them, and your car has two sensors, you should make sure to replace the sensor going to the temperature gauge.2. Broken WiringsBroken WiringsIf you have two temperature sensors on your car (one separate for the gauge), you need to check the sensor?s wires to the gauge or ohm measure the sensor from the cluster connector.If you have one sensor for both of them, there could either be a problem with the wires between the sensor and the ECU (most likely) or a wiring problem between the gauge and the ECU. Check for any broken wires between these components.The best way to find broken wiring is to measure the resistance with a multimeter from all the wires? directions. However, this requires a bit of electronic car knowledge, and you may have to let your mechanic take a look at it without it. You can also find information about this in your repair manual. Check a wiring diagram of your car to measure the wiring correctly.3. Faulty Gauge/ClusterInstrument ClusterThe next problem is a faulty temperature gauge. However, most temperature gauges are integrated with the instrument cluster on modern cars. In some cases, you can replace the temperature gauge or repair any bad solderings if you find any.In other clusters, you might have to replace the whole instrument cluster. You can often take your instrument cluster to an expert to repair the soldering if you do not know how to do it yourself.A faulty cluster is not a very common problem, though, and they are often pretty expensive and need programming after replacement. Therefore it is recommended to check the other things first before you decide to replace the cluster.You can also test the cluster temperature gauge with an Ohm tester if you have some knowledge.4. Corrosion in plug connectorsCoolant Temperature Sensor LocationCorrosion in the connectors is also a common problem when it comes to a faulty temperature gauge. Clean and spray electronic cleaner in the connector at the sensor, the engine control unit?s connector, and the cluster?s connector.If corrosion appears, there might be a problem with the connectors? sealings, and you may have to take a look at these to make a permanent repair or to replace them to avoid future problems.5. Bad ThermostatThermostat HousingThe thermostat restricts the coolant from flowing through the radiator. If this gets stuck wide open, the temperature might not reach the optimal level.However, this will often make your temperature go up a bit from the minimum mark if you drive hard enough. If your temperature gauge is going up slowly, you might have a problem with the thermostat. You can read more about thermostats here: Faulty Thermostat Symptoms & Causes6. Air in the Cooling systemBleeding Coolant SystemAir in the cooling system can also cause the temperature gauge to stay cold if there is an air bubble right at the sensor spot. This can also often be indicated with a fluctuating coolant temperature gauge.If you suspect air in the coolant system, you have to bleed your coolant system with a unique bleeding technique. If you want to learn more about this, you can check out our guide: Coolant Bleeding.7. Broken Engine Control UnitEngine Control UnitThis only applies if your car uses one combined temperature sensor with two pins.In some rare cases, your engine control unit could be a problem if the temperature information is received first by the ECM, which therefore sends the data to the cluster.If this is the case, you have to check the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner in the engine control unit to see if the engine control unit receives the temperature informat"
How To Fix A Car Temperature Gauge That Stays On Cold ?	"To fix a car temperature gauge that stays on cold, you will first want to read the trouble codes with an OBD scanner and then diagnose the coolant temperature sensor. You?ll also want to inspect the wiring and check the thermostat.1. Read Trouble CodesDiagnose CarWhenever you have a problem related to the engine of modern cars, you always want to read the fault codes with an OBD2 scanner. These codes will give you a lot of valuable information, and you can save a lot of money and time by doing this.For example, if you find a code related to the temperature gauge, you want to start diagnosing there. We have a trouble code library here at Mechanic Base where you can find information on many trouble codes you may encounter.2. Diagnose Coolant Temperature SensorWhen you have problems with your car?s temperature, you want to locate and diagnose the coolant temperature sensor first. Keep in mind that cars may have a separate coolant temperature sensor for the engine and for the radiator fan, so you?ll want to check a repair manual to make sure you?re looking at the correct sensor.Once you find the sensor, you?ll want to find the correct ohm values from a chart that matches your car model, then measure the sensor with a multimeter. If you get faulty values from the sensor, it?s time to replace it.3. Test The ThermostatOld Car ThermostatYou also want to make sure that it?s not actually the coolant that is cold, caused by a stuck open thermostat. To measure the thermostat, you need to use a laser thermometer and check the temperature coming out of the engine.If you see warm coolant coming out of the engine, even though the engine is not hot, you probably want to remove the thermostat and check its functions.4. Contact A ProfessionalModern cars can be quite difficult to work on if you don?t have the right knowledge and there is no shame in asking for help. While taking your car to a repair shop can be expensive, it doesn?t necessarily have to be because mechanics are often quite quick to diagnose problems like this.If you don?t have the right knowledge, you can waste money replacing parts that are fully functional and in this case it would be cheaper to take it to a mechanic in the first place."
Is it bad if my car temperature is cold?	"Yes, if your thermostat is stuck open and the engine never gets up to operating temperature, it?s bad for the engine and fuel consumption in the long run. The car engine is most efficient when it reaches operating temperature, and it will also wear less on the engine parts."
How do I unstick a stuck thermostat?	"The only way to loosen a stuck thermostat is to do it manually by removing it. But if your thermostat is stuck, you?ll most likely want to replace it, or you could end up in the same situation in the near future. They are quite inexpensive."
How do I know if my thermostat is stuck open?	"One way to tell if the thermostat is stuck open is to check the outlet radiator hose. The hose should not have any coolant circulation while the engine is warming up and, therefore, should remain cold until the engine reaches operating temperature. If it is the same temperature as the inlet hose during the heating process, it is probably stuck open."
How do I reset my temperature gauge?	"There is no way to reset your temperature gauge in most car models. If you have a rare car model where it?s possible, you need to check a repair manual for your particular car model."
Conclusion	"The temperature gauge staying cold is a serious problem that needs to be fixed. This can be done by checking the cooling system, engine components, and electrical system. It?s not good for your engine to run without reaching the operating temperature; this will cause wear and tear over time.If you are not comfortable doing this yourself, take it to a mechanic or dealer. With proper care and maintenance, your car will last longer and perform better."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Water Pump ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad water pump are coolant leaks under your car and an overheating engine. You can sometimes also hear a squealing noise coming from the water pump if the bearings are bad. Unstable engine temperature is also common.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing water pump to look for:1. Leaking of CoolantCoolant Leaking E1609789888621When the water pump goes bad, it may leak from the axle sealing or any gasket. The water pump uses gaskets that ensure the coolant stays sealed and that the flow of water is uninterrupted. However, these gaskets can deteriorate and become completely useless in time, causing the coolant to leak out from under the water pump. If you have a puddle of water or coolant below the front end of your car, you are probably looking at water pump failure, and so you need to go to a mechanic.2. Squealing NoiseEngine Squealing Noise E1609789879322When the water pump goes bad, it may leak coolant into the bearings of the water pump, which will dry out the bearings of grease and therefore create a squealing noise when the engine is running. If you hear a squealing noise from the water pump you should replace the water pump as fast as possible, as it may be fatal to your engine to keep driving ? especially if the water pump is driven by the timing belt.3. Water Pump?s Axle loseWater Pump Bad E1609789871700There is a serpentine or timing belt making the water pump turn and pump coolant. If the water pump axle gets worn out, it may cause a loose belt. If this happens, you are looking at a complete replacement of the water pump. To feel if the water pump?s axle is loose, you have to remove the serpentine or timing belt. If you feel any play in the axle, replace it immediately.4. Overheating EngineOverheating Engine E1609789863111The water pump?s primary job is to pump coolant around the system to cool the engine. If the water pump fails somehow, you will see the temperature gauge rising on the dashboard. This can happen due to several reasons, such as thermostat failure or short electrical wiring, but you should always get it checked out by a certified mechanic. Otherwise, you are looking at widespread damage to the head gasket, the cylinders, and the pistons, all of which can reduce the overall life of your engine.5. White Smoke From The RadiatorWhite Smoke Radiator E1609789853150If you see white smoke coming out of your radiator, you are looking at a clear sign of water pump failure. The steam in the radiator is produced from an overheated engine, which can happen if the water pump is not working perfectly. When faced with this problem, it is better to stay safe and stop driving, wait for the engine to cool down, and try to reach your mechanic.6. Unstable Engine temperatureCar Temperature Meter E1609789949889You can also notice intermittent problems with the water pump, as the impeller might be loose on the water pump axle. This will cause the car to overheat sometimes, and at other times work fine for a couple of weeks. It?s always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to water pumps, though, so you should replace it if you think it?s bad."
what are a water pump?	"The water pump plays an important role in the healthy functioning of the engine. The pump regulates the amount of coolant that goes into the engine. Its job is to constantly supply the engine with fresh and cool liquid from the radiator to work properly.However, when the water pump fails ? and they do regularly fail ? the engine will not get the correct amount of coolant and heat up. That?s just how water-cooled engines work: if there is no water, the engine cannot survive.Therefore, a well-functioning water pump is of crucial importance. If it fails, some symptoms will appear, which will prompt you to contact the mechanic to ensure the engine is in good condition."
Water Pump Location ?	"The water pump is always located near the serpentine belt, timing belt, or timing chain since it is powered by one of them. This means that it is also installed at the front of the engine.If the timing belt powers the water pump, it may be difficult to see it though. You may need to remove a lot of covers to see it.Start by checking near the serpentine belt for the water pump pulley. If you can?t find the water pump pulley, there is a big risk that the timing belt powers it."
what are the Causes of an Overheating Car Engine ?	"The most common causes of an overheating car engine are a low coolant level or a broken thermostat. If the overheating only happens during idle, it may be caused by a bad radiator fan. It can also be caused by a broken water pump or a blown head gasket.Down below, you will find a more detailed list of the possible causes. We?ll take a dive into the nine most common below before walking you through how to troubleshoot your vehicle.1. Low Coolant or No CoolantThe primary purpose of coolant is to cool down your engine. So, it?s no surprise that if your vehicle is low or out of coolant, your engine will overheat! Just keep in mind that your vehicle has a sealed cooling system, so if you?re constantly adding coolant, you need to figure out where it?s going.2. Broken ThermostatYour vehicle?s thermostat opens and closes as needed to keep your engine at the right temperature. If it?s stuck open or closed, your engine will overheat, which is a significant problem.The thermostat is usually located in a plastic house somewhere on your engine block or head, check your repair manual to find its location.3. Broken Water PumpYour vehicle?s water pump pushes the coolant throughout the engine. Without it, your coolant is sitting stagnant and can?t do its job.Keep in mind that while your vehicle?s water pump can break, it?s one of the rarer problems, depending on the car model.4. Broken FanIf your vehicle only overheats while idling, you should double-check that the fan is working correctly. The fan pushes air over the radiator to keep it cool, which is especially important while your vehicle is idling.5. Clogged or Damaged RadiatorYour vehicle?s coolant flows through the radiator?s fins to cool down, and if those fins are clogged or blocked, you won?t get enough coolant flow through your engine to effectively cool it down.Another problem is if debris blocks the front of your radiator. While this is less common, just make sure that air can easily flow over your radiator while driving.6. Coolant LeakWhile we highlighted low coolant earlier, an internal coolant leak can have your engine overheating even after you stop the oil off. That?s because if your coolant is mixing with other things, like your oil, nothing is going to cool down as it should.Any kind of coolant leak can lead to your engine overheating in short order.7. Air Pockets in Your CoolantAfter a coolant flush, you need to make sure that you get all of the air pockets out of the cooling system. Air pockets will cause your entire system to jam up, and you won?t get any coolant flow.The exact instructions to bleed your coolant system will vary by vehicle, so check out the maintenance manual for your specific vehicle to figure out the steps you need to follow. Air pockets in your coolant can also be caused by a blown head gasket which can also result in an overheating engine.8. Low Coolant PressureThere are a few different reasons that your coolant might not be building pressure. You might have a busted radiator cap, or you might have a leak or busted water pump. Either way, low coolant pressure is going to lead to an overheating engine.9. Low OilThis is a very rare issue, but it can absolutely happen! Oil has several properties, but one of the critical ones is cooling. Without enough oil, engine components will create a lot more friction, which heats everything.If it gets too hot, your engine can overheat. If your engine is overheating, take a few extra seconds to check your oil level."
How To Fix an Overheating Car Engine ?	"While there might be many problems that can lead to an overheating engine, you can keep it from getting overwhelming if you KISS the problem. It?s what every mechanic instructor teaches, keep it simple stupid.It?s the mechanic?s version of Occam?s Razor. Start with the simplest and most likely problems before you jump down the rabbit hole and start tearing things apart. When troubleshooting an overheating engine, the simplest thing to check is your fluid levels.1. Check Fluid LevelsCheck the oil and the coolant, and if either fluid is low you?ve discovered a critical clue. While you can always top of the fluid and see if the problem goes away, keep in mind that both systems are sealed, so if fluids are disappearing, you have a problem you need to look into.2. Pressurize the systemWhen the engine has completely cooled off, get a radiator cap tester and put it on top of your radiator. This nifty device will allow you to pressurize your entire system, which will check a few different problems for you. If you don?t own one, don?t worry, most part stores like AutoZone will let you rent one for free.First, it will make it abundantly obvious if you have a leak ? whether internal or external. Your system should hold pressure. If it doesn?t, you have a leak somewhere.The next step is to check the thermostat. You can check this by checking the lower radiator hose?s temperature (or upper if that?s the output of the thermostat). If it is still cold when the car starts to overheat, you probably have an issue with the thermostat.Remember that if you have a broken electric thermostat, you will usually have a check engine light ? but that?s not always the case. If your thermostat checks out, take a look at your fan. Pop the hood and run your engine. At some point, the fan should kick on. If it doesn?t, you either have an electrical problem with the fan or a busted fan.Finally, you need to make sure that you have coolant flow in your engine which requires some skills, and you should probably consult a mechanic to make a deeper diagnosis of your coolant system."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Car Thermostat ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad thermostat are an overheating engine or an engine that will never reach the operating temperature. You may also notice a fluctuating temperature on the temperature gauge.The symptoms give you a warning in advance to take the necessary precautions. Here is a more detailed list of the most common signs of a bad or failing thermostat to look for:1. Overheating EngineOverheating Engine On Road E1609868232525When the car thermostat remains stuck closed, the hot coolant cannot flow to the radiator. Because the hot fluid cannot be cooled down, it keeps the temperature of the engine up higher than normal.Coolant needs to make its way to the radiator to be cooled down. Once this occurs, it comes back to the engine and dissipates more of the heat. However, with the stuck thermostat, the coolant remains stagnant, continuing to build up more heat.If the engine overheats, it can cause serious damage. For example, if you end up with a blown head gasket, you are looking at massive repair bills.However, an overheating engine isn?t always caused by a bad thermostat. You want to check the coolant levels to ensure you have enough fluid in the system. It could also be due to a bad water pump or a cooling system leak. Additionally, the radiator could become clogged. Still, the thermostat should be one of the parts you examine. 2. Trouble Reaching Operating TemperatureIf the opposite were true from the above complaint, the thermostat would be stuck open. When this happens, the coolant is able to flow freely to the radiator. Without coolant sitting in the engine for an extended period of time, the operating temperature might fail to reach normal limits. Not only will the engine struggle to increase temperature, but it will also have trouble maintaining its range.When the engine doesn?t get warm enough, it?s going to be less efficient. You might notice that the motor is using more fuel than usual, costing you additional money at the pump. This problem can also lead to premature wear of the engine components. 3. Temperature FluctuationsFluctating Temperature Gauge E1609868224282When the thermostat starts to fail, it might operate erratically. Sometimes, it could be stuck open when it should be closed and vice versa. This malfunction leads to temperature fluctuations in the engine that aren?t normal. When the thermostat doesn?t fail uniformly, it can create mixed signals. You will notice strange temperature readings, leading you to wonder what are causing the problem. However, a quick check of the thermostat might reveal that this is the culprit. 4. Heater fluctuationsFluctating Heat Temperature E1609868216893The coolant heats up the heater in your car. Therefore, if the thermostat is not doing its job properly to maintain an even temperature in the car?s engine, you may experience temperature fluctuations inside the car from the vents.If both your temperature gauge and the heat inside the car fluctuate, it is definitely time to check the thermostat.5. Possible Leakages & Steam from the engineWhite Steam From Engine E1609868206958If the thermostat is not working properly, the hot coolant in the engine coolant chamber will find a way to escape because of too high pressure. We all know that hot air rises and that water boils and forms steam when it heats up.When the coolant heats up, and the pressure gets too high, it can attack the weak points and cause a leak. The coolant is often pressed out of the radiator tankLeaks are often straightforward to detect because they are visible and often show up in white steam smoke.6. Rising Temperature and Full Expansion TankExpansion Tank E1609868242307If the thermostat flap remains closed, no coolant can escape from the radiator. The coolant inside heats up and begins to convert to steam, while the coolant inside the radiator remains unchanged.So if you see the temperature gauge rise and the radiator tank is filled with water, you most likely have a problem with the thermostat. A rising coolant level can also mean that the car is about to overheat.7. Poor PerformanceThe thermostat is a critical component designed to ensure that the engine is always running at its optimal temperature. Without it, the engine won?t operate as it should.When the motor isn?t running right, you are going to notice performance issues. Most notably, the fuel economy is going to suffer as the engine works harder to compensate for the temperature discrepancies. If the engine is overheating or unable to reach temperature, there could also be increased emissions from the fault. Not only is the bad thermostat putting the engine at risk for failure, but it?s also contributing to a polluted environment. "
How Does a Car Thermostat Work?	"The car thermostat?s job is to keep the engine?s temperature within its working limits. This small part sits between the engine and radiator, regulating coolant flow between the two parts. When the thermostat closes, the coolant isn?t able to flow. When it?s open, coolant flows to dissipate heat. Most car engines from the past few years operate at the same temperature range to ensure maximum performance. In general, the car engine should be around 195 to 220 degrees Fahrenheit. When it doesn?t run within these temperature guidelines, it?s not operating efficiently. When coolant is kept from flowing to the radiator, the engine temperature increases rapidly. On the other hand, as the coolant flows into the radiator, heat is quickly dissipated. The car thermostat operates as a gatekeeper. It?s either allowing or blocking coolant from flowing from the motor into the vehicle?s radiator. It?s the job of the thermostat to read the temperature of the engine and determine if the coolant needs to flow or not. If the engine is hot, the thermostat opens up and allows the coolant to move. Otherwise, when the engine remains cold, the thermostat stays closed. "
Thermostat Location ?	"The thermostat is often located in a plastic or metal housing near the water pump, connecting to the radiator?s lower hose.It is most often located on the housing that connects the radiator?s lower hose, but it can be the upper hose in some cars.Because it is often installed inside a housing, it is in most cases impossible to see with your own eyes without removing it, so using a repair manual is a good way to find the exact location of your car model."
Thermostat Replacement Cost ?	"The average thermostat replacement cost is between $70 and $450, depending on the car model and labor costs. A thermostat costs around $20 to $50, and the labor cost at a workshop is between $50 and $400.Some cars have a whole housing with the thermostat integrated, making it impossible to replace the thermostat alone. This can make the part very expensive.On some cars, the thermostat is placed really badly, requiring some hours of work, while on other cars, you can replace it yourself within 10 minutes.Check a repair manual to find out how much work it is to replace the thermostat on your car model."
How to Test a Bad Thermostat ?	"It doesn?t take a lot of mechanical knowledge to test the car thermostat. In fact, a simple visual exam is all you need to perform.Start by taking off the radiator cap. It?s under the hood, near the front of the vehicle, mounted to the radiator. Don?t ever open the radiator cap when the engine is hot. This test should only be done with a cold engine. Turn the car on and allow the motor to run. As you look inside the neck, you should not see coolant flowing to the radiator. As the engine is cool, the fluid should not be moving inside. If you already see coolant running, the thermostat is open when it shouldn?t be. If the coolant isn?t flowing while the engine is cold, everything is running as it should so far. Now, you want to allow the motor the chance to warm up. However, you need to be careful with the hot coolant, as it can cause injury.As the temperature rises in the motor, coolant will start flowing into the radiator. If you don?t see any coolant moving but the temperature is rising on the dashboard, the thermostat might be stuck closed. In either situation, you must address the problem to prevent further damage to your engine."
Can I  drive with a bad thermostat? 	"No. It?s not recommended to drive your car with a bad thermostat. If your thermostat is malfunctioning, it could cause your engine to overheat, which could lead to serious engine damage. It?s always best to get a faulty thermostat fixed as soon as possible. Otherwise, you?re risking some very costly repairs down the road."
Can I run a car without a thermostat?	"Although you can drive a car without a thermostat, it is not recommended. If you remove the thermostat, your car will not reach operating temperature. This will cause higher fuel consumption and wear your engine down faster."
Is it hard to change a car thermostat?	"Replacing a thermostat can be quite a tricky job for many people. Replacing the thermostat itself is often not that difficult, but properly bleeding the coolant system afterward can be tricky. In some car models, it can be very difficult to reach the thermostat as well."
Do I have to drain the coolant when replacing the thermostat?	"Yes. In most car models, the thermostat is located at the bottom of the coolant system, so when you remove the thermostat, you have no choice ? all the coolant in the engine drains by itself. Some car models have the thermostat placed quite high up, and in this case, it may be enough just to drain part of the coolant."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Radiator Fan ?	"1. Fan Doesn?t Come OnRadiator FansThe most common symptom that the radiator fan has gone bad is that it will stop working. Sometimes the motor burns up or fails. Other times, the relay stops working. Either way, you know there is an issue with the fan system if it is unable to run. If this condition is allowed to persist, it will lead to larger issues, as you are about to see.2. Blown Radiator Fan FuseRelay Fuse BoxAnother reason the fan will stop working is if it blows a fuse. Radiator fans will burn out a fuse because it is failing and creating too much amperage. When the electric motor surges, the fuses blow to ensure the system stays safe from this extra power. You can change the fuse, but a defective fan will probably cause another one to go out. 3. Vehicle OverheatingOverheating Engine On RoadThe fan is responsible for keeping the coolant at the right temperature. If the fan fails, engine temperatures will begin to rise. While the fan should turn on as soon as the temperature reaches a certain point, it won?t.Many times, drivers aren?t aware that the engine is overheating until the temperature light goes on the dashboard. At this point, you must shut down the car and let the engine cool, or you could cause irreversible damage. 4. Poor A/C Performance When the radiator fan stops working, you might notice difficulty with the air conditioning system. The radiator fan is supposed to pull air through the condenser and remove heat from the refrigerant. In fact, it creates double the amount of air compared with the condenser fan. With a defective radiator fan, it isn?t just the engine getting hotter, but also the cabin of the vehicle. What you think might be a problem with the A/C could actually be an issue with the radiator fan. 5. Whirring NoisesAny strange noises should be a cause for alarm. When the radiator cooling fan motor begins to fail, it can emit a whirring sound or loud clicking. These sounds can also occur if one of the fan blades becomes damaged and starts touching other components. If you are hearing sounds, at least you know the fan is still working, even minimally. However, it?s best to have this repaired before it leads to further problems. "
Radiator Fan Location ?	"The radiator cooling fan is mounted directly to the radiator. All late model vehicles are equipped with a radiator cooling fan. In some vehicles, there is more than one radiator cooling fan attached to the radiator. It?s possible to have one fail while the other continues to operate. "
what are The Function of a Radiator Fan ?	"The radiator fan pulls air through the radiator to cool the engine. It?s used heavily during lower speeds and idling, when air isn?t naturally being pushed through the system. When the engine is running, coolant temperatures rise. If no air moves through the radiator to cool it off, the engine starts to overheat. This operation is powered by the fan?s electric motors.As with most industrial motors, the electric fan?s motor works the same. It is a replaceable or serviceable component of the assembly. However, because it contains moving parts, it is subject to wear over time and can fail. Sometimes, a defective radiator fan isn?t caused by the fan itself, but by the motor that powers it. A complete inspection will be required to determine the cause of the malfunction. "
what are the Radiator Fan Replacement Cost ?	"The average radiator fan replacement cost is typically between $550 and $650. In many cases, the radiator fan will cost around $400 to $450, while the labor adds $150 to $200. However, some vehicles can be more expensive, depending on the design.Most cars have the radiator fan mounted directly on the radiator, making it simple to replace. If you know your way around some basic automotive tools and have some general expertise, you might be able to change the radiator fan yourself and save on labor costs. However, you should never drive with a failing radiator fan. If the fan fails to bring in cool air to the engine, you could cause severe damage to the motor as it overheats. The expense you will pay to replace the engine far outweighs the cost of a bad radiator fan."
how to test Cooling Fan ?	"Testing a car cooling fan is a relatively simple process that can be done with a few basic tools. Here are the steps to follow:Turn on the engine of the car and let it run until the temperature gauge reaches the normal operating level.Open the hood of the car and locate the cooling fan. The cooling fan is typically located near the radiator, and there may be one or two fans depending on the make and model of the car.Inspect the fan blades for any signs of damage or wear. If the blades are cracked or broken, the fan will need to be replaced.Turn off the engine of the car and remove the key from the ignition.Disconnect the electrical connector that is attached to the cooling fan. This connector is typically located near the fan or on the side of the radiator.Use a multimeter to test the voltage at the electrical connector. Set the multimeter to DC voltage and touch the positive lead to the positive terminal of the connector and the negative lead to the negative terminal of the connector. The reading should be between 12 and 14 volts.If there is voltage present at the connector, the next step is to test the fan motor. Connect the fan directly to the battery using a set of jumper wires. Connect the positive jumper wire to the positive terminal of the battery and the negative jumper wire to the negative terminal of the battery.If the fan motor does not turn on, it may be faulty and will need to be replaced.If the fan motor does turn on, the next step is to test the fan relay. The relay is typically located in the power distribution box under the hood. Consult the owner's manual for the exact location.Use a multimeter to test the continuity of the relay. Set the multimeter to the continuity setting and touch the positive lead to one of the relay terminals and the negative lead to another terminal. If there is continuity, the relay is working properly. If there is no continuity, the relay is faulty and will need to be replaced.Reconnect the electrical connector to the cooling fan and start the engine of the car. Let it run for a few minutes and check to see if the fan is turning on when the temperature gauge rises above the normal operating level.By following these steps, you should be able to test the car cooling fan and determine whether it is working properly or needs to be replaced. If you are unsure about any of the steps or if you do not feel comfortable working with electrical components, it is recommended that you take your car to a qualified mechanic for further diagnosis and repair."
what are the Different Methods To Bleed the Car?s Cooling System ?	"There are actually two different methods of getting the air out from your cooling system.Old Manual MethodThe manual method is the old-style variant of bleeding the cooling system.Some cars have one or more air bleed valves to get the air out from the system, and some cars don?t have this air bleed valve, which makes it a lot more difficult.To do this method, you do not need any special tools, and you will get a step-to-step guide on how to do it later in the article.Vacuum MethodThe new method, which I use myself, is the vacuum method. You need a vacuum tool for this and compressed air (depending on the tool) to use this method.However, this method creates a vacuum and sucks out all the air from the cooling system within seconds, and then fills all the vacuum space with the coolant. This is a really efficient method if you have the tool, and you will never have to worry about car cooling bleeding anymore. You will get a perfect result every time, and the process takes under a minute.If you are interested in one of these tools, you can find one here on Amazon. Please note you need an air compressor for this tool. This is an affiliate link, which means that at no cost to you, we may receive a small commission for qualifying purchases.If you do not feel that it is necessary to buy one of these tools and do not want to go to a workshop to do it, it is also fine. This is the way I do it when I do not have access to a vacuum bleeder:"
How to Bleed Your Cars Cooling System ?	"This is a guide on how to manually bleed your car?s cooling system without any special tools. Remember always to be careful when it comes to car cooling systems because it will reach boiling temperatures.It is much easier to do this if you are two people, so make sure to bring a friend! Follow these steps to bleed the coolant system easily:Total Time: 30 minutesStep 1: Get the Coolant ReadyCoolant MixThe first step in this guide is to make sure your anti-freeze is ready. You should always use the correct coolant that is required by your manufacturer. The wrong type of coolant could damage your engine!If you are not sure which coolant you should use, check your repair manual or contact your authorized dealer.Generally, mix the coolant with 50% water and 50% coolant (if it is a concentrated anti-freeze coolant).Always read the description of your coolant for the correct instructions. If you live in a cold country, you have to make sure that the coolant mix is correct. If your coolant freezes in your engine, it will destroy your engine.Step 2: Jack up the front of the carJack Up Car E1611338560184A step that not many people do but gets you a much better result is to raise the front of your vehicle first. With this method, you will get the air out of the car a lot easier, especially if your filling cap is at your radiator. If you have a car with an external expansion tank installed in the engine?s rear, this may not be necessary.To raise the car?s front, you could either use a floor jack or put the car on a steep hill with the front upwards.When raising your car with a floor jack, always also use Jack Stands to prevent any accidents.Step 3: Fill Coolant to MAXFill CoolantNow when the car front is raised, it?s time to fill your coolant as much as possible. If your engine has air bleed valves, open them simultaneously as you are adding the coolant. Close them when coolant is flowing out from them.Anti-freeze is toxic, and you should always check that your coolant is not flowing down in any wells on your floor or the road. All coolant should be returned to your local environmental assessment. Keep in mind that if any animals drink the coolant, they can get very sick, leading to death. Use anti-freeze with care! When you have filled your coolant as much as possible, go to the next stepStep 4: Start the engineStarting CarYou should now start your engine. The best way to do this is to get help from a friend. When you start your engine, the water pump could push out some coolant from the radiator if there is air inside the system.Step 5: Turn the climate control heat to maxHeat Cabin 1 E1578916665204After you have started your engine, you should now turn the climate control heat to MAX. It depends on the car, but many cars use a valve that will restrict the coolant from flowing inside the car?s thermal pack if the climate control is set to cold.Other cars redirect the airflow and not the coolant flow, so this step will not make a difference with these cars. No matter which model you have, it?s an easy step to put your climate control to the MAX heat.Step 6: Rev the engine to 3000-4000 rpmPut your friend into the car and let him rev up your engine to around 3000-4000 RPM. This could cause the coolant to flow out of the radiator if you do not use the spill tool. Keep the RPMs steady while you are working in the system. Make sure that the coolant is not getting too hot while you work on it, though.Step 7: Open Bleed Valves CarefullyCoolant Bleed Valve E1611338814623While your friend is revving the engine slightly, you can now loosen the air bleeding valves. Ensure the coolant temperature is not too high as it will be dangerous to work with your car then. Be attentive to any coolant temperature peaks and coolant leaks at this point. Open the bleed valves carefully until it comes to water from them and then close them. Do this a couple of times until it only comes coolant from them when you open them.Step 8: Refill coolant if necessaryFill CoolantClose your air bleeding valves. Let your engine idle again and recheck and refill the coolant level and lower the front of your car. At this point, you should repeat these steps until you get heat inside the car and your coolant temperature reaches 90C and stays there. Put your radiator cap back. If your coolant temperature is now at 90C (work temperature) and you have heat inside your car, the air should now be gone from your vehicle. Warning: Hot coolant can harm you if it?s not used with care.Step 9: Go for a test driveDrive CarYou should now make sure that you can?t find any leaks after your repair. If it seems good, take your car out for a long test drive. Be very attentive about your coolant temperature during the test drive, and make sure the car does not start to overheat. Overheating can cause your head gasket to blow, and you really do not want that to happen. Check all the functions and the temperature of the climate control.Step 10: Fill coolant againRefill Coolant E1611338886692If your test drive went well without any temperature peaks or other strange behaviors, open your hood and recheck your coolant level. Check for any coolant leaks.After this, you can let your vehicle stand for a couple of hours, then take another test drive, do the same procedure and check for leaks and the coolant level.After all these steps, your repair should now be successful. If there are any strange behaviors, repeat this guide or continue your troubleshooting."
How to Add Antifreeze To my Car Safely ?	"Find out how to add antifreeze to your car. This guide has everything you need to know about the steps and products needed for proper care of your carAdd Antifreeze To CarYour vehicle uses many different types of fluid to run properly. One of the critical fluids to pay attention to is the antifreeze. If you don?t know how to add antifreeze to your vehicle or how often it should be done, this article is for you.We cover the basics of antifreeze, including some safety guidelines you should always follow. Plus, we outline the steps to add more antifreeze to your car. "
what are the Antifreeze Safety Precautions ?	"When you work with antifreeze, there are some safety precautions you should always follow. Here are a few to consider.Maintain your vehicle while parked on a flat, even surface. Use the parking brake to keep the vehicle from rolling during service. Wheel chocks can also help to keep it stable.Add coolant with the engine turned off. The engine should be completely cool before you open the reservoir cap. If the engine is warm to the touch, it?s best to wait longer. Never wear loose clothing while servicing your vehicle. If you have loose sleeves, roll them up before getting under the hood. Wear protective equipment. It?s best to have safety glasses and gloves on. You may also choose to wear dirty clothes or an apron to protect against coolant stains.Never ingest antifreeze. It is extremely toxic. If you accidentally ingest coolant, you must call 911.Keep antifreeze away from children and animals. Store the coolant in a safe location. It?s not difficult to service your own vehicle, but you always want to do so safely."
How to Add Coolant to my Vehicle ?	"To add antifreeze to your car, you must first gather all of your supplies, cool off the engine, and locate the coolant reservoir. Once you check the antifreeze levels, you can take off the cap and fill it appropriately. Plus, you want to inspect the system to ensure there are no leaks or problems. Here is a more detailed list of how to add antifreeze to your vehicle:1. Gather EquipmentYour vehicle requires a 50/50 combination of water and antifreeze, but some store-bought formulas are already mixed. Make sure you read the label carefully. It?s also important that you opt for the appropriate color based on what the manufacturer specifies. You can find antifreeze that?s colored blue, green, red, pink, yellow or orange. You can often find the manufacturer specs you need in the owner?s manual.Aside from choosing the right coolant, you also want to have all of your supplies and tools handy for an easier job. After all, it only becomes more complicated if you need to walk away while filling the antifreeze to gather more supplies. 2. Cool Car EngineIt?s important to turn off the car engine and give it time to cool down. Antifreeze shouldn?t be added while the engine is hot. Most importantly, you don?t want to get burned by touching a hot engine. Plus, the reservoir cap can be hot, holding back liquid that reaches boiling temperatures.Another reason to wait is because any sudden temperature change can lead to cracks in the engine. If you rapidly change the temperature from hot to cold, you could face hefty engine repair bills. Even if the engine has overheated and you need to add more antifreeze, it?s best to wait until the motor is cooler. Give it at least 15 minutes before you attempt to open the coolant cap. 3. Find Engine Coolant ReservoirCoolant ReservoirIt?s not hard to find the coolant reservoir. Most brands use a colored cap to make it easier. Not only might it be painted yellow, but it should also have a warning on it, telling you not to open it while the engine is hot.If you can?t find the plastic cap, look in your owner?s manual. This booklet outlines where the vital parts are located, including the coolant cap. 4. Check Antifreeze LevelsYou should be able to check the antifreeze level without taking the cap off. If you look at the reservoir, you will see the minimum and maximum lines printed on it. With the bright-colored coolant inside the translucent container, it?s easy to gauge. The coolant level must be between these two markers. The levels will change depending on whether the engine is hot or cold, but keeping it between these lines ensures proper operation at all times. 5. Take Off CapIf you need to top off the system, you have no choice but to remove the reservoir cap. It should screw off, but you should use caution.Any damage to the cap can lead to cooling system issues. Use caution, so it doesn?t become damaged in the process. 6. Add the AntifreezeIf the antifreeze needs to be diluted, now is the time to do so. Once you have the appropriate mixture, it?s time to add some into the system.With the use of a funnel, you can pour the appropriate amount of antifreeze into the reservoir. Once it reaches between the two indicator lines, you will stop pouring. 7. Check SystemFasten the cap back in place and run the car engine. You want to perform a quick inspection of the cooling system, looking for any leaks or issues.If you notice a leak, you must deal with the problem promptly or the engine could overheat. Otherwise, you are ready to hit the road. If the coolant system was almost empty before, you may need to bleed the cooling system."
what are Antifreeze?	"Antifreeze is a type of engine coolant that is responsible for regulating motor temperatures. In warmer weather, the antifreeze keeps the water in the cooling system from boiling over. It works with liquids that reach more than 275 degrees Fahrenheit. On the other hand, when temperatures get lower, the antifreeze keeps liquids from freezing. Antifreeze is also needed to lubricate various components, such as the water pump. If there isn?t lubrication, permanent damage can occur. Finally, antifreeze helps to reduce corrosion.Antifreeze is made from propylene glycol or ethylene glycol. It may also contain special additives to prevent corrosion and oxidation, but these additives will generally make up fewer than 10% of the mixture. "
How Often Should Antifreeze be Added?	"You need to put more antifreeze in the system any time the levels get too low. Generally, this shouldn?t occur unless there is a leak. It?s also important that you have the coolant changed after 60,000 miles. Once the first service is performed, you might choose to have it replaced every 30,000 miles. However, you want to follow whatever guidelines the automaker sets out in the maintenance schedule, as some recommend different terms. "
what the Types of Antifreeze ?	"IAT coolant is one of the most commonly used. The Inorganic Additive Technology has been around for several decades and it provides superior corrosion protection. You might know this type as ZEREX Original Green, which is a popular brand.Another common formula is Dex-Cool, mainly used in GM vehicles. However, older vehicles require special additives, such as AlugardPlus. You can find this in a Multi-Vehicle Antifreeze formula. Reference the owner?s manual to find out what type of antifreeze is required for your vehicle. "
differencesbetween Antifreeze and Coolant ?	"Many people use the terms coolant and antifreeze interchangeably, but they are not the same. Coolant is the mixture between water and antifreeze. It?s what?s needed to fill the cooling system. Antifreeze is made from propylene glycol or ethylene glycol, but it must be diluted to work correctly.You can find antifreeze that needs to be diluted on the store shelves. You can also find coolant that has already been mixed. "
What if Coolant Levels Drop Without a Leak?	"If you notice that the antifreeze level has dropped too low, but there?s no leak, you could have some serious problems on your hands. In most cases, this situation means that the coolant is leaking internally into areas where it doesn?t belong.Some possible causes are a damaged cylinder head, a manifold leak, malfunctioning cylinder bores or a blown head gasket. With any of these problems, you are looking at extensive repairs to save the engine."
What Causes A Low Coolant Level?	"The most common reason for a low coolant level is a leaking cooling system. The leaks can come from leaking hoses, sensors, or gaskets. Just topping up the coolant level should never be a long-term solution.You will find more possible symptoms further down in the article, but first, let?s take a look at the consequences of driving with a low engine coolant level."
what the Consequences of Driving With Low Engine Coolant Level ?	"The most common consequence of driving with a low engine coolant is air in the cooling system, resulting in an overheating engine. An overheating engine can lead to a blown head gasket or a damaged engine block.Here is a more detailed list of what can happen if you ignore & drive around with a low engine coolant level:1. Air in the coolant systemThe first thing that could happen if you drive around with low coolant is that the water pump will pump air into the coolant system, which will cause airlocks in the coolant system.Airlocks will cause the cooling system?s flow to be disturbed, which will cause an overheating engine.2. Overheating EngineBecause of the airlocks in the coolant system that we talked about before, the water pump will not pump around the coolant to keep the engine at a good temperature, and this will cause the engine to overheat.An overheating engine can cause many expensive issues with your engine, which we discuss in the next sections.3. Blowing the head gasketA very common thing that can happen when your engine overheats due to low engine coolant is a blown head gasket.The head gasket is located between the engine head and the cylinder head; its purpose is to separate compression, oil, and coolant. Replacing the head gasket is often quite expensive, and you can expect repair costs of over $1000; however, it is nothing compared to what comes next.4. Damaged Engine blockAn even more serious issue that can occur if you drive with a low engine coolant is a damaged or cracked engine block. As we told you before, low engine coolant can create hotspots in the cooling system.These hotspots can cause extreme temperatures in the engine block, which can actually cause it to crack, and a crack in the engine block or cylinder head is the last thing you want. To repair it, you have to replace the whole engine block.5. Seized EngineMost engine parts are made of metal, and as you may already know, metal expands and shrinks depending on the temperature. If the engine gets too hot, engine parts can expand so much that damage will occur, and the engine will seize.Usually, the only way to fix a seized engine is to tear the whole engine apart to locate the issue."
Is it safe to drive with a low engine coolant level?	No. It is not safe to drive with a low engine coolant level. Low engine coolant can cause airlocks in the coolant system and an overheating engine can destroy expensive parts like the engine block or seize it completely.Refilling the engine coolant is such an easy thing to do and surely worth considering the consequences of it. Just be careful never to open the coolant reservoir when the engine coolant is hot!
what i9s the Symptoms of Low Engine Coolant ?	"The most common symptom of low engine coolant is a coolant level warning symbol on the dashboard. If your temperature gauge is fluctuating it could be caused by a low engine coolant level.The easiest way to see if the engine coolant level is low is, of course, to open the hood and check in the coolant reservoir.There are, however, some other things you can check for. Here is a more detailed list of the most common symptoms of low engine coolant:1. Low engine coolant symbol on the dashboardMost modern cars have a warning light that will appear on the dashboard if the engine coolant is low. It may sound obvious, but not all car models have this light, especially if the car model is a little bit older.If the low engine coolant system warning light appears on the dashboard, it is definitely time to check the coolant level.2. Fluctuating temperature gaugeAnother low engine coolant symptom you will notice is that the engine temperature gauge may start to fluctuate fast between different temperatures.This happens when the engine coolant is so low that air is pumped around in the coolant system. When an airlock surrounds the coolant sensor, it will drop, and when the coolant comes again, it will go back to the normal temperature.3. Rising temperature gaugeWhen the engine is being cooled normally, the dashboard?s temperature gauge will be below the halfway mark. If it moves up over the engine?s working temperature, there is a problem that needs to be fixed fast.If your temperature gauge is going over the normal working temperature (200 Fahrenheit or 90 degrees Celcius), you need to shut off the engine so as to avoid overheating.4. Heater is not workingThe car?s heater uses the same coolant that runs through the engine. Valves are used to control the car?s coolant inflow, thereby regulating the temperature.If your heater is not working as expected, you could be suffering from low engine coolant because of airlocks in the heater core.5. The sweet smell of anti-freezeAnti-freeze is a compound included with the coolant to prevent the radiator?s water from solidifying during cold seasons.One distinguishing characteristic of the anti-freeze is that it has a sweet smell. If you notice that your engine is producing a sweet smell, then the cooling system is leaking."
what the Causes of Low Engine Coolant Level ?	"The most common cause of low engine coolant level is an external coolant leak, but it can also disappear from other places.Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of a low engine coolant level:1. External coolant leakAs I mentioned above, the most common cause of low engine coolant levels is external leaks. External coolant leaks can come from any part of the coolant system. Luckily, external coolant leaks are often visible, and you can easily determine where the leak is coming from.Common places external leaks come from include the water pump, radiator, or around the thermostat.2. Faulty intake manifold gasketMany intake manifolds cool the intake air with coolant, and they, therefore, have coolant channels inside them. There is a gasket installed between the intake manifold and the cylinder head.This gasket can start to leak, and if it does, it will cause the engine to suck in and combust the coolant. You can often recognize this by seeing white smoke from the exhaust pipe.3. Faulty head gasketAnother thing that can cause low engine coolant is a bad or blown head gasket. As I mentioned above, the head gasket separates the compression, oil, and coolant.Therefore, a faulty head gasket can cause the coolant to mix with the compression, and it will cause the engine to combust the engine coolant. This is easiest recognized by looking for white smoke from the exhaust pipe.4. Faulty radiator capInside the radiator cap, you will find an overpressure valve that opens if the pressure rises above a specific pressure. If this valve is faulty, it might open before that pressure is reached, and if it does, coolant will leak out.You can often see this by looking for white smoke coming from the engine bay.5. Faulty EGR coolerThe last thing on this list that can cause low engine coolant is a crack inside the EGR cooler. Not all car engines have EGR coolers, so you must research if your engine has one first. They are mostly found in European cars.A faulty EGR cooler will cause the coolant to leak into the exhaust pipe, which will also cause white smoke from the exhaust pipe."
what are Coolant?	"Coolant is antifreeze that has been mixed with water to protect the vehicle. Coolant keeps the engine at a safe operating temperature while also ensuring that it doesn?t freeze. To make most coolants, you mix the antifreeze mixture with equal parts of water. While water will cool the engine by itself, it isn?t as effective. In fact, water can evaporate when the engine becomes too hot and it can freeze in colder climates. Both of these conditions leave your engine vulnerable to damage. The color of the coolant is from the dyes used to make it. Manufacturers add a particular dye to the composition to ensure you know which one to use. Two of the most known coolant colors are green and orange. "
Differences Between Green and Orange Coolant ?	"The main difference between green and orange antifreeze is the ingredients. Green coolant uses inorganic additive technology while orange uses organic acid technology. Orange is better suited for newer cars with an aluminum block, while green is better for older cars.Here are some more details of the differences between these coolants:1. Green CoolantGreen CoolantThis engine coolant was made specifically for older vehicles, dating before 2000. Green coolant is used in systems designed with copper and steel. The green composition protects the metallic parts from corrosion and rust. Within the composition, Inorganic Additive Technology (IAT) is added into the mixture. IAT contains several compounds, such as silicone and phosphate mixed with ethylene glycol and propylene glycol. The phosphates come from phosphoric acid and are used to remove grease and oil, along with softening water. Silicones are used as the metal sealant, keeping the materials from damage caused by wear, chemicals and moisture. Ethylene or propylene glycol is used to keep engine temperatures at bay. 2. Orange CoolantOrange CoolantOrange antifreeze also helps to protect against corrosion and wear, but it?s not meant for vehicles made with a lot of metal. Instead, it is used on newer models that are made from nylon and aluminum. Inside the orange coolant are carboxylates, which work to reduce corrosion. However, these substances don?t hurt the non-metallic parts, like the green coolant can. Systems started to be built with less steel copper in the 1990s. That?s when GM released DexCool, which mixes Organic Acid Technologies (OAT) to reduce the instance of rust. However, orange coolant does allow oxygen into the system when it gets too low. This fault leads to damage of the internal components and clogs. That?s why it?s important to keep the system filled up at all times. "
Is it Okay to Mix Coolant Types?	"You should never mix orange and green coolant together. When the two combine, a chemical reaction occurs, leading to thickening that shouldn?t take place. What you are left with is a gel substance that doesn?t operate the same way liquid does.This gel won?t be able to cycle through the system properly, leading to a multitude of problems. When the system can?t be cooled properly, it will overheat, leading to catastrophic failure. As one example, consider the cost of replacing the water pump in your vehicle. On average, you can spend $450 to $700 having the water pump replaced, with parts costing $250 to $300 and the labor adding another $200 to $400. "
How Often Should Coolant Be Flushed?	"It?s important to keep the cooling system running its best to ensure a long engine life. Topping off the coolant when levels get low is one step to maintaining the system. However, there are times when a coolant flush is necessary. There is no set timeframe designated for a coolant flush across the board. However, you will find the recommended interval for your vehicle in the owner?s manual. Additionally, the dealership can give you a printout of the maintenance schedule, including the best time for coolant flush service. Newer coolant formulas are made to last longer, allowing them to work up to 100,000 miles or five years, whichever is first. You might also prefer to test the integrity of the coolant with a set of test strips from your local auto parts store. By simply dipping one into the coolant reservoir, you can determine if the pH has risen too higher, thereby requiring a flush. During a coolant flush, all of the old fluid is removed and a cleaner is put into the system to remove any dangerous contaminants. Once this cleaner is flushed out, new fluid is added, with a ratio of 50/50 water and antifreeze."
what are the Symptoms of Bad or Blown Head Gasket ?	"The main symptoms of a bad or blown head gasket include:Overheating cooling systemOil contaminationBad Engine PerformanceExternal leaksWhite smoke from exhaustHere is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or blown head gasket to look for:1. Overheating Cooling SystemEngine OverheatingWhile the defective head gasket might have originally been caused by the engine overheating, it can also cause further temperature issues. If you?ve recently run the coolant too low, had a clogged radiator, or found a cooling system leak and ran the engine too hot, you might have damaged the head gasket.Now, oil might be infiltrating the cooling system or the coolant is leaking into the cylinders where it is burned off. Either way, you are dealing with an engine that won?t stop overheating. You should never drive a car when the engine overheats, as it can lead to cylinder head warping and damage to the catalytic converter. Both of these problems are only going to add further expense to your car repair bills. 2. Oil ContaminationCheck Engine Oil LevelHead gasket failure often leads to a milky, sludge-like substance on the oil filler cap or dipstick. It resembles a milkshake and occurs because coolant leaked into the oil or vice versa. While this could mean other issues besides a blown head gasket, it?s a pretty good sign that your engine needs to be ripped apart. You don?t ever want to drive with oil contamination occurring because it will ruin the engine bearings. Repair often requires a complete oil flush, replacing the oil filter, and removing the engine?s bottom to check on the bearings. 3. Bad Engine PerformanceCheck Engine Light On Dashboard E1609869927250When the head gasket fails, it can allow compressed air and fuel to escape over to another cylinder. This problem reduces the compression in the cylinder, leading to a rough-running motor. As you are heading down the road, you might notice a significant loss of power as a result. This symptom might also occur with a strange sound, something that sounds like an exhaust leak. Another thing that can happen is that the coolant is leaking into the combustion chamber, which will cause the car to misfire and have rough idle and acceleration.If this happens, you will most likely also notice a check engine light on your dashboard, telling you which cylinder the misfire occurred when you read the trouble code.4. External LeaksCoolant Leaking E1609789888621While we are discussing leaks, the head gasket failure can lead to similar external issues. The gasket fails and allows oil or water to leak not only into the engine or cooling system but also outside too. This doesn?t just cause further issues, but it?s messy as well. Additionally, if the coolant levels fall too low because of the leak, it can cause the engine to overheat, leading to permanent damage. 5. White SmokeWhite Smoke From ExhaustIf there is an oil leak from the bad head gasket, you could end up with a blue smoke issue. The oil can land on the exhaust, causing smoke that is white or blue. However, an antifreeze leak creates a pure white smoke with a sweet smell. The antifreeze is making its way past the head gasket and infiltrates the cylinders. As part of the combustion that?s occurring, the coolant turns into white smoke coming from the exhaust pipe.Both of these leaks allow pressure to enter the cooling system or oil breather system. If you are struggling to keep the dipstick secure or one or more of the radiator hoses continue to blow, this could be the cause. Additionally, you must be aware of the fire hazard involved with leaking oil. As it lands on the hot exhaust, it could create acrid smoke, plus the risk of fire. "
what are The Function of a Head Gasket ?	"The head gasket is responsible for sealing the engine?s combustion process in the chamber. It allows the coolant and oil to flow properly through the system without mixing. This seal allows the combustion process to occur uninterrupted to produce the power needed for propulsion, while harmful gases are directed out through the exhaust as directed.Modern head gaskets are constructed from layers of steel material combined with elastomer. This design is durable and lasts longer. Older head gaskets were made from asbestos and graphite. Because of the better construction, newer gaskets are less prone to failure than the older models. "
Head Gasket Location ?	"The head gasket is located between the engine block and the cylinder head. To find it, you must remove the cylinder head together with other engine parts.The most difficult aspect of replacing a head gasket is finding it. This vital component is located deep in the framework of the engine.You might be able to find more detailed instructions in a service manual. Either way, if you decide to replace the head gasket yourself, you want to carefully remove each part and put them in a secure location. "
what are the Head Gasket Replacement Cost ?	"The average head gasket replacement cost is between $1250 and $2300, depending on the car model and labor costs. A head gasket costs $250 to $300 while the labor costs $1,000 to $2,000.Head gasket repairs are among the least favorites of many car owners, mainly because of the price. That?s why many cars with a bad head gasket get sent to the junkyard, especially when the resale value is already low.Typically, the head gasket replacement is expensive, but not because of the parts. Instead, the high cost comes from how much work is required to replace the head gasket.The entire engine head has to be removed to access the head gasket, which is a time-consuming job. Because your mechanic needs to give up other jobs during those hours, you will be charged for every minute they spend working on the head gasket.If you are a trained mechanic, you can reduce costs if you do the repairs yourself. However, you will need a lot of time to get the job done and some special equipment. Otherwise, you can reduce the costs by getting the head gasket repaired early. At the first sign of trouble, get your car to the shop. If you don?t, you could create more engine damage that will only rack up the cost and cause lengthier repairs. "
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Radiator Cap ?	"The most common symptom of a bad radiator cap is coolant leaks under the radiator. You may also notice dried white streaks on the radiator coming from the cap. If your coolant is low, it?s can be a sign that the radiator cap is bad.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing radiator cap to look for:1. Leaking CoolantCoolant Leaking E1609789888621The most obvious sign that something bad is going on is coolant pooling underneath your vehicle. Your vehicle?s cooling system is a sealed system, which means everything that goes in is supposed to stay in.If your vehicle has a coolant leak, you need to investigate further, and the problem might come down to your radiator cap.2. White Streak on RadiatorRadiator LeakJust because coolant is leaking from your radiator cap doesn?t mean it?s making it to the ground. The radiator cap is at the radiator?s top, and if the leak isn?t bad enough, the coolant might burn off the radiator before it starts to drip off the bottom.If that happens, there will be white streaks left on the radiator where the coolant burned off.3. Low CoolantLow Coolant LevelYour vehicle has a sealed cooling system, so if you had enough coolant one day, you should have enough the next. If you find that you keep adding coolant, that means your engine is either burning or leaking coolant.It?s going somewhere! If you consistently have low coolant take a look at your radiator cap to see if that?s where it?s escaping from.4. Overflowing ReservoirOverflow ReservoirOnce the coolant reaches a specific temperature, it generates enough pressure to open up the radiator cap pressure valve, which sends the coolant back to the reservoir. But if the radiator cap isn?t working correctly, it can send too much fluid back to the reservoir, sending coolant out of the overflow hose.5. Overheating EngineEngine OverheatingYour radiator cap does a few different things to keep your engine at the correct temperature. While we?ll get more into how it works later in the article, just know that a bad radiator cap can lead to an overheating engine!6. Steaming Engine/Radiator CapWhite Smoke Radiator E1609789853150When everything is working correctly, the radiator cap does a great job at pressuring the system to raise the coolant?s boiling point. But if you have a faulty radiator cap, the coolant won?t reach the right temperature, and it can start to boil.The result will be a lot of steam coming from your engine or your radiator cap as the coolant boils out of the system."
what are the The function of the Radiator Cap ?	"The radiator cap might be the most overlooked component in your vehicle?s cooling system, but it might be the most impressive. There are four functions of the radiator cap, and if any one of them isn?t working correctly, you?ll run into problems. Those functions are:To pressurize the cooling systemRelives excess pressure to the reservoirSeals the cooling systemDirects coolant to the radiator through a vacuum valveFor starters, your radiator cap pressurizes the system. This pressure raises the boiling point of the coolant. It?s why if coolant is leaking out of the radiator cap, it might burn off on the engine, but it won?t burn off inside the system. Without a pressurized system, the coolant will start to boil, and your engine won?t be able to cool down effectively.Second, while some pressure is good, too much is detrimental. Excess pressure can blow up hoses, the cap itself, and any other weak points in the system. The radiator cap has a set point where it opens up to send the excess pressure to the reservoir, which has an open excess coolant hose to relieve the pressure safely.Third, the radiator cap seals the system. It?s pretty straightforward; when you take the cap off, you can add coolant directly to the radiator, but you can?t have an opening with the engine running, or else you?ll introduce air to the system, which is detrimental.Finally, when the coolant starts to cool down, it contracts, which lowers the coolant level in the radiator. The radiator cap?s vacuum valve sends more coolant to the radiator to keep everything at the right level."
Radiator Cap Location ?	"While many people overlook the radiator cap, it?s typically easy to find. First, you need to locate the radiator, which is usually in the front of the engine bay.The radiator cap is located on the top of the radiator, typically on the left or right side, but sometimes right in the middle of the radiatorOnce you?ve located the radiator cap, you?ll need to press down on it and twist it to take it off. It?s essential to never take the radiator cap off of a hot engine! The system is pressurized, so as soon as you take off the cap, all that pressure has somewhere to escape.Not only will you lose a ton of coolant as it shoots out of the radiator cap opening, but it?s also going to be scalding hot."
what are the cost of the  Radiator Cap Replacement  ?	"The average radiator cap replacement cost is between $10 and $50, depending on the car model. A new radiator cap costs from $5 to $25, while labor only takes 10 seconds to replace and is often free.The good news is that if you have a faulty radiator cap, it?s one of the cheapest possible components to replace.Even better is that it?s extremely easy to replace. Labor costs can vary depending on if the mechanic you take it to has a set minimum rate for all jobs ? but we highly recommend just replacing it yourself because it?s so easy.All you need to do is locate the radiator cap and push down and twist it counterclockwise to take it off. Just be sure that the engine is completely cool before doing this! You need to let your vehicle sit for at least 12-hours before removing the radiator cap.From there, all you need to do is twist the new radiator cap on clockwise to finish the job! It?s easy to do, and it can save you a few bucks at the repair shop."
Is It Safe to Use Regular Water Instead of Coolant?	"Most people do not drive around with extra coolant in the car. So what if you need to fill it, but only have access to water? Let's find out!Can You Use Water Instead Of CoolantHave you ever put water into the coolant tank of your vehicle instead of using antifreeze? You wouldn?t be the first person to do so. Many people believe it is okay to add distilled water instead of coolant, especially if you live in a hot climate. After all, why do you need a fluid to stop freezing if it never gets below 32-degrees Fahrenheit? So, is it safe to use water instead of coolant?Sure, water is cheaper and might prevent overheating, but this isn?t all that coolant is good for. It?s needed for proper cooling system function. Let?s take a closer look. "
Can I Use Water Instead of Coolant?	"You can use water instead of coolant in emergency situations when you only have access to water. It is recommended to fill the system with the correct coolant mix immediately after repairing the leak. However, never drive with only water in the long run.It is definitely not recommended to use only water for long-term use, even if you live in a warm climate. It can cause internal rust, overheating, and other issues with your engine if you only use water."
Differences between Coolant and Water ?	"1. Boiling PointFew people think about the boiling point differences between water and coolant. However, it?s clear that the operating temperature of your vehicle is going to be hotter than the boiling point of water (212øF). When you mix ethylene glycol antifreeze in a 50/50 ratio, the boiling point rises to 223øF. That figure is much closer to the engine?s operating temperature. Using waterless coolant changes the boiling point to 375øF or more. Without antifreeze, the vehicle?s engine is going to overheat. The liquid inside will boil over and evaporate, forcing you to stop your vehicle so the motor can cool off. You can also cause serious damage to the engine by letting it overheat. 2. Freezing PointThe opposite can be said if you live in a cooler climate. Without antifreeze in the cooling system, it will freeze. When your radiator freezes, you have big problems on your hands. In fact, the radiator could crack, rendering your cooling system useless. 3. Corrosion ProtectionOver time, the minerals in water are going to create deposits in the radiator that can cause it to stop working correctly. Water is also corrosive to metal, so rust is going to form faster. Both of these conditions are dangerous to your car engine, which is why coolant has special additives to stop rust formation.When you mix antifreeze, you should always use distilled water because there are no impurities in it. With the right mixture, the metal components are properly protected, ensuring a long life. "
what are Coolant/Antifreeze?	"The terms ?coolant? and ?antifreeze? tend to be used interchangeably, even though they are slightly different. Antifreeze is made from ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, ensuring that the coolant remains in liquid form for maximum protection. Antifreeze is mixed with distilled water in a 50/50 ratio, making it a coolant. Antifreeze is available in a variety of colors, either green, pink, yellow, red, blue or orange. These colors make it easier to identify the right type of antifreeze for your vehicle. "
How Does Coolant Work?	"As you drive your vehicle, the engine creates a lot of heat and needs to be continuously cooled to work right. If the engine weren?t cooled down, it would lead to complete motor failure.The cooling system directs coolant flow into the passages of the engine block, as well as the cylinder heads. While the coolant passes through the engine, it absorbs the heat.Heated fluid moves from the engine to the radiator. As it goes through the radiator?s thin tubes, it gets cooled off because of the air coming through the front of the vehicle. There?s also a fan blowing on the radiator to cool it off. Cooled fluid moves back out of the radiator to the engine once again. This circulation of coolant is what runs the cooling system. "
Why is Coolant Important?	"When the heat created by an internal combustion engine builds up, it can cause numerous problems that are expensive to repair. Not only can the head gasket blow, but the cylinder head can warp, and severe engine damage follows.By using water in the motor, the liquid evaporates and boils away, leaving the vehicle without fluid. On the other hand, in cold climates, there?s a higher risk that the water will freeze, which leads to cracks in the radiator, a cracked engine block, or failure of the heater core. Each automaker has a different configuration to the cooling system, requiring a particular coolant for complete protection. You don?t want to use an antifreeze other than the one that is recommended, or you could do more harm than good. "
what are the Right Way to Add Coolant ?	"Before you get started, you want to check the coolant levels. Don?t open the radiator cap while the engine is hot, because pressure has built up inside, leading to spraying hot liquid when the cap is removed. Once the engine is cool, open the coolant reservoir cap. You can look inside or check the level by reading the markings on the side of the tank. If more coolant is needed, mix the antifreeze according to the directions, using distilled water. If you purchase a premixed coolant, you can skip this step.Pour the coolant into the overflow tank, but don?t fill it all the way. This fluid expands when it gets hot. If your vehicle doesn?t have an overflow tank, you can pour it right into the radiator, but don?t surpass the ?full? marking. Put the cap back on and start the engine. You should also inspect the radiator and hoses for leaks at this time. Taking care of your cooling system with the right fluid ensures your engine runs as it should."
Causes of Coolant Leak While Car is not  Running ?	"Coolant leaks when the car is not running can be caused by damaged hoses, a bad radiator cap, a bad radiator, or a defective water pump. It?s also possible that there is a bad heater core or a blown head gasket. A bad intake manifold gasket could also be to blame. Here is some more detailed information on what could cause a coolant leak when the car is running.1. Bad Heater CoreHot coolant gets pumped into the engine through the system?s heater core. The heat that is generated from the system gets blown into the vehicle through the HVAC vents when you activate the heater.If the heater core is bad, you will notice trouble getting heat into the system. You might also see leakage under the vehicle, around the passenger or driver seat area. 2. Damaged HosesA broken hose can also cause a leak when the engine is running or not. As the motor runs, the pressure of the system can either increase the leak or decrease it, depending on where the hole is.Either way, hoses can become brittle and worn over time, which is why they should be regularly inspected. The heat and constant pressure can increase the wear if left unchecked. 3. Bad Radiator Cap or RadiatorThe radiator cap is needed to keep the coolant in the system where it belongs. It also helps to regulate the pressure in the radiator.If the cap is damaged, coolant can leak out, leading to lower levels in the radiator. Additionally, the coolant reservoir could overflow when you run the engine because of the higher pressure in the hoses.The radiator could also be cracked or damaged from any external damages like corrosion or stones when traveling at high speeds.  4. Blown Head GasketIf the coolant has started leaking into the engine oil or combustion chamber, a blown head gasket is the likely cause. The head gasket is responsible for keeping the oil and coolant separated from one another.As coolant leaks into the system, it?s no longer able to keep the engine cool. This problem occurs when the engine is running and when it?s off, but running the engine is more dangerous since the motor will start overheating. A bad head gasket can also cause external coolant leakage and you will see if coolant leaks out between the engine block and the head.5. Defective Water PumpIf the water pump becomes damaged, you might notice a huge coolant leak. The water pump?s job is to push the coolant through the hoses smoothly. As the water pump starts to fail, the coolant can no longer flow the way it should. This is yet another issue that can cause problems with the engine on and off. 6. Bad Intake Manifold GasketThe intake manifold gasket is found at the spot where the manifold connects to the engine. If coolant is leaking below the vehicle, it could be caused by a bad gasket.As with any of the issues, the sooner this is repaired, the better off you are. Otherwise, it could create large problems when the engine is running. "
what the Areas to Examine for Coolant Leak ?	"1. Radiator/CapThe first place to look for a leak is around the radiator. You might need to clean off the radiator of leaves, dirt and debris to see where the coolant is coming from. You should also examine the radiator cap to see if it is damaged. It should be securely attached to the radiator to avoid leakage and other consequences. 2. HosesThere are hoses throughout the system that should be examined. If there is a torn hose, the coolant should be dripping from its surface. Depending on where the hole is, the leak may only occur when the engine is running or off, based on where the coolant is at the time.You also want to look for cracks in the hose surface. Even if there isn?t a hole yet, coolant could easily be seeping through the crack. 3. Under VehicleGet underneath the vehicle and take a good look for leaking coolant. Depending on what kind you use, the liquid will be blue, red or green. By determining where the leak is coming from, you will have a better idea of what part might have failed. If you have driven with a coolant leak, it might have blown onto other parts. Wash down the undercarriage and inspect it again for a better idea of where the leak is coming from. 4. Heater CoreTake a peek at the floorboards under the passenger seat of your vehicle. If you notice coolant stains, the problem could be the heater core. When the heater core is damaged, it can leak fluid under the car on that side. It will also cause lower levels, which could lead to the engine overheating. 5. Under the water pumpWater pumps are mostly driven by the serpentine belt or timing belt depending on your car model. If it is driven by the serpentine belt, you can start looking for leaks under the pump.If the pump is driven by the timing belt, it may be more difficult to see it and you may need to remove the timing belt cover to get a glimpse of the pump. However, if there is a leak under the crankshaft pulley and the pump is driven by the cam belt, there is a great risk that it is the pump that is leaking.6. Head GasketIt?s not as easy to see a leaking head gasket. To discover this issue, you will need to check the coolant fluid and oil to see if there?s any contamination. You can also try to check between the engine block and head if you can see any external coolant leaks."
How to Fix Coolant Leak ?	"The fix for a coolant leak depends on what are causing the fault in the first place. For example, with a damaged heater core, a replacement is all that can be performed. It will often cost between $500 and $1,000 for the parts and labor to replace a heater core.Damaged hoses vary in cost, depending on where the hose is and how difficult it is to remove. However, there are times when a hose is leaking because of a loose clamp. If this is the case, you just need to tighten or replace the clamp.One of the cheapest options is to replace a bad radiator cap. You may spend just $10 to $50 for a new cap and the installation is simple.If the water pump has failed, you will need to replace it. A new water pump replacement could cost $350 to $800, but there?s the option to purchase a remanufactured water pump to save a little money. If you need to replace the intake manifold gasket, the part itself doesn?t cost a lot of money. In fact, it might only be $20 to $100. However, it?s not an easy part to replace, so the labor could easily add another $200 to $400 unless you can swap it out at home.The most expensive fix is to replace the head gasket. You could easily spend $1,500 to $2,000 on a new head gasket installation. However, if you don?t get the blown head gasket fixed promptly, there could be severe engine damage occurring as the motor continues to overheat. This is not a problem you want to leave unchecked."
Can I Drive With a Coolant Leak?	"Your car may seem to run fine despite the coolant leak, but you shouldn?t drive it. As the coolant leaks, the engine temperature won?t be properly regulated. If the engine overheats, it could cause permanent damage. Furthermore, a small leak can quickly become major, even while you are on the road. For example, a small hole in a hose can become a massive hole, dumping out all of the coolant while you are away from home. "
what are the Symptoms Of A Clogged or Bad Radiator ?	"The most common symptom of a bad or clogged radiator is an overheating engine. You may also notice a coolant leak under your car or a fluctuating temperature gauge on your dashboard.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or clogged radiator to look for:1. High Temperature Gauge ReadingsOverheating Engine E1609789863111If you?re watching your temperature gauge get precariously high, that?s a sign that something is not working as it should. If the engine gets too hot, it?ll just shut off, which means that the problem has progressed to something a little more serious.But an overheating engine can be a wide range of problems, including a faulty thermostat, a broken fan, or coolant leaks. You?ll need to do a little more troubleshooting to pinpoint the problem.2. Coolant LeaksCar LeakOne of the most common problems with a faulty radiator is a leak. While you?ll usually see leaks underneath your vehicle, that?s not guaranteed. Take a look around your radiator ? if you notice any white streaks or coolant puddles, then your radiator has a leak and needs repairs.3. Damaged Radiator FinsDamaged Radiator FinsAnother common problem with radiators is damaged fins. Radiators sit at the front of your vehicle, but the fins are one of the easiest components to damage. While a few smashed fins won?t make your engine overheat, the more smashed fins you have, the less coolant flow you have in your radiator.Additionally, smashed fins mean there?s a higher possibility that you have a leak.4. Fluid DiscolorationOne of the biggest radiator killers is corrosion. While corrosion shouldn?t be happening inside your cooling system, as the coolant wears down the likelihood of corrosion building up increases.Since the corrosion is on the inside of your radiator, you won?t be able to see it, but it will discolor the coolant. Try a coolant flush if it?s old coolant, but if it?s relatively new and already severely discolored, you have significant corrosion in your system.Try a radiator flush to see if you can free up enough of the passageways but be prepared as you might have to replace the radiator.5. Visible CorrosionVisible corrosion is often the first sign that you?re about to have a more significant problem. Corrosion leads to blown seals, worn down fins, and a litany of other potential issues. While a little corrosion isn?t a huge deal, you should get your radiator looked at by a certified mechanic if there is an excessive amount."
what The Function of the Radiator ?	"The radiator is a critical part of your cooling system. As your coolant passes through the engine, it heats up and given enough time and no cooling method, it will continue to heat up until your engine overheats and shuts off.Your radiator acts as an integral part of the system that cools your coolant. The coolant travels from one side of the radiator to the other through the small metal fins you see. By thinning out as it goes through the fins, it becomes easier to cool.Your vehicle does this with the help of an engine fan and by having air naturally flow over it as you drive. This is why the manufacturer puts your vehicle?s radiator at the front of your vehicle."
Radiator Location ?	"The radiator is one of the most straightforward components to find on your vehicle. It?s always located at the front of your vehicle ? that way, it can utilize airflow as you drive to aid in the cooling process.Typically, you?ll have your vehicle?s bumper/grill area, behind that you?ll have the fan, and behind that, you?ll have the radiator.The condenser and the radiator look remarkably similar, but they?re not hard to tell apart once you know what you?re looking at. You can tell your condenser apart from your radiator in two ways. First, the condenser is in front of the radiator. Second, the heater core is often much thinner than your radiator.When you?re locating your vehicle?s radiator, simply look for the larger of the two components and you?ll be in good shape. However, if you?re trying to gain access to your radiator you might run into problems, as it?s often tightly packed between other components."
how to make a Radiator Testing ?	"Testing a radiator is an important maintenance task for ensuring the proper functioning of your car's cooling system. Here are the steps to follow to test a car radiator:Turn off the engine of the car and let it cool down completely. This will prevent you from getting burned while performing the test.Open the hood of the car and locate the radiator. It is typically located at the front of the engine bay and will have a cap on the top.Remove the radiator cap and inspect the coolant level. If the coolant level is low, add more coolant until it reaches the recommended level.Start the engine of the car and let it run until it reaches normal operating temperature.Observe the temperature gauge on the dashboard to ensure that the engine does not overheat.With the engine running, check the coolant flow through the radiator. Look for signs of blockages, such as visible sediment, rust or debris, that could be causing a restriction in the flow of coolant.If the coolant flow seems slow or restricted, try flushing the radiator to remove any blockages. Consult your car owner's manual or a qualified mechanic for specific instructions on how to flush the radiator.If flushing the radiator doesn't improve the coolant flow, or if the radiator shows signs of physical damage like leaks or cracks, it may need to be replaced.Check the radiator fins to make sure they are not damaged or bent. Bent fins can restrict airflow through the radiator and cause overheating.If you suspect that the radiator is not functioning properly, you can also use a radiator pressure tester to check for leaks or other issues. The pressure tester will connect to the radiator cap and apply pressure to the system to help identify leaks or other issues.By following these steps, you should be able to test the radiator of your car and identify any issues that may be affecting the proper functioning of your car's cooling system. If you are unsure about any of the steps or if you do not feel comfortable working with automotive components, it is recommended that you take your car to a qualified mechanic for further diagnosis and repair."
what are the Radiator Replacement Cost ?	"The average radiator replacement cost is between $550 and $800, depending on the car model and labor costs. While this is an expensive cost, the good news is that a mechanic can repair many radiator problems.For instance, if one of the fins has a small leak, a certified repair shop can weld the leak shut, saving you a ton of money. Additionally, if the inside of your radiator is gunked up, a mechanic might be able to save it with a coolant flush for about $100.Just keep in mind that if the flush doesn?t work, you might be in the same predicament and have to replace your radiator.If you?re mechanically inclined and are trying to save a little money, you can replace your radiator yourself. While typically a little more involved, an aftermarket radiator typically costs between $100 and $200.When you add in the price of the new coolant that you?ll need ? you?ll likely spend around $250 to complete the repairs yourself. If you opt for an OEM replacement part, you can expect to spend a little more in parts compared to an aftermarket replacement."
How do I know if I have a bad radiator?	"If your car overheats, it could be due to a bad radiator. It?s also common for the radiator to start leaking, so if you see any coolant leaking under your car, it could be a sign that the radiator is bad. A fluctuating coolant temperature gauge could also be caused by a clogged radiator."
Does a bad radiator affect performance?	"The radiator does not affect a car?s performance per se. However, if your coolant temperature overheats, some modern car?s engine control module can limit the performance of the engine to prevent it from overheating, which can be fatal to an engine."
Is it safe to drive with a bad radiator?	"No, it is not safe to drive with a bad radiator, neither if it is clogged or leaking. If your car starts to overheat, it can blow the head gasket or cause even worse engine damage. So if your radiator is bad, it?s best to get it fixed as soon as possible."
How long does a radiator last?	"The car?s radiator is made to last the life of a car. However, you can expect it to last 8 to 10 years, but it all depends on the climate you live in and how you drive and maintain your car."
Reasons Why my Car Temperature Gauge Goes Up And Down ?	"The temperature gauge can fluctuate up and down because of a bad thermostat or a lack of coolant. It?s also possible that there is air in the cooling system. On the other hand, it could be due to a defective coolant temp sensor or a bad temperature gaugeHere is a more detailed list of the reasons why your car temperature gauge goes up and down:1. Bad ThermostatThermostat HousingThe thermostat is used to regulate the temperature of the coolant. If it starts to fail, it can act erratically, causing the gauge to jump up and down. Once it goes bad, it will no longer act this way.When the thermostat is stuck closed, the coolant isn?t able to flow, meaning the engine won?t be able to cool off. Because of this, the motor overheats.If the thermostat is stuck open, engine temperatures are going to drop below normal. You may also have trouble getting heat out of the HVAC system. 2. Low CoolantLow Engine CoolantIf there is too much water in the cooling system, the temperature gauge can act strangely. While some people mix water with the coolant, it?s important that too much doesn?t get into the system.Without enough coolant, the temperatures are going to increase. Because water can?t carry heat away from the engine as efficiently as coolant does, you could see unusual fluctuations in the temperature. If the engine starts to overheat, it?s best to replace the coolant. Follow the recommended mixture of antifreeze and water based on your car?s service requirements. 3. Air in Cooling SystemIf you are noticing the temperature gauge drop down at times, it could be due to air in the system. Air gets into the system through a defective radiator cap or blown head gasket. It can also infiltrate because of a leak in a radiator hose or improper procedures taken during a coolant flush.When the air pocket holds back the coolant, the engine will start to overheat. Once it starts moving again, the engine temperature can return back to normal. 4. Defective Temperature GaugeIt?s always possible that the temperature gauge itself is to blame. The instrument cluster isn?t the first thing to look at, but it always is a possibility if you can?t find anything else that?s wrong. Often, when the instrument cluster is having issues, you will see other problems. Take a look at the other gauges to see if there?s an electrical fault.5. Faulty Coolant Temperature SensorIt?s more likely that the faulty readings are coming from a malfunctioning coolant temperature sensor (CTS). This part is found in the engine, and it can become contaminated. If the sensor gets damaged or corroded, it could send the wrong signal. It can also cause erratic readings if it is working intermittently.  6. Bad Computer ModuleIf you are noticing that the temperature gauge is acting erratically, it could be due to a bad computer module. This part is needed to communicate data from the engine and other systems in the vehicle.It?s the module?s job to relay data that moves the temperature gauge. However, if the module is going bad, you may also notice other strange issues, as this part is used to control many different systems."
How to Fix Fluctuating Temperature Gauge ?	"1. Replace ThermostatOn average, you will spend $125 to $300 to replace the car thermostat. However, it?s not a difficult job to do yourself.Start by locating the thermostat. It is probably located where the top radiator hose joins the engine, but it could also be on the bottom hose. Remove the clamp and catch the coolant in a bucket underneath. Remove the old thermostat and put a new gasket in place. You can now put on the new thermostat, replace the parts, and fill the system back up with coolant. 2. Fill Cooling SystemA professional coolant flush will cost between $65 and $150 on average. However, this is another job that can be done at home. Drain the radiator and fill it back up with distilled water. Let the vehicle run for ten minutes. Shut off the engine and drain the dirty water from the system. Put fresh coolant into the system, mixed as recommended by your automaker.3. Bleed Cooling SystemYou can also bleed the cooling system if you notice air getting trapped. Take off the radiator cap and fill it with coolant as much as you can. Start the engine and turn the heat on high with the fan on low. Continue topping off the coolant as the levels drop. Loosen up the bleed valves and rev the engine a few times to circulate the coolant. Do this until the temperature stops fluctuating. 4. Replace Temperature Gauge Sensor or GaugeThe cost to replace the temperature gauge sensor should be between $200 and $450. You could need to change the coolant temperature sensor on the top or side of the engine. There?s also a chance that the gauges themselves are to blame.Make sure you perform proper diagnostics before you start replacing parts. Otherwise, you could waste money on unnecessary repairs. 5. Replace Computer ModuleThis is the most expensive repair of all the options. On average, a new Engine Control Module costs about $300 to $1,500 for parts and labor.A good code scanner should reveal if there?s an issue with the Engine Control Module. You may also notice other unusual symptoms as this central hub starts to fail."
How Does the Car Temperature Gauge Work?	"The car temperature gauge offers a look at the operating temperature of the engine. It?s normally located on the dashboard, near the speedometer. It?s designed to measure the coolant temperature, helping you see how hot or cold the motor is at any given time. The water pump helps to circulate coolant throughout the system. When it is in the engine, it gets heated up. It is then cooled back down when it gets to the radiator. The thermostat is required to maintain the appropriate temperature by stopping or starting the flow of coolant. There?s also a coolant temperature sensor found near the thermostat that sends the signal needed to create the gauge reading.You must know what the normal operating temperature is so you can determine if the needle position is good. When the engine is cold, the gauge will sit at the bottom of the range. In most cars, this reading is 122 degrees Fahrenheit. Once you begin driving, the engine starts to heat up. During this process, heat is transferred to the coolant to regulate the temperature. Once the engine is warmed up and everything is running normally, it will read between 180 and 220 degrees Fahrenheit. It should remain around these temperatures until you turn the vehicle off. At this point, the coolant stops flowing and the temperature drops back down. "
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Coolant Temperature Sensor ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad coolant temperature sensor include poor mileage, cooling fans not coming on, engine performance issues, an overheating engine, and a check engine light on your dashboard.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing coolant temperature sensor to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightOne of the first signs of all coolant temperature sensor symptoms you will probably notice is that the check engine light will show up on your dashboard.If the computer detects any problem with the sensor?s circuit, it will illuminate the check engine light, indicating that the car needs an inspection.If you see a check engine light on your dashboard, it is time to check the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner.2. Poor MileageBad Fuel ConsumptionA faulty ECT sensor can send a false signal to the onboard computer, resulting in an incorrect air-fuel mixture. For example, a faulty sensor can send a signal indicating the engine is cold when it is not, and more fuel will heat the engine quickly.This will cause the fuel economy to drop and decrease the engine?s performance.3. Electrical Cooling Fans not coming onCooling Fans Radiator CarSome cars use the engine coolant temperature sensor to control the electric cooling fans. In most cars, you have two separate temperature sensors for the fans, a dashboard gauge, and engine management.However, if your car has a single sensor, a bad engine coolant temperature sensor may result in your fans not starting.4. Black Smoke from the Exhaust PipeBlack Smoke CarDue to an incorrect engine temperature signal, the ECU may enrich the fuel mixture to a point where the combustion process becomes difficult.The excessive fuel will burn in the exhaust pipe and will produce thick black smoke.5. Hard Start ConditionStarting CarThe amount of fuel getting injected into the engine is critical at the moment you start your car. If the air-fuel mixture is faulty, you might find your car difficult or impossible to start.6. Engine OverheatsOverheating Engine On RoadThe cooling fan, which is behind the radiator grille, removes heat from the engine?s coolant. This fan is electrically controlled and relies on the signal from the onboard computer.If the fan receives a false signal, the fan might not turn on, causing the engine to overheat. Some vehicles have a separate coolant temperature sensor for the fan, but many cars use the same sensor.7. Poor IdlingCar Engine Rough IdleDue to a faulty ECT sensor, the fuel mixture will adjust. This will cause the engine to vibrate or shake when the car is at low speed and lead to other power losses and strange behaviors.The engine is very sensitive to wrong air-fuel mixtures at idle, and this is a condition when you might notice that something is wrong with your engine coolant temperature sensor.8. Poor Engine performanceSlow Car AccelerationThe engine coolant temperature sensor can have a hard impact on the air-fuel mixture. A bad air-fuel mixture can also cause the engine performance to drop drastically.If you feel that the engine performance is not what it has been before, it may be due to a faulty engine coolant temperature sensor."
what are an Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor?	"Coolant temperature sensors are also known as engine coolant temperature sensors or ECT sensors. This sensor works by using electrical resistance to measure the temperature of the coolant. These measurements produce essential data for the engine system of your vehicle.The readings produced from the coolant temperature sensor are transmitted to the engine control unit, where they are utilized as data for regulating and maintaining the proper ignition time and the optimal fuel injection through the computerized approach."
where the Coolant Temperature Sensor Location ?	"The engine coolant temperature sensor is usually located on the engine block or cylinder head. It is often installed on a plastic hose on the coolant?s inlet.Different brands and car manufacturers have different ways of placing the coolant temperature sensor depending on the car?s design.Some vehicles may have more than one temperature sensor, as sometimes, different sensors are used to signal to the dashboard, cooling fan control, and the control unit of your engine system.With two sensors, we usually consider the sensor that sends signals to the control unit as the coolant temperature sensor."
what are the Coolant Temperature Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"The average coolant temperature sensor replacement cost is between $50 and $250, depending on the car model and labor costs. A coolant temperature sensor costs $30 to $100, and the labor costs $20 to $150.The coolant temperature sensor itself is often quite cheap, and you can often find them for around $40 for a quality one. There are cheaper ones on the market, but I heavily recommend buying a quality one like Bosch to skip the headaches.The replacement is also often quite straightforward, except that you might have to pour out all the coolant from the engine and refill it. Unfortunately, removing the coolant also means that you have to remove all air from the coolant system, which can be difficult.However, if you are fast with replacing the sensor, there is often no need to tap out the coolant, but this requires some skill.Remember to always make sure the coolant temperature is low when doing this kind of work!!"
How to Diagnose a Faulty Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor?	"To diagnose the coolant temperature sensor, you need a repair manual for your car model to find what measurement values you should expect from the coolant temperature sensor.Connect an OBD2 Scanner and look for related trouble codes. Check the live data to see the temperature from the sensor. If it is way off the range, check the wirings, and replace the sensor.Locate the coolant temperature sensor in your vehicle by referring to the service manual.Find the coolant temperature sensor and remove the connector plugs.If you have two pins on the coolant temperature sensor, you can try measuring the ohm value between these two pins.Check your repair manual for the correct ohm value at a given temperature.If the value is wrong, replace the sensor.If it seems fine, check the wirings and connectors between the coolant temperature sensor and the engine control module."
How long does it take to replace a coolant temperature sensor?	"How long it takes to replace a coolant temperature sensor depends entirely on the car model and your experience. However, most coolant temperature sensors take about 30 to 60 minutes to replace."
Will the engine coolant temperature sensor keep a car from starting?	"Yes, a bad coolant temp sensor can prevent the engine from starting. For example, if it?s very cold outside, but the sensor tells the ECM that it?s warm, it won?t inject enough fuel to start the engine."
Do I have to drain the coolant to replace the temperature sensor?	"Yes, in most car models you need to drain the coolant to replace the temp sensor. In some car models, the sensor is located very high up on the engine and in these situations, you can sometimes switch the new sensor over quickly so you don?t have to empty the entire system. Only work on your car engine when the coolant is cold."
Is there a fuse for the coolant temperature sensor?	"No, you likely won?t find a fuse for the coolant temperature sensor itself. You can find a fuse for the engine control module though, which sends the signal to the coolant temperature sensor."
Conclusion	"If you?re experiencing any of these symptoms, take your car in for a checkup as soon as possible. A bad coolant temperature sensor can cause your vehicle to overheat. This can lead to serious engine damage, so it?s important to be aware of the symptoms and get it fixed as soon as possible if you suspect that the coolant temperature sensor is bad.The good news is that replacing a coolant temp sensor is relatively quick and easy on most car models, and won?t break the bank, so you don?t have to be a professional to do the job. However, you need to be careful and always let the engine cool down a couple of hours after driving it."
Can I Mix Different Types of Coolant?	"You should never mix different types or colors of coolant if you are not an expert on the chemical composition and reactions of the various types. Stay on the safe side and follow the manufacturer?s recommendations. Using the wrong type of coolant can lead to expensive repair costs.Now, I will take a closer look at why it?s not a good idea to mix different types of coolant."
what are the Different Types of Anti-Freeze ?	"While there are tons of different anti-freeze varieties out there, the two main types used for your vehicle are a traditional green anti-freeze and an orange anti-freeze that uses Dexcool. But while the color can be a great starting point to figure out what kind of coolant you have, sometimes the color can be misleading.For instance, not every vehicle that has orange anti-freeze has Dexcool. And if you add Dexcool into your regular orange anti-freeze, you?re asking for a problem. Always double-check and triple-check which kind of coolant is in your vehicle ? don?t just rely on the color.If you can?t find out for sure what kind of anti-freeze is in your vehicle, it?s best to complete a coolant flush so you know for sure what?s in there.Always check the specifications of what type of coolant your engine type requires!Green CoolantGreen coolant is by far the most common type of anti-freeze in vehicles. Green anti-freeze doesn?t last as long as orange coolant, but you should double-check your vehicle?s recommended service intervals before heading to flush out the coolant every few thousand miles.That?s because modern vehicles are getting better and better and sealing their cooling systems, which allows the fluid to last longer between changes. So, before you go flushing your system, take a peek in the owner?s guide and see what it says!Remember that these intervals are for the manufacturer-recommended anti-freeze, so if you?re using something else, you can expect that the service intervals will change as well.Orange CoolantFill CoolantOrange coolant is often a product named Dexcool. GM manufactured Dexcool and promised that you?d only need to flush your system every 150,000-miles if you used it. This is a much longer service life than regular anti-freeze, so you can see why its popularity surged.The only problem is that Dexcool didn?t always work as advertised. Moreover, just because you open the hood and see orange coolant, that doesn?t mean you have Dexcool. Always double-check what kind of coolant is in your vehicle instead of relying solely on the color.If you?ve never flushed the coolant on your vehicle, you can check the owner?s manual, if you have changed the coolant, you might be out of luck. If you don?t know, go ahead and flush the entire system before potentially mixing the wrong type of coolant.Less Common TypesFill CoolantWhile green and orange anti-freeze products are by far the most common, you can also find vehicles that use a pink, blue, or gold anti-freeze. This largely comes down to your vehicle?s manufacturer and what kind of coolant they decided to put in the vehicle.The differences between these coolants vary, but it almost always comes down to the types of additives used in each anti-freeze. They are all glycol-based, but the additives that they use make a big difference.If you can?t find the exact coolant that your vehicle uses, stop by the dealership or flush the entire system before adding the new coolant. Keep in mind that adding a different kind of coolant to a vehicle under warranty can void the warranty."
What Happens if I Mix Different Types of Anti-Freeze?	"Since there are so many different anti-freeze types, the exact results of mixing anti-freeze will vary depending on what anti-freezes you mix, but the short answer is that you should never mix different types of anti-freeze.For instance, if you mix green and orange anti-freeze, the two different types of additives will mix and coagulate. In short, they?ll get thick and gum up the system. Not only does this shorten the lifespan of the coolant, but it can cause your engine to overheat and damage your system.So, while there are some forums out there that claim you just need to go to the shorter lifespan of the two coolants ? this is 100 percent false, and it can severely damage your engine. Don?t risk it, and don?t mix different types of coolants.Keep in mind we?re talking about types of coolant here ? not brands. Most times, the brands simply switch the names but use the same formulas, so as long as they?re the same type, you?re still in great shape."
What if I?re in a Pinch?	"If you?re stuck out in the middle of nowhere and need to top off your coolant to get where you?re going, you have better options than mixing the wrong types of anti-freeze. While mixing the anti-freeze might get you where you?re going without any problems, you?re taking a risk.Instead, all you need to do is add some distilled water to top off your system. While diluting the system with more water lowers the boiling point and raises the freezing point, a system with only 10 percent anti-freeze and 90 percent water will still only have a freezing point of 26 degrees Fahrenheit.So, as long as you?re not driving during a snowstorm, you should be alright. If you read that and thought, ?I want the lowest possible freezing point, so I?m going to add 100 anti-freeze and no water,? you?re mistaken. Adding water actually lowers the freezing point and glycol ? to a point. The ideal anti-freeze to water ratio is 60 percent anti-freeze and 40 percent water.But if you?re in a pinch, add water ? not a different kind of anti-freeze. Not only will you avoid problems, but you?ll have no problem getting where you?re going either."
Final Thoughts On Mixing Anti-Freeze	"If you?re thinking about mixing anti-freeze to save a few bucks ? don?t. While you might save $20 to $40 now, it can easily cost you a couple hundred to a couple thousand dollars down the road.If you?re worried and trying to save a little money, just add distilled water to the system. Distilled water is not the same as tap water, as tap water has chemicals that can lead to corrosion inside your cooling system.But distilled water is cheap ? you can usually find it for as little as $1 per gallon. Don?t take the risk by mixing anti-freeze types, it?s just not worth it."
Why Is My Car Heater Blowing Cold Air?	"There is not much more horrible than driving a car in cold weather when the car heater is blowing cold air. Here're the most common reasons why this happens and how to fix itCar Heater Is Blowing Cold AirDriving during the winter season can be very unpleasant, especially if you do not have a working heater in your car.There is simply nothing like a nice heater to keep you warm and stuffy in your car.Unfortunately, problems with the heating system are quite common. In this article, we discuss the most common reasons why your car heater is blowing cold air."
why my Car Heater Is Blowing Cold Air ?	"The most common reasons why a car heater is blowing cold air are due to a low coolant level, a malfunctioning thermostat, broken heater flaps, or air in the cooling system. It can also be caused by a clogged heater core or faulty heater controls.Here is a more detailed list of the common causes of why the heater is blowing cold air:1. Low Coolant LevelLow Coolant LevelThe most common problem when the heat is not working in your car is actually a low coolant level.Luckily, the coolant level is very easy to check. Locate the coolant reservoir (Usually a red, green or blue fluid). In most car models, it also says coolant in the text on the cap of it. Check the service manual of your car if you are not sure about which reservoir to look for.You should also find a MAX and MIN sign on the reservoir. If the level is under the MIN sign or you can?t see any coolant there at all, it is definitely time to refill it.Beware that coolant reaches boiling temperatures, and it should never be opened when the engine is hot!If the coolant level has become too low, it may actually have caused air bubbles in the coolant systems, and you may need to bleed the car?s cooling system after the refill. I will cover all of this further down in the article.If you have a low coolant level, you may have a coolant leak that you need to get fixed as soon as possible.2. Malfunctioning ThermostatThermostat HousingThe thermostat is responsible for making sure that your car engine heats up quickly and holds a steady temperature once it is warm.If the thermostat fails, it can cause the engine to not reach the working temperature at all. In this case, you might find that the car?s heating system does blow warm air, but the temperature is not nearly as hot as it should be.If you see on your temperature gauge that the car is never reaching the working temperature (200 Fahrenheit or 90 degrees), there is a big risk that something is wrong with your thermostat.3. Broken Heater Flaps/Blend Door ActuatorsBlend Door ActuatorThere are flaps under your dashboard that regulate either the airflow or the coolant flow through the heating core. If one of these flaps or the electric actuators to them is defective, there is a great risk that your heater will not function as suggested.If you have a newer car with electric motors for the flaps, you will most likely get an error code on them when you scan the system with a diagnostic computer.You can also locate the flaps and see if they move when you change the heater control. If they do not, they are most likely broken. It can be difficult to see them on many car models, as they are often hidden very deep down under the dashboard.It also happens that these actuators lose their programming, and they need to be preset with a diagnostic scanner again.4. Air in the Cooling SystemBleeding Coolant SystemAir inside the coolant system is a very bad thing because it can cause overheating of your engine, which can cause severe damage to your engine.Air can come into the coolant system if the coolant level was once very low or if you replaced any parts in the coolant system recently. In rare cases, it can also come from a bad or leaky head gasket.Airlocks often get stuck in the heater core inside the car, making the car?s heater blow cold air.To get rid of air in the cooling system, you have to bleed the car?s cooling system. The process can be pretty difficult if you do not have the knowledge, so I recommend letting a repair shop do it for you.If you feel that you are comfortable enough to bleed it, you can follow our guide here: How to Bleed Your Car?s Cooling System5. Broken Heater ControlsHeater ControlsThe heating is operated via a series of controls that are available inside the car. You can change the temperature and other settings while sitting in your car. Therefore, it is possible that only the controls are stuck or broken.These controls are often made of cheap materials like plastic, which makes them very vulnerable to damage. Many YouTube videos on the internet show you how to repair the heating controls.Older cars used wires from the heater control to the actuator, and in these cars, the plastic parts the wires were attached to often broke. You do often have to replace the heater control unit for this, unfortunately.Newer cars often use totally electronic heater control units. Luckily, it is very rare that these fail, but you have to replace the whole unit if they do.6. Clogged Heater CoreHeater Core CarIf nothing seems to be working, it is possible that your heating core has gone bad or clogged. The heating core is the heart of the heating system, so your entire heating system will fail if the heating core fails.It sometimes happens that the heater core gets clogged by rust and other dirt inside the cooling system. Sometimes it is enough to flush the heater core to get rid of this, but sometimes you have to replace the whole heater core.Here is a video of how to flush the heater core: How to flush a heater coreThe heating core is an expensive component, and replacing it is often a challenging task, as it is often installed deep under the dashboard. A mechanic would charge you about $600 to $1000, depending on your car?s make and model."
How much does it cost to fix no heat in the car?	"If your heat is not working in your car, many different things can cause it. It could be low coolant, which costs 10$ to buy and refill, or it could be a broken heater core that will cost 1000-2000$ to replace."
How do I know if my heater core is clogged?	"The easiest way is to let your car warm up and turn the heat to MAX. If there is no heat blowing inside of the car, and if only one of the hoses is warm, it means that there is no flow through the heater core. This can also be caused by a faulty heater control valve, though."
How do you unclog a heater core?	"To unclog a heater core, you can try to flush it with a garden hose. Let your car cool down and remove both coolant hoses going into the cabin, then flush it with the garden hose. Flush until it starts to pour out water from the other connection."
How can I heat my car without a heater?	"Unfortunately, there is no good way to heat your car without a heater. The best way is probably to drive around with many layers of clothes on if you do not want to fix it. There are some alternative options, but these are dangerous for both you and your car."
what are the Causes Of Coolant Leaking From Hose ?	"The most common reason that coolant leaks from the hose is because of damage. The hose becomes cracked or broken. Otherwise, coolant can leak because the clamp torque isn?t sufficient or the clamp is defective. Many problems with the hoses start out because the system overheats.Let?s dive into these issues more fully. 1. Cracked Or Damaged HoseRadiator Hose ClampsThe most obvious reason that coolant would be coming from a hose is if it has become damaged. The hoses are durable but not indestructible. The constant heat and wear can take a toll on the material.At first, the damage may just be a small crack. However, left unchecked, a hole can quickly form that would cause all of the coolant to flow out. 2. Not Enough Clamp TorqueThe hoses are held on by clamps. Each of these clamps must be tightened to a specific torque to keep the hose in place.If you haven?t applied enough torque, the clamp can become loose, leading to coolant leaking out. You will see moisture coming from the hose where it meets the clamp. 3. Hose Clamp FaultyBad Radiator Hose ClampEven if you?ve applied the right amount of torque, the clamp can still be defective. Over time, the metal clamp starts to degrade and deform. If it?s not applying the right amount of pressure due to defects, the coolant will start to leak. Again, this moisture will be seen around the clamp. 4. Coolant System Overpressure or OverheatingNumerous defects can lead to a cooling system that runs too hot or is pressurized too high. When either of these situations occurs, the hose can blow out and cause a leak.One of the most prevalent issues is when a hose gets kinked. While this won?t immediately cause damage, it does reduce coolant flow leading to an overheating engine. That constant pressure takes a toll on the motor and the hoses. Eventually, something is going to blow, including one of the hoses. "
How To Fix Coolant Leaking From Hose ?	"When repairing the cooling system, it?s imperative that you fix all leaks. Otherwise, the system could still overheat from a lack of fluid and you could end up dealing with massive engine failure. Some of these fixes are simple to complete and others require advanced skills or equipment. Only perform the work you feel qualified to do. 1. Tighten Hose ClampTighten Radiator Hose ClampIt?s important that all of the hose clamps are only tightened as outlined by manufacturer specs. You don?t want to overtighten any of the clamps, just as much as you don?t want to leave them loose. Either situation can lead to leaks.Check the service manual for the proper procedure for your vehicle. In general, the right way to tighten a screw-type hose clamp is to apply pressure, but not too much that the rubber outer shell of the hose comes through the screw slot. If you go that tight, you could cut the hose. Tighten the hose and run the engine. While it?s running, watch the area around the clamp to ensure nothing is leaking. If it?s still leaking, you may need to move on to the next step. 2. Replace Hose ClampIf the clamp can?t be tightened enough to stop the leaks, you may need to replace it. While clamps are made to last a long time, they aren?t immune to defects and wear. Thankfully, most hose clamps are relatively inexpensive. You won?t break the bank to get some new clamps. 3. Replace HoseIf the hose is damaged or torn, you must replace it. Some hoses are simple to replace and others can be more difficult. Only tackle what you feel comfortable with.We recommend reading the service manual to get the appropriate procedure for your vehicle. Otherwise, you could follow these generic steps.Park on level ground. Put the car in Park and set the emergency brake. Identify the radiator hose that?s leaking. You can find the leak by running the engine and watching the hoses. Drain the coolant before removing the hose. Do this by opening the petcock found on the lower portion of the radiator. Place a bucket underneath to catch the coolant. Once the coolant has been removed, loosen up the clamps holding that radiator hose in place.Carefully work the hose off of the clamps. If you can?t get the hose off easily, use a knife to slice the hose at each end. Take off the clamps. Inspect them while they are off. If they are worn, now is also a good time to replace them.Push the new hose in place. Ensure it fits snugly and sits firmly at each attachment point.Slide the new clamps in place and tighten them to manufacturer specs. Close the petcock on the radiator. Fill the radiator with coolant. Make sure you use the right mixture and type. You also want to research how much your vehicle uses before you get started so you get it full. You also need to bleed the cooling system.Replace the radiator cap and start the engine.With a close eye on the hoses, allow the engine to reach operating temperature. If leaks still occur, shut the car down and repair them. Recheck coolant levels again after the vehicle cools down. You may need to top it off slightly. Radiator hoses may need to be replaced every four years or 60,000 miles. By regularly inspecting them, you can prevent big leaks from happening. 4. Fix Overheating Issue If the hoses or clamps fail because of overheating, you need to resolve this situation first. The engine could overheat because of low coolant levels, which is easy to fix. It could also be due to a mechanical failure, such as a defective thermostat. One often overlooked problem is a kinked hose. When a hose gets kinks in it, the coolant can?t flow as it should, leading to an overheated engine. High-quality hoses don?t tend to kink, which is why it?s best to invest in something durable. If your car hoses are kinked, the best solution is to replace them with something better. 5. Visit a Mechanic The cooling system is sophisticated and important. Therefore, if you aren?t sure exactly what you are doing, it?s best to leave the work to professionals. To start, an auto repair shop can handle the diagnosis for you and it usually won?t cost more than an hour of labor.If you don?t have the equipment to handle the repair, you can also get an estimate from the repair shop. Choose a mechanic that offers a warranty on the work and read through online reviews for peace of mind. While you may spend a little more for a high-quality mechanic, it?s worth every penny to protect the car engine from failure. "
Can I drive with a leaking coolant hose?	"You should never drive with coolant leaking from the car. As the coolant levels drop, the engine could overheat, leading to catastrophic damage. Additionally, the coolant is not good for the environment, which is another reason to have it repaired as soon as you can. "
Why is coolant leaking from the hose?	"Cooling system hoses are durable, but they will fail over time. The hose material can handle a lot of heat and abuse but eventually cracks or breaks, causing coolant to leak out. It?s also possible that you have the clamp tightened too hard, which could also cause hose damage. "
How much does it cost to fix a coolant leak from a hose?	"If you need to replace a clamp, you won?t spend a lot of money. On the other hand, replacing a radiator hose can cost much more. On average, expect to spend between $150 and $450 for the labor and parts. If you need to resolve an issue that?s leading to overheating first, the cost will go up accordingly. "
Can a coolant leak destroy the engine?	"The coolant leak itself isn?t going to cause the engine to fail, but a lack of fluid will. As the coolant leaks, there won?t be enough in the engine and it will overheat. Even if the coolant leak is minimal, it can rapidly deteriorate without you knowing. For this reason, you should have all leaks fixed immediately."
Are coolant leaks easy to fix?	"It?s not typically difficult to replace a clamp, as long as you know how tight to make it. Some radiator hoses are simple to fix, while others can be complicated. Read about the procedures in your service manual before deciding if you should tackle the repair at home or call a professional. "
Conclusion	"If there?s coolant leaking from a hose on your car, it?s time to take prompt action. You don?t want coolant leaking or the engine could be damaged. Repair the leak yourself or visit a local mechanic. While it may cost a little bit upfront to have it repaired, it?s nothing compared to the cost of replacing the engine because of neglect."
What Would Cause Oil To Spray All Over The Engine?	"Trying to troubleshoot why your engine is spraying oil everywhere can be tricky. Read our guide to help you diagnose the issue and get it fixed fast.Oil Leaking On EngineMotor oil is required in the engine to ensure proper lubrication. If there?s a problem with the mechanics, oil could spray on the motor, leaving the levels lower than they should be. But, what would cause oil to spray all over the engine, and what can be done about it?As certified mechanics, we see this problem more frequently than you would think. That?s why we are able to answer your questions and steer you in the right direction. We also take some time at the end of the article to resolve a few issues you?ve been pondering. "
Reasons For Oil Spraying All Over The Engine ?	"It?s never normal to have oil sprayed on the engine, but some issues are easy to resolve. It?s possible that the oil dipstick isn?t seated or the oil cap is loose. You may also have a leaking oil filter, leaking gasket, overfilled engine oil or high crankcase ventilation pressure.A quick look at these possibilities helps you determine what?s wrong. 1. Oil Dipstick Is Not Seated ProperlyOil DipstickThe oil dipstick helps you determine how much fluid is in the engine. It?s the part you pull out to see if the engine needs more oil. If the dipstick doesn?t go in all the way, it can lead to a lot of trouble. When pressure builds up in the engine, oil can leak, and the levels can drop too low.If the dipstick doesn?t go in, you may have the wrong one for your vehicle. These parts are not universal. Otherwise, it?s possible that the tube has become damaged or there?s an obstruction blocking the way. 2. Oil Cap LooseEngine Oil CapThe oil cap is also important. It?s meant to keep contaminants and dirt from getting into the engine. If the oil cap is missing or loose, the fluid could start to spray up on the engine. Additionally, dirt can now get into the engine and cause major damage.At the first sign of damage to the oil cap, it?s best to get a replacement. Because the oil cap is inexpensive to replace, you shouldn?t procrastinate. Just like the oil dipstick, the cap is also not universal. You must make sure the replacement you purchase fits your vehicle. 3. Leaking Oil FilterOil Filter Top EngineIf you?ve just had an oil change and notice fluid all over the engine, the problem could be the filter. The filter should be replaced with every oil change, as per most manufacturers? recommendations. However, the filter may not have been installed properly, leading to a big mess. Drivers experience this problem when visiting a lube location that?s not experienced. For this reason alone, it?s wise not to go anywhere based on price alone, or you may end up with larger issues. The only solution to this problem is to replace the oil filter again. You would also need to install a new rubber gasket. 4. Leaking GasketBest Oil Stop Leak AdditivesIf you notice oil leaking out onto the engine, you need to inspect the motor and all of its gaskets. Your engine has several gaskets that keep the oil within the motor. If parts have been over-torqued, the gasket could become deformed and leak. It?s also possible that the gasket wasn?t installed right to begin with. The main ones that leak onto the engine include the valve cover gasket, the head gasket or the intake manifold. When the head gasket blows, boiling hot oil spews out from between the engine and the cylinder head. 5. Overfilled Engine OilThere?s a specific amount of oil every engine needs. Determining the motor oil capacity is essential to regulating the fluid level. When you perform an oil change, you want to slowly fill the engine back up. Check the levels often and stop before it goes over the MAX line. If you put too much oil in the engine the crankcase pressure will rise and the motor could push out hot liquid. This spray would end up on the engine, thereby voiding the warranty. If the engine runs low, it can also lead to damage. 6. High Crankcase Ventilation PressureThe positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve regulates the pressure in the crankcase. When this part fails, the pressure can become too high, leading to oil blowing out of the dipstick.The high pressure can also be caused by incorrect oil levels or engine blow-by. Either way, permanent damage will occur, so you don?t want to mess around. "
How To Fix An Engine Spraying Oil Everywhere ?	"At the first sign of a leaking engine, you want to take quick action. For the best results, follow the same steps we would as a professional mechanic. 1. Clean The EngineClean EngineBefore you can go any further, you must first clean the oil off of the engine. Here are steps to clean the engine bay.Work with a cool engine. Do not clean a hot engine.Remove any dry debris or dirt that can be cleaned with a brush.Unhook the battery and protect any electronics with plastic.Protect the alternator with a plastic bagApply a degreaser and scrub it with your detailing brush.Rinse it off gently with a pressure washer.Wipe the engine down with a microfiber cloth. Reattach the battery.If there?s burnt-on oil that?s difficult to remove, you can use some WD-40. A small brush helps you get into tight spaces. You can also get a professional to clean the engine if you don?t have time for the detail job. Many local car washes and professional detailers offer services for the engine. 2. Start The EngineOnce you?ve cleaned it all up, you won?t want to mess it back up. We completely understand, but this step is vital to fixing the problem.Start the engine up and wait a few minutes. Let the engine run or take it for a quick spin until the oil starts to leak. If you decide to take the car for a drive, the oil may blow more than expected, making it more difficult to figure out where it?s coming from. 3. Look For Any Signs Of LeaksInspect EngineNow, it?s time to inspect the engine. Because the surface is clean, it should be easy to spot where the oil is coming from now. If you are unfamiliar with what you are looking at, consider using the service manual. The factory service manual provides helpful diagrams and schematics. 4. Find the Reason for the High Crankcase PressureIf the dipstick keeps blowing up and high crankcase pressure is causing the oil leak, you must perform more diagnostics to determine what?s creating it. Start by checking the oil level to make sure it?s where it should be.Beyond this, the diagnosis might get more complicated. You need to check the engine compression and the PCV valve. 5. Contact A ProfessionalWorking with the engine isn?t a job that everyone can tackle. It?s taken a lot of experience for us to know what we are looking at to have the discernment needed to repair the motor. If you aren?t familiar with the engine problems, take your car to a mechanic. The motor is too expensive and important to take chances with it. "
Can I drive with spilled oil on the engine?	"In most cases, a small amount of spilled oil isn?t going to hurt. While the oil burns off, you may notice some white or blue smoke coming from where the oil was spilled. Until the oil burns completely, you may deal with this smoke, along with some burning smells. However, oil on the exhaust manifold could end up in a fire if you are unlucky and driving your car hard, so therefore it?s better to fix it as soon as possible."
Can spilling oil on the engine cause a fire?	"Motor oil isn?t a very flammable liquid, so it usually doesn?t start on fire. After all, it does flow through the engine at extreme temperatures. However, there?s always the risk of danger simply because it?s combustible. In some situations, a fire could occur if a large amount ends up on the exhaust manifold or catalytic converter. "
What happens if oil gets all over your car?	"A large amount of spilled oil can cause problems. The serpentine belt could slip off while driving, which would lead to a lack of vital functions. The oil could also become a fire hazard because of the combustibility. Instead of driving with the oil everywhere, clean the engine before heading out. "
How likely is an oil leak to catch fire?	"It?s unlikely that a small oil leak will cause an engine fire. Motor oil isn?t considered flammable, which is why it can flow through the engine under high temperatures. However, it?s not impossible for a car fire to start if it ends up on a hot exhaust part, which is why you don?t want to ignore any leaking engine oil. "
Conclusion	"There?s no normal situation that would cause oil to spray on the car engine. At the first sign of spraying motor oil, you want to take action. A thorough inspection is necessary to discover what?s causing the problem. It shouldn?t be difficult to find where the oil is coming from, especially if you cleaned the engine first.Follow the steps outlined in our guide and you may gain quick answers to your questions. If not, you know that a certified mechanic will be able to get to the bottom of the oil leak."
What Causes Engine Oil To Smell Like Gas?	"In normal circumstances, the motor oil shouldn?t smell like gas. This normally happens because of short driving distances or a lack of oil changes. It can also occur because of a rich fuel mixture, bad piston rings, a faulty fuel injector, or a failing carburetor. Here is a more detailed list of why your oil smells like gas.1. Frequent Short Distance DrivingDriving Car For GroceriesDuring normal drives, gas can drip down to the oil pan. This isn?t anything alarming, as the gas vaporizes once the oil pan starts to heat up.However, if you are only traveling short distances, the oil won?t ever get hot enough to vaporize the fuel. What you are left with is a gasoline smell. 2. Too Rich Fuel MixtureFuel Injector SprayFor combustion to occur, there must be a perfect balance between air and fuel. When there?s too much gas, it?s defined as a too rich fuel mixture. The opposite would be if there was too much air, which would be a too lean situation. Problems with a sensor can be to blame. Your system relies on a multitude of sensors to balance the mixture. If the intake air temperature sensor, O2 sensor, coolant temperature sensor, mass airflow sensor or MAP sensor malfunctions, all of these can lead to a rich-running situation. As a result, the gas will build up on the oil pan as it seeps through the piston rings. 3. Bad Piston RingsPiston Ring FunctionWhile we are on the subject of piston rings, you must consider what happens when these get damaged. If there?s even a small amount of damage to the rings, fuel can leak into the oil pan, leaving behind a fuel smell. While the rings don?t become damaged too easily, this problem can be a bear to deal with. A compression test would be necessary, which we discuss in detail further down in the guide. 4. Faulty Fuel InjectorBad Fuel InjectorToday?s cars utilize fuel injectors that ensure the engine has the right amount of gas. A solenoid commands the injectors to regulate the flow and the computer calculates what?s needed. Extra gas leaks into the oil when the solenoid gets broken. If it remains in an open position, gas will also leak and blend together with oil. The more it occurs, the stronger the gasoline smell is. Bad injectors can also lead to engine performance issues, even a possible misfire.  5. Oil Change Not Done According To ScheduleOil Change CarEven under normal operating conditions, a small amount of gas can make it into the oil. There don?t need to be any major mechanical issues for this to occur. Because the fuel is minimal in the oil, you normally wouldn?t smell it. However, if you aren?t performing regular service and changing the oil, the fuel smell can start to compound. What you are left with is a gasoline smell, along with dirty and contaminated oil. For this reason, it?s always best to follow the manufacturer?s recommended maintenance schedule outlined in the owner?s manual. 6. Faulty Carburetor (Older Vehicles)CarburetorToday?s modern cars don?t have a carburetor, but once upon a time, they all came with one. If you have an older vehicle, you must consider that the carburetor may be to blame. If the motor oil starts to smell like fuel, the carburetor may be damaged.Inside the carburetor, the float is responsible for allowing fuel into the engine. If the float sticks, too much fuel mixes with air. As the fuel makes its way into the oil pan, you will start to smell that gas stench. "
How To Fix Oil Smelling Like Gas ?	"Once you smell gas in the oil, it?s time to take action. Hopefully, the problem is nothing serious, allowing you to perform a quick fix and get back on the road. However, if you don?t resolve the situation, it could turn into something larger. Here are the steps we would take as professional mechanics. 1. Drive More Often And For LongerRoad TripIt?s important to start off by evaluating how you drive. Driving short distances isn?t good for the car and it can lead to a gas smell. To change this, consider combining trips, so you are out for a longer period at once.You need to drive long enough for the engine to reach a higher operating temperature. That?s when the gas will start to burn out of the oil pan, so you no longer have that smell anymore. 2. Check Trouble CodesObd2 CodesIf there?s a Check Engine Light on, you want to read the codes to see what?s causing the problem. Plug in your OBDII scanner and see what codes show up. You may also use freeze frame data to determine what?s going on. If you aren?t familiar with the DTCs, you can reference the information with our online code library. Perform whatever fix seems relevant and reset the codes to see if the problem resolves itself. If not, you should continue working through our steps. 3. Check CompressionAn engine compression test checks the pistons? and valves? ability to compress the air and fuel mixture. You don?t need a lot of mechanical experience to perform the test, but you will need some specialized tools. Here are some basic steps to follow.Gather your equipment: You don?t want to search for your tools after you get started. You can rent one locally if you don?t have a compression tester. Disable fuel/ignition: The engine cannot run during the testing. Older vehicles with a distributor can be disabled at the coil. Fuel-injected cars need to be disabled at the fuel system. Look in the owner?s manual to find the fuel pump fuse and remove it. Take out the spark plugs: During the testing, you don?t want compression strokes hindering the spinning. Start the test: Hook up the compression testing tool. Spin the engine at least six times for the gauge to read properly. Keep your hands clear of all pulleys and belts. Record your readings: Write down the readings as you go for reference. Most gas engines have a compression between 125 and 175 PSI. Evaluate the reading: If one reading is lower than the others, there might be a problem with a cylinder. If you have several lower numbers, other engine issues may be present. Remember to hook everything back up after the compression test. If you?ve disabled the fuel or ignition system, it?s time to put it back together.4. Change Engine OilIf it?s time to change the oil, you may consider seeing if this fixes your problem. Most cars with conventional oil need to be changed every 3,000 miles. If you use synthetic motor oil, you may be able to go 7,500 miles or more. Check the service schedule for your particular car model to get accurate information.Here are some basic steps to consider. Jack up the car and secure it on jack stands.Place an oil drain pan under the oil plug and open it.Allow the oil to drain out completely. Remove the old oil filter.Put the drain plug back in.Install the new oil filter.Fill the system back up with oil.Check the levels and top off as needed. It?s also important to check for leaks. If you notice any leaks, you want to fix them before the problem gets worse. 5. Contact A ProfessionalIf you need to find a mechanic, talk to your family and friends to see who?s recommended. The Federal Trade Commission also recommends asking to see current licenses from the mechanic. You may have to pay for the diagnostics, but the shop should give you a detailed estimate before performing a bunch of repair work. Sometimes, it?s just better to pay this bill versus banging your head against the wall trying to figure out what?s wrong. "
Does gas in the oil damage the engine?	"In small amounts, gas in the oil won?t hurt the engine. However, if there?s an excessive amount of fuel in the oil, it can reduce the viscosity. With thinner oil running through the motor, the internal parts don?t get the lubrication needed and there?s minimal protection, leading to a higher chance of damage. "
How do I know if gas is in your oil?	"The most obvious symptom is the smell of fuel in the oil. You may also see white smoke coming from the exhaust and the oil pressure gauge may read slightly lower. Finally, if the oil level is rising without you adding more, it could be due to fuel leaking into the system. "
How do I test for gas in the engine oil?	"The sniff test may be all that?s needed. If you smell gas in the oil, it?s probably present. You can also put a few drops of the oil from the dipstick on a piece of cardboard. If there?s any gas in the oil, two rings will appear on the cardboard within minutes. The outer ring is the fuel with the oil in the middle. "
What happens if gas mixes with oil in the engine?	"Nothing will happen from a small amount of gas in the oil. However, when there?s lots of fuel in the oil, viscosity is reduced. With thinner oil, the internal parts receive less lubrication, so there?s minimal protection, leading to a higher chance of engine damage."
How do I remove gas from oil?	"First, you have to figure out what?s causing the problem and fix it. There?s no sense in doing anything else until you stop the flow of fuel into the oil. Once that?s done, you can change the oil and filter. With fresh oil in the motor and the problem resolved, you shouldn?t notice any more fuel infiltration. "
Conclusion	"As professional mechanics, we are constantly dealing with strange smells coming from vehicles. One that always catches our attention is the smell of fuel in the oil. These two substances aren?t made to be mixed together, so quick action is required.If you can repair the problem on your own, go for it. We always encourage saving money by avoiding a visit to a repair shop. However, if you aren?t familiar with these systems or you are unsure how to fix them, you should visit a local mechanic. A lot can go wrong when you work with the engine, so don?t take any chances. "
How Many Miles Can I Go Over An Oil Change?	"You should never exceed the maintenance schedule, even for a few miles. If you allow the oil to become contaminated, the engine endures more wear and tear, thereby reducing its life. The recommended oil change schedule is in place to keep the engine running at its best.While it?s never wise to prolong an oil change, there are times to have them more frequently than recommended. If you tow heavy loads or drive down rough roads, your vehicle might need more frequent changes. If you drive over the maintenance schedule, you could also run into issues with the manufacturer?s warranty or insurance if something breaks down in your vehicle."
Why I Shouldn?t Go Over An Oil Change ?	"Motor oil is needed to lubricate the engine and keep the temperature regulated. With all of the internal parts lubricated, metal doesn?t rub and creates excessive friction. While the oil moves through the engine, it also pulls heat from the motor and carries away any small particles of metal or dirt.As the oil is exposed to heat continually, it loses effectiveness. Dirt circulates through the broken-down oil and oxidation begins. This process eventually leads to the production of sludge, which can?t be moved through the engine efficiently. Aside from that, all of these contaminants start to build up in the oil filter, which can become clogged.Instead of protecting the car engine, the dirty sludge starts to wear away at the components. The only solution is to perform expensive repairs. Instead of dealing with these problems, why not get the oil change when it?s recommended? A typical oil change costs anywhere from $40 to $125, which is a fraction of what the bill will be if something fails. Another benefit to having regular oil changes is better fuel economy. With fresh oil and a new filter, the engine can run efficiently. The reward for that is less money spent at the pump. It?s much more difficult for the motor to run well when it?s trying to push thick dark sludge around. For these reasons, it?s important to pay attention to the little sticker the shop puts on your windshield. Keep track of the mileage and get your oil changes whenever they are recommended. "
How Often Should I Get An Oil Change?	"There was a time when all cars required an oil change every 3,000 miles. All cars back in the day used traditional motor oil that broke down quickly. Modern vehicles are made with more advanced technology. Engines have been upgraded and most cars can go longer than this, even with conventional oil. On average, cars using conventional oil need an oil change every 5,000 to 7,500 miles. If you put synthetic oil in the engine, it can go even longer. In normal driving conditions, it?s expected that the car could go anywhere from 7,500 to 15,000 miles.Aside from the type of motor oil used, there are some other factors that can change the frequency. You must also consider the following:The type of car you driveHow you drive your vehicleThe environment you drive inThe age of the vehicleThe numbers are not concrete; they are simply recommendations. It?s always best to reference the maintenance schedule provided by the manufacturer. You can find these recommendations in the owner?s manual or talk to your local dealership. "
what are the Signs It?s Time To Replace The Oil ?	"Aside from the mileage recommendations, how else would you know when to change the oil? Thankfully, there are signs that indicate the oil should be changed. You may need to change it more frequently because of how you drive your vehicle, so it?s important to pay attention to these signs. 1. Dark and Dirty OilWhen oil is fresh, it has an amber color and is transparent. You can see through it. As the oil breaks down, the color and texture begin to change.As dust, dirt and contaminants start to build up, the oil is going to appear dirty. After it completely breaks down, it turns black. If it?s left go longer than this, the engine oil will become sludge, which is very dangerous. That?s why we recommend checking the oil often. You want to pull out the dipstick to check the consistency and the color. If it?s thick and dark, it?s time to change it and the oil filter.2. Engine Noises or KnockingYou should be used to the normal sounds of your car engine. The regular purr it makes should be music to your ears. If this normal sound turns into something odd, it?s time to take notice.As the oil breaks down, the metal parts inside of the engine don?t get the lubrication needed. Without the right viscosity of oil flowing through, the engine can start making unusual sounds, including knocking. Before the problem gets any worse, you should change the oil. 3. Oil Change or Check Engine LightOn your car?s dashboard, there is a multitude of lights letting you know when something is wrong. You could see an Oil Change or Maintenance Required Light reminding you that it?s time for service, or the Check Engine Light could come on in extreme situations.Either way, your dashboard lights should never be ignored. Provide the maintenance that?s needed and read any trouble codes with your OBDII scanner to see what?s wrong. 4. Oil Warning LightThe oil warning light is another indicator that is found on the dash. This light doesn?t typically come on just because it?s time for an oil change. However, if neglecting the oil change causes it to become thick, it may not circulate through the system properly. Without the right amount of circulation, oil pressure can drop, which would lead to the indicator light. If you see this warning, it?s important that you stop driving right away. Any lack of oil pressure could lead to engine damage. "
How Long Does an Oil Change Take?	"If you are putting off having an oil change done because you don?t have the time, you should know that this task is short and easy. If you prefer to do the oil change yourself, you may spend an hour or less from start to completion. This includes all of the time it takes to gather the supplies and jack up your vehicle.On the other hand, if you drive into a local lube station or visit the express lane at a dealership, your time could be even less. Many of these establishments pride themselves on getting oil changes done within thirty minutes or less. If appointments are allowed, you can cut down your time even more by calling ahead.Considering how quickly an oil change takes, it doesn?t make sense to put it off. Get the oil changed during a lunch break or while you are waiting to pick up the kids from an after-school activity. "
Can I go 1000 miles over an oil change?	"It may not be catastrophic to go a little over one oil change, but you should never make a habit of the practice. Maintenance schedules indicate the best time to have service done and who would know better than the manufacturer of your car? Follow all maintenance guidelines if you want the engine to keep running at optimal levels. Exceeding the schedule could cause issues with the insurance or warranty."
Can I go 100 miles past the oil change?	"One hundred miles doesn?t seem like a big deal and it probably isn?t in a pinch. However, you don?t want to continually miss your regular oil change or engine damage could start to occur. For the price of an oil change, it?s best to stay on track and get the maintenance done. Your engine will thank you and exceeding the schedule could cause issues with the insurance or warranty."
What happens if I miss an oil change?	"If you forget to have the oil changed, you want to take it for service right away. Don?t wait until the next scheduled maintenance interval to have this vital task performed. The longer that dirty, contaminated oil is allowed to circulate in the engine, the more damage it can cause. "
Is it OK to go 500 miles over your oil change?	"We don?t ever recommend missing an oil change interval, but one time of going over probably won?t hurt anything. The key is to get all of the maintenance done when it?s recommended the majority of the time. You should treat maintenance as an insurance policy, helping you keep the engine in pristine condition. Exceeding the maintenance schedule could cause issues with the insurance or warranty."
Conclusion	"It may seem like the local lube is trying to rob you of money by having you change the oil so often, but they aren?t. Regular oil changes are vital to keeping the motor running right. By changing the oil, you ensure the metal components inside receive the lubrication that?s desperately needed. Without this lubrication, the metal pieces can break down and the engine could overheat.The next time your vehicle is due for an oil change, have it done. Don?t put off what should be done right away. You?ll be happy that it?s over until the next time and the car will reward you with optimal performance."
Should I Check The Engine Oil Level Hot Or Cold?	"For most users, it?s best to check the engine oil levels while it?s cold. If you prefer to check it when it?s warm, you want to wait for a minimum of 15 minutes after the engine was last run. That?s about the time it takes for the oil to come down into the pan fully.For optimal safety, you want to wait until oil temperatures have returned to normal. That?s because the oil temperature can easily reach 250 degrees Fahrenheit. With that said, new cars that have electronic oil level controllers only allow for a proper measurement when the oil is warm. The car must also be parked on a flat and level surface. For this reason, today?s manufacturers recommend more and more that drivers check the engine oil when it?s warm. It seems to provide a more accurate result. Just don?t read the engine oil directly when it?s hot. In our opinion, the important part isn?t whether the oil is hot or cold when you check the oil, but rather that you give the oil time to drain back into the oil pan after the car has run. The oil must have drained back into the oil pan in order for you to get an accurate reading."
Does Oil Type Matter?	"You have a big decision to make when performing an oil change. Conventional oil is cheaper, but it also doesn?t hold up as well over time. Synthetic oil, on the other hand, is going to provide the best amount of lubrication, but that improved performance comes at a cost. So, what do these types of oil have to do with when you should check levels?Oil types have varying expansion and contraction rates based on temperature. For example, synthetic oil has the highest expansion and contraction rate with temperature fluctuations. When cold, the synthetic oil will contract more, and when it is hot, it expands significantly.With regular conventional oil, the expansion and contraction tend to remain the same under all temperature situations. For the most part, you should see the same reading whether it is hot or cold. No matter what oil type you choose, it?s important that the level is between the recommended lines on the dipstick. If you need to top off the engine, use the same type of oil that?s already in the system. Don?t mix different types of oils, such as synthetic and conventional, unless absolutely necessary. "
How To Check my Engine Oil Accurately  ?	"If you are ready to check your engine oil levels, you don?t need to have a lot of expertise. We suggest that you first read your car owner?s manual to see if there are any manufacturer specifications that must be followed. Beyond that, these general guidelines should help. 1. Drive Car For 10 MinutesTest DriveIf you have a newer vehicle, you should take the car for a short drive. You don?t need to get it up to highway speeds or do anything substantial. In fact, a short ten-minute drive should be more than enough. You just want to get the oil circulating in the system. If you prefer to err on the side of safety and you drive an older vehicle, there?s no reason to take the car for a drive. You can pick up the instructions at step 3 and check the oil while it is cold. 2. Let The Car Sit For 15 MinutesYou don?t want to check the oil as soon as you stop driving. Instead, it?s important that you allow the oil time to cool off slightly until it?s just warm. This process shouldn?t take much longer than 15 minutes if you only take a short drive. Set a timer so you don?t forget to check it at the appropriate time. Additionally, you want to leave the engine off while you check the oil. 3. Park On A Flat SurfaceTo get an accurate oil level, you need the car to be as flat as possible. Find a level spot in your driveway and park here. If you don?t have a level spot, you may need to take the car somewhere else to check the oil. Otherwise, all of the oil will move to the back or front of the engine, depending on where the elevation is. 4. Find the DipstickEngine Oil DipstickPop the hood to gain access to the engine. The oil dipstick will be clearly marked, normally with an orange or yellow circular handle. You?ll know you have the right dipstick if it comes out as a long metal piece. When it slides out of the engine, the liquid color should be amber-brown to darker black. If your dipstick looks different or the fluid color is different, you may want to verify that you?ve chosen the right one. Your owner?s manual should provide more information. 5. Remove the DipstickNow that you know where the oil dipstick is, you are ready to pull it out. It should slide easily out of the tube without much resistance.Have a shop towel ready because you will need to clean it up. Wipe down the dipstick and put it back in the tube. 6. Return the DipstickEngine Oil LevelOnce the dipstick has been reinserted, you need to remove it once more. Take a look at the oil dipstick to see where the oil level is. If the oil is fresh, the liquid will be an amber color. Otherwise, if the oil is old, it could be dark brown or black. Most cars have a line that shows you when it?s empty and full. Ideally, your oil level will be located between these lines. With this information in hand, you are ready to fill up the oil if it?s too low. If it?s time for an oil change, you may prefer to hold off on the top off and go forward with the regular maintenance instead. For best results, don?t forget to replace the engine oil filter at the same time that you change the fluid. "
What Temperature Should I Check The Oil At?	"Back in the day, everyone checked the oil level when the engine was cold. This was determined to be the safest method of checking fluid levels. These days, modern cars are meant to be checked with warm oil, 5 to 10 minutes after the engine was last run. For this reason, it might be better to run the engine for a short time and let it cool off before seeing where the oil is on the dipstick. "
Is It Ok To Check Oil When Engine Is Hot?	"There?s never a reason to check oil levels when the engine is hot. Motor oil can be extremely hot, so checking it would only put you at risk for a burn. Instead, you can run the engine for 10 minutes and let it cool off for 15 minutes before checking the oil levels. "
Does Oil Level Go Down When Cold?	"The oil level shouldn?t differ much from when it?s warm or cold. However, most modern cars recommend checking the engine oil when it?s slightly warmed up. Inspection at this time seems to bring the most accurate results. Check the owner?s manual for your vehicle to see what?s recommended. "
How Long Does my Car Have To Sit Before You Check The Oil?	"In older vehicles, you can check the oil when the engine is completely cold. You don?t need to run the engine at all. In fact, this used to be the recommended practice for safety purposes. Today?s modern cars have some different guidelines, suggesting that you run the car for ten minutes and let it sit for another 15 before checking the oil. This procedure allows the oil to be warm, but not so hot that it?s dangerous. "
Does Oil Level Go Down When Hot?	"When you warm up the engine, you allow the oil to circulate through the motor. To get it to settle back into place, you want to allow the engine to cool down, but only slightly. You don?t want the engine to be completely cold, but it can also be dangerous to check the levels while the motor is hot. "
Conclusion	"For older cars, it is better to check the oil when the engine is cold. This time allows the engine oil to drain fully into the pan for an accurate reading. However, newer guidance suggests that the latest models should be lightly driven and cooled down, so the oil can be checked when the engine is warm.It?s not always easy discerning the best practices for your vehicle, which is why we always recommend checking with the manufacturer. What?s most important is that you are checking the oil levels regularly and that you are performing all of the necessary maintenance. Learning how to check the oil can save you from disastrous consequences down the road. You don?t need any mechanical experience to perform this simple procedure. Follow the steps outlined above and take steps to ensure reliable transportation for years into the future. "
what are Normal Engine Oil Pressure?	"The oil pressure of a vehicle depends on what make and model it is. In general, the normal oil pressure will fall somewhere between 20 and 65 PSI. You can find your vehicle?s specifications in the service manual. Anything outside the recommended range is considered bad.Your motor?s oil pressure shows how much resistance the lubricant faces when traveling through the various passages of your car engine. The majority of cars have an oil pressure gauge on the dashboard, so you can see how high or low it is at any time.When you initially start up the vehicle, the oil pressure may be higher than normal. Once the engine warms up to its normal operating temperature, the oil pressure reading should be normal. It?s usually measured by PSI or pounds per square inch. "
Why is Normal Oil Pressure Important?	"The oil pressure rating shows how much resistance the lubricant faces as it travels through the passages. When everything is in optimal condition, the oil pressure is going to be normal. Any time that the oil pressure is low or high, it indicates that there?s a problem. By knowing where it should be, you can head off bigger problems before they cost you too much.Either way, the oil needs to get to every engine component. Otherwise, those parts of the engine aren?t getting the lubrication they need. Without lubrication, friction increases and component damage is sure to follow. "
what are the Main Causes of High Oil Pressure ?	"1. Dirty Oil FilterBad Oil FilterThe engine oil filter is responsible for keeping the contaminants out of the combustion chamber. Over time, soot, dust and other debris are going to build up on the filter, which is why it should be changed with every oil change.If the filter isn?t changed, the oil won?t be able to flow normally, which could lead to increased pressure in the system. The higher the resistance goes, the more the pressure rises. 2. Diminished Oil QualityThe reason for changing the oil frequently is to keep the contaminants out of the lubricant. If these contaminants build up, the quality of the oil is sacrificed.Because these contaminants reduce friction, more resistance occurs. This resistance can lead to an increase in pressure. 3. Wrong Oil ViscosityEvery engine uses a specific type of oil with a particular viscosity rating. The more viscous the oil is, the more resistance it has when traveling through the passageways. This higher viscosity increases pressure.If you choose a thinner or thicker oil, you will alter the pressure that is noticed in the system. Additionally, you have to keep in mind that oil becomes thinner after it heats up, so viscosity is also adjusted by heat. 4. Blocked PassagesThe oil moves through the filter into various passages that lead to the engine. If any of the passages get blocked, oil won?t be able to pass as efficiently, leading to a lack of lubrication.With more resistance, the oil pressure will rise. The obstruction can also lead to engine failure, as lubrication doesn?t occur. 5. Bad Relief ValveThe relief valve is needed to allow oil the chance to escape if the pressure rises. The valves will open once the PSI reaches a certain level.If this relief valve no longer functions as it should, the oil has nowhere to escape. Because of this defect, the pressure will build up until it is no longer safe for the motor. "
what are the Main Causes of Low Oil Pressure ?	"1. Low Oil LevelLow Oil LevelThe dipstick shows how much oil should be in the system. If this level drops too low, you could face reduced pressure within the engine. The engine will burn some oil over time, which is why it?s important to check the levels frequently. Also, if a leak occurs, the oil level will decrease until the pressure drops. 2. Wrong ViscosityAs we discussed earlier, the oil viscosity plays a major part in the pressure level. If the oil is too thick, it might increase the oil pressure because of the heightened resistance. Lower viscosity has the opposite effect on the pressure. That?s why it?s important to follow the recommendations set out by the automaker. 3. Clogged FilterWe had the clogged filter in our section on high pressure, but it also belongs here. It depends on where the oil pressure sensor is located. If it is placed before the filter, it will show a high pressure when the filter is clogged. If it is placed after the filter, it will show a low oil pressure when it is clogged.If the oil can no longer flow through the engine, pressure will drop. That?s why you should always replace the filter when you change the oil. 4. Failing Oil PumpThe oil pump is responsible for regulating pressure. If the pump begins to malfunction, low pressure is sure to follow. The engine could also stall and the temperature may rise. Aside from that, there will be a lack of power without the necessary oil to run the engine. 5. Engine WearIf the engine is getting old and starting to wear, low oil pressure is common. Inside the engine, there are lots of moving parts that need to be well-lubricated to avoid damage. Any components in the engine, including the bearings, can fail at any moment, causing a dramatic drop in oil pressure.Sadly, there?s no way to tell how long the engine will last before damage occurs. However, you can keep it in its best condition by providing regular maintenance and fixing problems as soon as they occur. "
what are Normal Oil Pressure at Idle?	"The oil pressure will be slightly lower at idle, normally between 20 and 30 PSI on most car engines. Normally, it won?t go below the specified parameters set by the manufacturer. If the oil pressure drops too low during idle, it could indicate that the level is low and needs to be topped off. "
Is It Better to Have High or Low Oil Pressure?	"Neither of these situations is ideal, and you don?t want to face either, but high oil pressure is usually slightly better than low oil pressure. But, engine damage can occur when the oil pressure is too high, just as it would if the oil pressure dropped too low. For that reason, it?s imperative to have your car looked at if the oil pressure gauge reads low or high. "
Does Oil Pressure Go Up As I Drive?	"You may notice a slight increase in oil pressure as you accelerate. This condition is completely normal because the motor is working harder, so it needs more pressure. However, the pressure should never go beyond what?s considered normal by the manufacturer. "
Conclusion	"The only way to know that it has exceeded normal parameters is to verify what the pressure should be. If you are keeping a close eye on the oil pressure of your car, you may notice it becomes too high or too low. With both of these conditions, it?s important to seek help right away from a technician to avoid any permanent engine damage"
How Much Does an Oil Pan Replacement Cost?	"The average oil pan replacement cost is between $250 and $1,000, depending on the car model and who installs the new oil pan. The oil pan itself may cost $150 to $500, including a drain plug and oil pan gasket, with the rest being labor costs.It?s difficult to determine a precise cost since the labor for replacement varies so greatly. Some people may be able to get the job accomplished for $250, while others can cost $1,500 or more. It all depends on the type of vehicle you drive, who is installing the new oil pan, and what other parts are required."
Factors Affecting Oil Pan Replacement Cost	"1. Vehicle Make/ModelThe most important factor is what type of vehicle you are driving. As with any auto part, prices can vary for the components themselves. It will matter if you are driving a compact vehicle or something more heavy-duty.Additionally, there are some vehicles that have a more labor-intensive replacement procedure. In fact, some vehicles require the engine to be pulled to get to the oil pan, which can become quite costly to do. 2. DIY vs. ProfessionalIf you plan to perform the oil pan replacement at home, you could save yourself a lot of money. All you would need to pay for is the parts.Otherwise, you are liable for paying a professional for the replacement. If you live in an area with a high labor rate, this cost can add up pretty quickly. 3. Other Parts RequiredIf the oil pan needs to be replaced, it?s likely you might need other parts as well. During the installation, the technician might want to replace the oil plug, oil pan gasket or an oil plug gasket.Sometimes, the oil pan comes with the plug and gaskets, especially if it is a complete kit. If that?s the case, you may be able to save some money. Just don?t forget that the engine will also need to be refilled with oil too. "
what are the Oil Pan?	"The oil pan is needed for exactly what it sounds like. It?s the pan that holds the engine oil for your vehicle.This pan looks like a tray, and it acts as a reservoir. The oil sits in the pan before it is pumped into the engine. Typically, this tray is made from aluminum or steel, and it gets bolted at the bottom of the motor. Oil Pan Parts1. Oil Pan GasketOil Pan GasketBetween the oil pan land the engine block, there needs to be something that helps to seal it. A gasket acts as this barrier and is sometimes installed with a sealant that keeps the oil from leaking.This gasket is made from a rubber material, fibers or cork ring. Over time, this gasket can break down and cause problems. For this reason, it?s best to replace it while you already have the oil pan off. 2. Drain Plug & GasketOil Drain PlugInserted into the drain pan is the plug. This is the part that gets removed when you do an oil change. With the plug out, the oil can drain. With the plug is also a gasket. With the help of this gasket, oil won?t leak through the threaded area of the drain plug. 3. Baffle/Windage TraySome vehicles also use a baffle or windage tray in the pan. This metal sheet helps to prevent oil from sloshing around as you go through turns.It can also prevent contamination of the crankshaft. Some trays also include a scraper mechanism that removes any oil that may have sloshed around. "
Reasons Why Oil Pan Fails ?	"1. ImpactThe main reason that an oil pan fails is because of an impact. If you run something over in your car, it could cause damage to the oil pan, which is sitting underneath the engine.It?s also possible that the damage stems from an accident you?ve had. Either way, you might start to notice oil leaking from under the car. 2. CorrosionBecause the oil pan is made from metal, it can easily corrode. As the car gets older, the metal will oxidize until rust starts to form.Corrosion can occur even faster if you live in a salty area, such as near the beach or if you regularly drive on winter-treated roadways. If so, you would do better to get the undercarriage of your vehicle washed regularly to ensure all of this salt is removed. 3. Worn GasketIn some cases, people think that the oil pan has failed when it?s just the gasket that?s leaking. As the vehicle ages, the gasket material will start to break down. It can also fail from the constant fluctuation between extreme heat and regular ambient temperatures.With rubber gaskets, the material will harden over time and lose elasticity. Either way, you may not need an oil pan replacement if the problem is just from the gasket. "
How to Replace Oil Pan?	"1. Gather SuppliesMotor Oil PanIf you plan on replacing the oil pan yourself, it?s best to gather all of your supplies before you get started. Otherwise, you could find yourself in the middle of the project running to the store. With a few simple tools, it?s normally easy to get the old oil pan off. However, that?s not always the case, especially if you drive a car that requires pulling the engine for replacement. For this reason, we advise you to read the service manual first.Once that?s done, gather these tools and equipment.Floor jack and jack standsNew oil pan & kitFresh motor oil (whatever viscosity and type is recommended)Socket wrenchOil filterSealantClean ragsIn addition to these items, you want to gather anything else listed in your service manual. With your equipment ready, you can move on to the next step. 2. Jack Up CarIt?s very important that your car is level to get the oil drained completely. You can do this by using a floor jack, and some jack stands. If your vehicle is already pretty far off of the ground, you might be able to get underneath and perform the replacement without jacking it up.Otherwise, jack up your car and secure it on stands. Make sure you place the stands in the appropriate place based on manufacturer recommendations. 3. Drain OilBefore you go any further, you must drain out the old oil from the pan. Place a drain pan under the plug and pull it out. You will need a socket to remove this plug in most cases. Turn the plug until it?s loose and remove it by hand. Put the plug in a safe place unless you plan on replacing it. 4. Take Off Old PanAfter the oil has been drained, you are able to take off the old pan. The steps to do this may vary by vehicle.Find the bolts holding it on and loosen them. Take a rag and clean off the area where the old pan is attached to the engine block. You will probably find a good amount of debris on these surfaces, including some metal shards. 5. Replace with New PanBefore you put the new pan on, run your sealant around the surface, so you can attach the new gasket. Once the gasket is in place, you can put on a new pan.Put the bolts back in place and make sure everything is tightened to spec. Do not overtighten the screws or you can strip the holes. 6. Replace Oil & FilterWhile you are performing an oil change, you might as well install a new oil filter too. Screw the filter in place.After that, fill the engine back up with the right type of oil. Make sure you check the levels after you bring the car down off of the jacks. Also, check for any leaks in the system before you start driving. 7. Consult a Mechanic for More HelpIf any part of this repair makes you uncomfortable, you should talk to a mechanic. While this can be a simple task, it?s not meant for everyone.It?s best to pay the labor fee to have a professional perform the installation than to break something in the process. Even stripping a bolt can lead to a world of trouble."
Is Replacing An Oil Pan Easy?	"Replacing the oil pan is fairly simple and straightforward in most car models and can be done with some basic mechanic skills, with the help of a repair manual. However, in some car models, you have to lift the engine to remove the oil pan, and in that case it is much more difficult."
Can I drive a car with an oil pan leak?	"Although you can drive a car with a leaking oil pan, it is not recommended for many reasons. First of all, when the car engine leaks oil, it can result in a low engine oil level that can damage your engine. It is also bad for the environment and also a safety hazard for other cars, due to the fact that oil on the road can be very slippery."
How Long Does It Take To Replace The Oil Pan?	"It usually takes between 2 and 4 hours for a professional mechanic to replace an oil pan. In some car models, changing the oil pan is much more difficult and you may have to lift the engine, which will greatly increase the change time."
How often should an oil pan be replaced?	"There is no set schedule for when the oil pan should be replaced. The oil pan is usually replaced when it starts to leak or when it is very rusty or corroded, depending on whether your car model has a steel or aluminum oil pan."
Conclusion	"You can expect to pay between $250 and $1,000 if you have the oil pan replaced by a professional. However, in some car models, you may need to lift or remove the engine to replace the oil pan, and in this case, it will cost much more. Luckily it?s just in a few car models.Replacing the oil pan yourself is not a difficult task in most car models, and you can save a lot of money by doing it with some basic mechanic skills. You may only need to buy a new oil pan for $150 to $500, and if you can install it for free, it will be quite cheap."
Do Teslas Need Oil Changes?	"No, Teslas don?t require oil changes, because Teslas are powered by electric motors and don?t use a gas or diesel-powered engine, and therefore there is no engine oil to change. While regular oil changes aren?t necessary, Tesla still has a list of recommended maintenance that should be performed to keep the electric car running at its best."
Why Doesn?t a Tesla Need an Oil Change?	"The equipment powering the Tesla and propelling it forward is based on an electric motor. Unlike the traditional motor types, using gasoline or diesel fuel, there?s no oil needed. Instead, the Tesla motor utilizes electricity to generate its power. In a traditional car, the fuel is burned to start and run the engine. With an EV, an electric charge is all that?s needed to keep everything running as intended. If the vehicle isn?t charged, it won?t run or start. With that said, there are other parts of the vehicle that require the use of certain oils and lubricants. As one example, the drive unit with the AC induction propulsion motor requires oil. However, this oil doesn?t normally need to be checked or changed until the car has been driven for 100,000 miles. Additionally, the gearbox in the Tesla also requires a certain type of oil. Tesla recommends replacing this oil during the first, fifth, and ninth year of ownership. If you don?t have this oil change, the gearbox might start to fail, causing problems with the drivability. "
What Fluids Do Tesla Cars Need?	"1. Brake FluidWhile the braking system of a Tesla is slightly different, Tesla still has brake fluid. However, because of the regenerative braking system, the brake fluid doesn?t wear out as fast. For this reason, Tesla normally recommends checking the quality of the brake fluid every year or two just to ensure everything looks normal. Contaminated fluid will reduce efficiency and create a dangerous situation in traffic. 2. Transmission FluidWe briefly touched on the importance of transmission fluid in the Tesla. Even though the EV uses a different type of transmission, gearbox fluid is still required in a Tesla.You want to be careful to use the right type of fluid. Plus, it only needs to be replaced every 12,500 miles.3. Windshield Washer FluidJust like a traditional combustion car, the Tesla is going to need windshield washer fluid. Both types of vehicles have auto glass that needs to be kept clean for maximum visibility.Adding windshield washer fluid is just as easy in the Tesla and can often be done on your own. Pop open the hood and access the maintenance panel. From here, you should see the reservoir that needs to be filled up. Considering the cost of windshield washer fluid, there?s no reason to put off this necessary task whenever it gets low. 4. CoolantThe coolant used in the Tesla varies slightly and it?s needed for different reasons. Tesla models use G48 coolant, which is required to keep the battery cells from getting too hot. It?s an ethylene glycol-based fluid that is blue-green colored.It doesn?t just help to regulate the temperature in the battery cells but also prevents corrosion. It?s best to choose a G48 that utilizes organic corrosion inhibitors and specifically lists Tesla as an approved make. 5. GreaseWhile grease isn?t technically a liquid, it?s still worth mentioning. Tesla vehicles use grease in multiple areas, to prolong the lifespan of specific parts.You will find grease on the handles, latches, hinges, drive axle and windshield wiper. With grease, these parts remain lubricated and efficient. "
Recommended Tesla Maintenance Schedule	"1. Replace Cabin Air FilterJust like a regular car, your Tesla contains a cabin air filter. This filter is responsible for removing contaminants that could cause allergies and respiratory ailments. It will trap pollen, road pollution and more, ensuring that none of these harmful contaminants get into the cabin. Depending on what type of Tesla you drive, there are different recommendations for when the cabin air filter should be changed. With the Model 3 and Model Y, Tesla recommends cabin air filter replacement every two years. Otherwise, the Model S and Model X are scheduled every three years. However, if your Model S or Model X was produced between 2012 and 2020, the recommendation goes back to two years.2. Replace High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) FilterSome Tesla models are equipped with a high efficiency particulate air filter, otherwise known as the HEPA filter. These advanced filters are designed to keep even more particles from getting into the cabin.If your Tesla comes equipped with a HEPA filter, it?s recommended that you change it every three years. Of course, some people prefer to replace them more often, especially if you tend to drive more than the average person. 3. Air Conditioning ServiceTesla vehicles require regular air conditioning service to ensure longevity. The AC desiccant bag needs to be replaced at regular intervals. Here are the general guidelines set out by the manufacturer.Model 3: Replace AC desiccant bag every six yearsModel Y: Replace AC desiccant bag every four yearsModel S/Model X: Replace AC desiccant bag every three yearsThere are several exceptions to these general rules. If your Model S or Model X was produced from 2012 to 2020, the AC desiccant bag needs to be replaced every four years.There could also be times when the refrigerant needs to be recharged, although this typically only occurs if there?s a problem. If it needs a recharge, it?s best to visit a professional, as different formulations are required based on the model you drive. 4. Tire Rotation, Balance and Wheel AlignmentYour Tesla vehicle also has tires, similar to your traditional automobile. You still have to take care of these tires if you want to maximize on-road safety. According to Tesla, the tires should be rotated every 6,250 miles. If the tread depth varies by 2/32 or more among the tires, it?s also wise to rotate them.If you drive aggressively, the tire wear could occur much faster. Additionally, you want to consider regular balancing and wheel alignment to ensure that the ride remains comfortable. 5. Winterize Services If you drive your Tesla in an area that experiences winter weather, you will need to take some special precautions. For starters, there?s a chance you might need to upgrade your tires for better traction. Additionally, Tesla recommends lubricating and cleaning the brake calipers frequently for cars that drive in colder climates. The recommendation is 12 months or every 12,500 months to ensure the winter weather doesn?t cause rust or freezing of the calipers. "
What Happens If I Put Too Much Oil in my Car?	"If you add too much oil to your car engine, the crankshaft can hit the oil and foam the oil, resulting in engine damage. Fortunately, no action is needed if the oil level is only slightly above. However, if you overfill it 0.2? or more above the MAX mark, you may need to drain some of the oil.The engine oil reserve holds some extra oil to compensate for the fluid expansion due to hot conditions. Adding an extra half a quart will not damage your engine. However, anything more than that could be harmful to the engine.When you add too much oil, the excess oil will go towards the crankshaft, and as the crankshaft rotates at a high-speed, the oil is mixed with the air and ?aerates? or becomes foamy. This foamy texture of the oil acts like a bad lubricant, and the oil is not pumped effectively. Over time, the engine will be starved of proper lubrication, and due to the weak oil pump, it can get locked up."
what are The Effects Of put  Too Much Car Oil in my car ?	"Overfilling your car?s engine oil can cause some of the following consequences:Foamed Engine Oil ? If the oil level in the oil pan gets too high, the crankshaft will rotate in the oil, causing the oil to foam. Foamed motor oil is harmful to your engine because it pushes air bubbles through the engine.Combusted Oil ? If the oil is overfilled, it will cause higher crankcase pressure, resulting in oil being pushed into the combustion chambers. You may notice blue smoke from the exhaust.Spark plug fouling ? When the oil gets into the combustion chamber, it will cause a thin layer of oil on the spark plugs. This will cause fouling spark plugs, which will result in a misfiring engine.Failing seals and gaskets ? Overfilled engine oil will cause higher pressure in the crankcase as we discussed earlier. Higher pressure in the crankcase can lead to failing gaskets or seals, so if you notice more oil leaks than usual, it could be due to overfilled oil."
What Are The Symptoms of Overfilled Engine Oil?	"The most common sign that you have put too much oil in your engine and that the oil level is too high is that your engine starts to leak oil onto the ground, or you see blue smoke from the exhaust. It can also cause a warning light on your dashboard.Sometimes, you might not know if you or the mechanic have overfilled your engine oil. However, if you notice any of these symptoms, there may be a risk that your oil is overfilled:Oil leakageA burning smell of engine oilSigns of smoke from the engine baySigns of smoke from the exhaust areaThe engine is making too much noiseEngine Oil Pressure Light on the dashboard"
How Much Is Too Much Oil In my Car?	"If you want to be on the safe side, anything above the MAX mark on the dipstick is too much. However, if you overfilled the oil by half a quart or less, there is usually nothing to worry about. If the oil level is 0.2? or more above the max mark on the dipstick or you see foam on it, it?s time to drain some oil though.How much oil you can add before it reaches critical levels for the engine depends on the engine type. Typically, older engines are less sensitive to higher oil levels, so if you have a modern engine, you?ll want to be careful about overfilling it."
How To Fix Overfilled Oil?	"To fix overfilled oil, you need to drain the engine oil. There are two main methods of getting oil out of the engine and these are to either use a suction pump or drain it through the oil plug. Draining it through the oil plug is the easiest way, as it usually doesn?t require any special tools.The advantage of using a suction pump to get the oil out is that you don?t have to raise the car and crawl under it. But you need a special pump and an air supply for it, and most people don?t want to spend money on a tool they will only use once or twice.The most common method is to drain it the traditional way through the oil plug. If you are not used to cars this can be a bit messy and sometimes difficult so you may want to have a mechanic do it if you are unsure. Here is how you can drain the oil through the oil plug:Raise the car and place jacks under it for safetyRemove the cover under the engine if present.Locate the oil plug (Use a repair manual to locate it if unsure)Remove the drain plug and drain it into a bucket with the amount you think you overfilled it with (usually 1 quart).Replace the oil plug and tighten it to specification.Refit the cover, and lower the vehicle to the ground.Start the engine for 3 minutes and turn it off.Wait 5 minutes and check the oil level again."
why my car have High Oil Level Without Overfilling ?	"If you noticed that your engine oil level is above the max mark, but you are absolutely sure that neither you nor your mechanic overfilled the oil, there is actually another explanation for this problem.If you only drive short distances and never allow the engine oil to warm up properly, it will eventually fill it with gasoline that will not evaporate unless it reaches a higher temperature. This will cause the oil level to rise over time and can actually be harmful to the engine as well.However, if you notice that the oil level is too high because of gasoline in the oil, the best way is still to get an oil change done and try to drive the car for longer trips in the future to prevent this problem."
Can I Drive a Car With Too Much Oil?	No. You shouldn?t drive a car with too much oil. Too much oil can cause it to foam which causes air bubbles to enter the oil pressure channels inside the engine; this is bad for the engine and can cause it to seize if you are unlucky. But if you only overfilled it slightly ? 0.2? or less below the max mark ? you don?t need to worry too much in most cases.
How Long Can I Run My Car With Too Much Oil?	"In most cases, you should not drive your car at all if you put too much oil in it. However, how long you can drive your car with too much oil depends on how much you overfilled it. If you overfilled it by just 0.2? or less above the max mark on the dipstick, you don?t need to worry too much. If you overfilled more than that, it?s best to drain the oil as soon as possible."
Will an Extra Quart of Oil Damage My Engine?	"Yes. Just one extra quart of oil can damage your engine if you?re unlucky, depending on the engine type. Some engines are more sensitive than others to too much oil. This depends on the distance between the crankshaft and the oil pan. However, it is best not to take the risk even with just an extra quart of oil, as it is quite easy to drain it."
Will 1 Liter of Extra Oil Hurt My Engine?	"Yes. Even one extra liter of oil can damage your engine, depending on the engine type. Due to the risk of engine damage with too much oil, it is better not to take the risk and drain the oil instead. If you overfill it by half a liter it is quite safe in most engines, but 1 liter is usually too much."
What Happens If The Oil Level is Above Max?	"If the oil level is only slightly above the max, like 0.2? or less, most likely nothing will happen, depending on the engine. However, if you fill the oil too much above the max mark, the crankshaft will hit the oil level and foam up the engine oil, which can damage the engine."
Can Too Much Oil Cause Engine Noise?	Yes. Too much oil can cause the crankshaft to hit the oil level and foam up the engine oil. Foamed engine oil can cause air bubbles to pass through the oil pump into the hydraulic lifters and other necessary parts of the engine. This can cause the lifters to malfunction and cause a ticking noise from the lifter.
How Much Engine Oil Should I Fill In My Car?	"To determine how much oil your engine needs, you need to check it in the owner?s manual. Most engines require 3 to 8 quarts of oil, but this varies by engine size. For example, a 4-cylinder engine may require 3 to 4 quarts of oil, while a larger 6-cylinder engine may need around 6 quarts of oil."
Can Overfilled Engine Oil Blow The Head Gasket?	"No. Too much engine oil will not cause a blown head gasket in most cases. However, overfilled engine oil can cause oil leaks which cause smoke to come from the engine bay or the exhaust, which is quite similar to the symptoms of a bad head gasket."
Will Excess Oil Burn Off?	"Excess oil will eventually burn off, depending on the engine type, as some engines burn more oil than others. However, overfilling engine oil can damage the engine, and if you?re unlucky, it can damage the engine before the excess oil burns off. Therefore, it is better to drain the oil instead of waiting for it to burn off."
Conclusion	"If you put too much oil in your engine, it can result in foamed engine oil which can lead to serious engine damage. You need to drain it in most car models if it?s 0.2? above the MAX sign on the dipstick, but it?s better to be safe than sorry.Overfilling your engine oil may seem like a small mistake, but in reality it can have serious consequences for your engine. Therefore, while some engines can handle the overfilled engine oil well, it?s really not worth the risk.Driving with too much oil can cause complete engine failure. You may end up needing a total engine replacement, which is definitely not cheap. If you?ve overfilled the oil, it?s cheap insurance to drain some oil, even if it?s not a fun job. You can either drain the oil with a suction pump or drain it through the oil plug.I hope this article helped answer the questions you had about overfilling engine oil, and that you now have the knowledge of what to do if you overfill the oil in the future."
5w30 Vs 10w30 Differences in Engine Oil Viscosity	"Wondering what the difference is between 5w30 and 10w30 engine oil? Can you mix them together? And if so, what are the benefits? Let's take a look5W30 Vs 10W30 DifferencesWhen it comes to changing and topping off the motor oil, consumers are regularly confused about what viscosity to use. With so many options on the market, it?s tough figuring out what?s best to use. For example, can you put 10w30 in a 5w30 engine? In this guide, we examine the main differences between the two motor oils and discuss how to read the motor oil ratings. We also look at if it?s okay to mix the two viscosities and describe what?s going to happen if you switch out the type"
Is It Okay to Mix 10w30 and 5w30 Motor Oil?	"In general, it?s considered safe to use 10w30 and 5w30 interchangeably as long as you follow the manufacturer?s oil specifications. There are some minor differences, but nothing that?s going to cause a major problem in most vehicles. However, it?s still best to follow specification recommendations whenever possible.What do you do if you are topping off the oil and you only have the other one available? Should you put the two together or would it be best to drain the old oil out first? Honestly, there?s nothing stopping you from putting a little of the other oil in with what?s already in there.In most situations, it?s fine to mix oils as long as they both match the specifications of what?s recommended by the car manufacturer. For this reason, it?s best to read your owner?s manual before proceeding.What?s more important is that there?s enough oil in the system. You don?t want to leave the engine low because you don?t have the precise formula on hand. Oil levels should always fall between the Empty and Full markings on the dipstick. If not, go ahead and top it off. "
Differences Between 10w30 and 5w30 ?	"1. ViscosityThe Society of Automotive Engineers determines the viscosity ratings of motor oil. Both 10w30 and 5w30 have different viscosity ratings. Considering that the W in the rating stands for winter, we can see that 5w30 is going to have a lower viscosity rating than the 10w30. It?s considered a thinner oil when operating at lower temperatures.However, both of these oils feature the same viscosity rating in warmer temperatures and conditions. With that said, neither of these is going to make a big difference under normal conditions. You shouldn?t see that drastic of an issue when using them interchangeably. 2. PerformanceBecause of the viscosity rating, you can anticipate the engine performance with either. Both 5w30 and 10w30 feature a similar SAE rating, proving that they will perform equally once the engine reaches normal operating temperatures. However, 10w30 is going to thicken up more when used in colder weather. For this reason, 5w30 is going to be more suitable in some colder climates, although there?s not much difference in most situations. 3. LubricationThe 5w30 is going to provide enough lubrication for most passenger vehicles. There?s no reason to use a thicker oil in most situations. However, 10w30 is thicker before the engine reaches normal temperatures. For this reason, it might provide better lubrication for commercial vehicles or anything with a heavy-duty engine. 4. Ideal EnvironmentWhere you live and the conditions in which you drive your car have a profound effect on what oil you need to use. Both 5w30 and 10w30 are considered multi-grade oil. If you live in a region with sub-zero temperatures, you want to use the 5w30. It?s going to perform better in the winter than 10w30, although both operate the same once the engine is warmed up. On the flip side, 10w30 flows the best when temperatures reach triple digits in the southern states. "
How to Read Motor Oil Ratings ?	"Let?s dive deeper into how to read the oil ratings set by the SAE. For starters, we want to look at the number that occurs before the W. We already covered that the W stands for winter. This number before the W shows how well the oil flows when used in lower temperatures. If you live in a cold-weather climate, both the 5W and 10W oil are going to be a good option for you. However, the 5w oil will flow slightly better at first if temperatures are cold.10w30 is recommended as long as the minimum outside temperature is above 0øF. If your area hits lower temperatures during the winter months, you?ll want to swap it out for 5w30. Now, let?s deal with the number that comes after the W. This figure reveals the thickness of the oil at normal operating temperatures. In both of these cases, you see that the oil will perform the same once the engine is warmed up. However, there are other motor oil options that provide different operating viscosities, but you don?t want to use these if they aren?t recommended for your vehicle. "
What Happens if I Use 10w30 Instead of 5w30?	"If you put 10w30 oil in the engine instead of 5w30, you probably aren?t going to notice a difference in most circumstances. The only difference is that the engine is slightly less protected from wear when you start the engine in extremely cold temperatures.Both operate the same once the engine is warm, so there?s very little to worry about unless you are living somewhere with extreme cold.The thicker oil isn?t going to flow as quickly through the engine at first. For this reason, 5w30 could provide better fuel economy at first, but the results will be so minimal you probably won?t notice them. As mentioned above, once the engine is warmed up, the oils will work the same, so fuel economy is no longer an issue. "
Should Higher Oil Viscosity Be Used in High-mileage Engines?	"It wasn?t long ago that engines were built to include looser tolerance. This condition was especially noticeable with the bearing clearances. As the engine hit 100,000 miles, it would begin to deteriorate. To prevent wear, owners would regularly switch to higher oil viscosity, sometimes 10w40 or 20w50. When they did this, the oil pump and engine had to work much harder to pump the oil and maintain proper pressure. While the thicker oil might offer more lubrication, car owners were sacrificing horsepower to protect it. Thankfully, this isn?t necessarily the case today.With the modern car engine, you can easily get to 300,000 miles or more without any engine problems. The oil and circulation issues that happened years ago have been fixed with high-tech designs. There are also tighter clearances in today?s engines. For this reason, it?s no longer necessary to switch oil viscosity as the engine ages. On the other hand, switching to a higher viscosity than what?s recommended can cause more damage today than any good it might provide. It could lead to permanent engine wear. If you do start to notice trouble with leaking or burning oil, there are other options. You could switch to a high-mileage oil formulation, as long as it?s in the recommended viscosity. These commercially-made oils have special additives meant for the aging engine. There are also additives that will help to lubricate the seals and stop those pesky little leaks."
Is 5W30 or 10w30 better for summer?	"There is no reason to switch between 5W30 and 10W30 between winter and summer. Both have the same viscosity at higher temperatures, but 5W30 is slightly thinner than 10W30 at cold temperatures. 10W30 is preferred in warmer climates, but you should still follow the manufacturer?s recommendations."
Is 10w30 better for high mileage?	"10W30 oil can be good for a high-mileage engine. However, there are many more factors to consider before, and it is best to follow the manufacturer?s recommendations. However, many people prefer to use even thicker motor oils than 10W30 in high mileage engines."
Is 10w30 thicker than 5W-30 in summer?	"No, at high temperatures there is no difference between 10w30 and 5w30. The number 30 is the higher temperature rating, and the 10 and 5 are the cold temperature viscosity. Therefore, 10w30 is thicker at colder temperatures."
Is 10w30 or 5W-30 better for winter?	"5W30 oil is preferred for winters in very cold climates due to the lower viscosity at low temperatures. However, there is no reason to switch between them during summer and winter. Always follow the manufacturer?s recommendations."
what are the Causes of Check Engine Light After Oil Change ?	"Most often, the Check Engine Light comes on after an oil change because the dipstick isn?t seated correctly or the oil fill cap is on backward. Otherwise, it could be due to low oil pressure, too much oil in the system, the wrong oil being used, or the sensor didn?t reset. Below is a little more detailed information about each of the possible reasons why your car?s check engine light comes on after an oil change.1. Dipstick isn?t Seated CorrectlyThe dipstick is needed to check the oil level in the engine. You remove the dipstick, you clean it off and you put it back in. This process is also part of the regular oil change. When done correctly, the dipstick will sit perfectly in its tube. With this design, the O-ring ensures that the system is sealed. However, if the dipstick isn?t put back in just right, air can get into the engine through the tube. Not only can this problem lead to damage to vital engine components over time, but it will cause the Check Engine Light to come on. 2. Oil Fill Cap is installed incorrectlyJust as important as checking the location of the dipstick, you must also care about how the oil fill cap is put back on. After you changed the oil, you may not have put the oil fill cap back on correctly. Just like putting the gas cap back on, not everyone thinks about how it should be placed. In some cases, it?s possible to put it on backward or not thread it back on all of the way. With either option, the system will notice that there?s an imbalance of air getting into the system and the Check Engine Light might come on. 3. Low Oil PressureChanging the oil itself isn?t going to lead to low oil pressure. However, what could happen is that the system takes a second to realize that there?s enough pressure after the change. When the oil has been drained and the oil pressure gauge resets, it could take time before it reads the new pressures. The Check Engine Light could come on temporarily during this analysis by the system. 4. Too Much OilYou must use the right amount of oil in the engine when you replace it. If you put too much into the system, the Check Engine Light is going to come on. You could also notice some misfiring or a sluggish engine.In some cases, too much oil can also lead to a smoky exhaust. This smoke comes from the oil burning off through the exhaust. In the worst cases, the engine won?t start at all. 5. Wrong OilAll vehicles are required to use a particular type of oil for the engine to run its best. If you choose to use a different weight or viscosity, it can cause a lot of trouble for your vehicle. One of the most common mistakes is using 10W-30 when the vehicle needs 5W-30. Oil that is excessively viscous doesn?t provide the same amount of lubrication, ensuring that heat isn?t transferred the way it should be. With this problem, the oil is going to heat up faster and your Check Engine Light is going to come on. 6. Sensor Didn?t ResetIf the Check Engine Light is on to alert you to the service that?s needed, an oil change will automatically shut it off when the sensor is reset. However, not all cars have a sensor that resets on its own. If the sensor doesn?t reset, you might still see the Check Engine Light or Service Engine warning. Without the ability to manually reset this light, it will remain on. "
How to Fix Check Engine Light After Oil Change ?	"1. Check DipstickIf you think the problem stems from the dipstick sitting in the wrong position, you have a simple fix on your hands. Open up the hood and take a look at the dipstick.If it?s not in the tube correctly, make the necessary adjustments to get it seated. You should also look down into the tube to make sure debris isn?t stopping the stick from getting into place. 2. Check Oil Filler CapJust like with the gas cap after filling up with fuel, it?s easy to keep the oil filler cap off slightly or in the wrong position. To fix this, you simply have to look at the cap to see how it is placed.If it?s on backward or doesn?t seem to fit correctly, try again. You can also look in your service manual to find the appropriate way to put on the cap if you aren?t sure, but many cars only allow it to go on one way. 3. Run Engine for a Few MinutesIf the problem seems to be low oil pressure, you might only need a few minutes to resolve the issue. Run the engine for a few minutes to see if the system figures out the pressures on its own.As the new oil circulates through the system, the Check Engine Light should go off. If it doesn?t, there?s something larger going on. If it was a temporarily low oil pressure, you might need to reset the check engine light with an OBD2 scanner, and it may solve the warning light.4. Remove Excess OilIf the oil was overfilled, the only option you have is to remove some. You can use a suction pump to drain out some of the oil. Some people prefer to perform this process through the dipstick tube, while others will use the cap access point. Do your research first to determine if an automatic or manual pump will work better for you. 5. Use Appropriate OilIf you used the wrong oil and are having trouble, you might need to perform a new oil change with the right viscosity. Drain the oil and start over with the oil recommended in the owner?s manual.With this oil change, you must also replace the filter again. Once that is done, the Check Engine Light should turn off. 6. Reset CodesIf the sensor doesn?t turn itself off, the Check Engine Light could remain on after an oil change. However, you can reset this sensor yourself. To start, get your code scanner and plug it in under the driver?s side of the dashboard. Turn on the device and scan for trouble codes. If there are no codes pointing to another problem, you can clear the codes with your scanner. Once that is complete, the light should go off once you restart the vehicle. Take the car for a test drive to ensure the light remains off. If it comes back, it?s time to have a professional look at the system to figure out what?s wrong. "
what are the Causes of Low Oil Pressure at Idle ?	"Most commonly, low oil pressure means that the oil level is low, especially when it happens at idle. It could also mean that the oil quality is poor, you have a clogged oil filter, the oil pump is defective, the oil pressure gauge could be faulty, or you might be using the wrong grade of oil for your car or the weather. 1. Low OilIf the oil level dips too low, it can cause a change in pressure when the engine is idling. The pump can?t work with the right amount of oil when it gets too low. With this issue, you might also notice the oil pressure dips during turns at higher speeds since the oil is moving from side to side, away from the sensors.Low oil levels can be a simple oversight, while other times, it can be due to a mechanical problem. You need to know what?s causing it if you want to fix it. 2. Poor Oil QualityIf you hadn?t changed the oil in the engine when you were supposed to, it could affect the pressure. As the oil becomes contaminated and dirty, it loses many of its original properties. The oil structure changes, leading to a loss of pressure. Its efficacy will also diminish, and it won?t be able to clean and protect the engine the way it should. 3. Defective Oil PumpThe oil pump is a necessary component that keeps engine oil circulating in the system. When it fails, it can no longer pump the oil through the engine.The oil indicator can start to flash, showing that the pump has gone bad. When this happens, it?s important to have it checked immediately before engine damage occurs. 4. Clogged oil filterIf you have not changed the oil filter for a long time, it can actually be clogged with sludge and it will reduce the flow and lead to low oil pressure in the engine. Replacing an oil filter is often very simple, and you should always replace the oil filter when performing an oil change on your car.5. Faulty Pressure GaugeIf you notice low oil pressure occurring at idle, the pressure gauge itself might be faulty. This can occur right after an oil change until the system falls back in line and registers the new viscosity. However, if it goes beyond that, you need to have the gauge checked and the electrical system looked at. It could be another issue leading to a faulty reading. 6. Wrong Oil GradeIf you used the wrong type of oil in the engine during the last change, it could cause pressure problems. While some engines can use multiple grades of engine oil, there are a few that require a very specific formulation. If the oil is too thin or thick, it won?t flow through the engine properly. Plus, the motor won?t get the lubrication it needs. 7. Damaged EngineThe worst-case scenario is that the engine itself is damaged. While this isn?t something you want to deal with, it can happen ? especially if you haven?t maintained it properly. If all of the other situations don?t seem to be causing the problem, it?s time to examine what other symptoms the motor is experiencing. You can read the trouble codes, evaluate the performance and watch the fuel economy to get a better picture of what?s going on inside the motor. "
How to Repair Low Oil Pressure at Idle ?	"1. Add More OilIf the oil level in the engine is low, the only solution is to add the right amount. Use the oil dipstick to monitor where it is currently at.If you notice that it?s too far down on the dipstick, it?s time to add more. Make sure that the oil viscosity matches what?s in there and that the quality is in good shape. You don?t want to add an abundance of fresh oil to dirty oil, as this simply degrades what you are adding. 2. Perform Oil & Oil filter ChangeIf the engine oil is contaminated and dirty, the oil pressure might not be accurate because the viscosity changes. When it comes time to change the oil, go ahead and perform this vital maintenance step.After the oil change, you should notice that the pressure regulates better. If not, the problem could be something else on this list. However, this is one of the cheaper fixes you can work with, so it?s best to start here. 3. Replace Oil PumpIf the oil pump is bad, your only option is to replace it. However, this repair can have varying costs, depending on what type of vehicle you drive.On average, an oil pump replacement might cost $350 to $2,000. Considering most of this cost is the labor involved, you could save some money if you can do the job yourself. 4. Repair The Pressure GaugeIf the gauge is erratic and unpredictable, there could be an electrical problem or sensor issue. This would be especially true if you aren?t noticing engine performance issues.To repair the gauge, you must first determine what part is failing. It could be the gauge itself or one of the sensors, both of which require professional diagnostics to determine. 5. Use The Right OilIf you think that the wrong oil viscosity was used in the engine, you need to replace it. Start by looking in the owner?s manual to determine exactly what you should have used. If that doesn?t give you the information you need, reach out to your local dealership or mechanic for more advice.Once you know what oil to use, it?s time to change it. Don?t forget to also change the oil filter to ensure none of the old fluid remains in the system. 6. Have The Engine FixedThere are some engine issues that could be fixed. However, if the motor is severely damaged, you are looking at some hefty bills to repair it. To prevent this problem, it?s best to keep up with the motor maintenance, which is far cheaper than replacing an engine.With that said, you have several options when it comes to replacing an engine. The cheapest is normally to have a used engine put in. These engines can be found at the salvage yard but normally don?t have any guarantees. You can also have the engine rebuilt. If you choose this option, the mechanic will dismantle your motor and rebuild it with better parts for smoother operation. There?s also the option to get a remanufactured engine. Your old engine is removed and replaced with one that has already been restored with newer parts. With this type of engine, you often get some type of guarantee on the engine and labor. However, the most reliable way to fix the problem is to get a new crate engine installed. This new motor is the most expensive option, often costing $4,000 to $10,000 or more, depending on the type of vehicle you drive."
How to Check my  Car?s Engine Oil ?	"Before you check the engine oil, you need to gather your supplies and prepare the vehicle. In some cases, the engine needs to be warm, while other times it should be cold. Pull out the dipstick and clean it off. Put it back in and pull it out to read it again. Make any adjustments as indicated.1.Prepare Supplies/CarPaper TowelBefore you get started, you want to get all of your supplies together. You will need a paper towel or clean rag. Aside from that, checking the oil level doesn?t require special tools or extensive expertise. You also want to park the car on level ground so you get an accurate reading. Check the owner?s manual to see if the engine should be warm or cold, as different manufacturers recommend varying instructions. If it should be cold, wait 15 minutes after running the engine. If it should be warm, just run the engine for a few minutes. Either way, you should turn the engine off to read the oil levels. 2.Pull DipstickEngine Oil DipstickPop open the hood and find the dipstick. It should have an orange, yellow or red tab at the end. If you can?t find it, reference the owner?s manual. Some modern vehicles don?t allow for physical checks because it?s all done electronically instead.Take out the dipstick. While you will be tempted to read the oil level and examine the condition now, it?s not going to be accurate. Check your owner?s manual to find the engine oil dipstick, so you don?t check the transmission fluid level, as these dipsticks can be quite similar looking.3.Clean DipstickClean Oil DipstickWipe the dipstick clean, working from the handle down to the tip. Use your paper towel or clean rag to clean it off. Once the dipstick is cleaned off, you need to put it back in place. Make sure it?s pushed all of the way back in and is secure. Wait a few seconds before moving on. 4.Read Dipstick Level & ConditionDipstick Oil LevelPull the dipstick out once again, but this time to read the oil level. The dipstick contains indicators on the low and full end to show you how much oil is in the system. Not only should you take note of how full the oil is, but you should also look at the condition. We will discuss more about that in one minute. 5.Make Adjustments as NeededFill Engine OilIf there?s not enough oil in the engine, you need to add more. Once you top off the oil, you need to check the level once again. If the engine is too full, you need to remove some oil through the drain plug with the help of an oil pan. Also, if the oil is dirty or contaminated, you need to change it. Don?t add new oil to contaminated oil. It won?t give you the results you desire. Put the dipstick back in place and secure it in the tube. When you are all done, make sure you close the hood and check that it is latched. "
What if the Car Has No Dipstick?	"Back in the day, every car came with an oil dipstick, so this might be hard to imagine if you haven?t driven a newer model. However, today?s cars are changing the way things are happening. Many new models have gotten rid of the dipstick to make things easier to monitor.The Toyota Supra, some Volkswagens and a few Audis have this feature. However, Mazda, Chrysler, Chevy, Lincoln and Ford are also rolling it out with select models. In some cases, it?s completely understandable why there?s no dipstick, such as with the Porsche Cayman. After all, the Cayman?s engine top can only be reached by going through the cabin. In this case, we understand why the automaker wouldn?t want average users checking the oil levels while sitting in the high-end interior. However, automakers haven?t left drivers without a way to watch oil levels. Instead of the dipstick, there are advanced systems that involve sensors to monitor oil levels. These sensors are needed to monitor levels with the engine computer. With this system, you can?t physically look at the oil level, but there will be an indicator when it gets too low. A warning light should come on to alert you to the problem. So far, the systems have been incredibly reliable. That doesn?t mean that failure is impossible. If the advanced system fails to notify users that the oil is low, engine damage could occur. Hopefully, the car is under warranty if this happens. Otherwise, you will have a large repair bill to contend with. Still, it?s not necessary to choose your next car based on whether it has a dipstick or not. It?s just a matter of rolling with the changes and learning how to adapt. "
What Does Engine Oil Color Mean ?	"1. AmberIf you pull out the dipstick and notice this amber color, you are in good shape. This is exactly what color you want to see. When oil is fresh, it looks amber-colored. It should also be clear, indicating that you don?t need to change the oil. 2. Dark Brown/BlackWhen the oil is darkened, there are several issues that could be happening. If the oil is newer, it might just appear dark because of the additives you are using. You don?t want to automatically change it, assuming that it is dirty.However, dark oil can also mean it?s contaminated or dirty. In this case, it will also be thickened. When the oil is dark brown, you might still be able to get a little more time out of it. However, there?s no more time to wait once it turns black. If you get close to the oil dipstick, it could also give off a burning smell. 3. Milky White/CreamYour heart might sink when you initially see milky white or creamy-looking oil on the dipstick. It?s true that this could be a really bad sign, but let?s not jump to conclusions. For starters, it could just mean that there?s an excessive amount of condensation occurring. If the coolant level isn?t changing and there?s no white smoke coming from the exhaust, this is likely the explanation."
How Often Should Engine Oil be Checked ?	"The engine oil condition and level should be checked much more frequently than the typical change. On average, it?s recommended to pull the dipstick every month or more often. By doing this, you will start to get into a routine, noticing how long it takes for the oil to become contaminated. It should help you better understand the life cycle of the engine oil."
What Color Should Oil Be On Dipstick?	"Engine oil can appear in multiple shades of amber, based on what type you are using and how old your vehicle is. Depending on what additives you use, the oil could be a little darker and may darken faster. Still, immediately following an oil change, it should remain amber for a good amount of time.Over time, motor oil absorbs combustion by-products that lead to contamination. The longer you go without an oil change, the darker the oil becomes. The fact that it becomes darker shows that it?s doing exactly what it?s supposed to. However, if you have a diesel engine, the engine oil can become black quite fast after an oil change, so with diesel engines, it?s better to follow the maintenance schedule. This guide is better suited for gas engines."
what are the Dipstick Oil Color Chart  ?	"1. AmberAs we?ve discussed, amber-colored motor oil is perfectly normal. In fact, this is the color you want it to be. The best oil looks the same color as when you put it in the engine. The closer it is to that color, the better.If you see amber oil on the dipstick, you are safe to keep driving for a while yet. However, you will want to continue checking it to ensure nothing is changing. 2. Dark Brown/BlackWhen the engine oil gets dark brown or black, it could be normal, or there could be something wrong. Most likely, it?s time to change the oil. As the dirt builds up in the oil, it gets darker and thicker. However, if the engine oil is darker but thin, it could be normal. Depending on what additives you are using, the color could be slightly darkened. If the oil isn?t clinging to the dipstick, chances are everything is fine and you can continue driving.3. Cream/MilkyIf the oil is frothy and milky-looking, you have some issues to deal with immediately. In most cases, this oil type indicates that the head gasket has blown, allowing coolant to leak into the oil. To repair this, you have an expensive repair bill ahead of you.You may also notice a creamy buildup on the oil filler cap. Additionally, it can cause white smoke to come from the exhaust and the engine could overheat. Don?t prolong getting the problem repaired, or you could end up with even larger repair bills.There?s a slim chance that the creamy oil isn?t a head gasket failure. If the oil was accidentally contaminated by water, you could change the oil and the problem should cease. 4. RustIf you own an older vehicle or live in an environment that is excessively humid, you may notice the engine oil turns a rust color. The humidity can allow for condensation buildup on the dipstick. It can also create surface rust on the metal stick, making the oil look rusty-colored. There?s also the chance that some automatic transmission fluid could be leaking into the engine because of defects. When this happens, the mixture can appear rust-colored. However, it should be a sign that you need to get the car right to the mechanic. "
How to Read Oil Dipstick ?	"1. Park CarBefore you can do anything with the vehicle, you need to park and secure it. Try to park on level ground and set the handbrake.Turn off the engine and wait a couple of minutes, so the engine can cool down slightly. Once the engine is cooled off, you are ready to proceed. You can check the oil quality and level with the engine a little warm, but you must be careful where you touch it, as the components could still be hot. 2. Pull Out DipstickPop open the hood and find the engine oil dipstick. It may have a yellow handle on it or will be labeled ?Engine Oil.? If you can?t find it, look in the owner?s manual for an engine compartment map that shows you where everything is located.Pull out the dipstick. Make sure none of the oil drips off onto the motor, or it will create a burning smell once it gets hot. You can hold your rag or lint-free paper towel below it to keep it from dripping.3. Wipe DipstickWith a paper towel or rag, wipe the dipstick off. You aren?t looking to read the levels right now, you simply want to clean the dipstick off.Once the stick has been cleaned, you are ready to put it back in the tube. Push it in until it can?t go any further.4. Pull Out Dipstick AgainYou are going to pull the dipstick back out, but this time read the level. You can hold the rag at the bottom to keep the oil from dripping, but don?t wipe off the stick.Before you put the dipstick back, you want to take note of the oil level. It?s also important to look at the color of the motor oil.5. Read Condition & LevelThere will be two marks on the dipstick. The bottom line shows you that the oil level is low, while the other line is where it is full. You want the oil level to fall between these two lines. If it?s too low, you need to add some oil. On the other hand, when it goes beyond the full line, you need to remove some oil.It?s also time to evaluate the oil color. You can use the color chart I listed above to indicate what condition it is in. If it?s dirty, you need to change it, even if the oil level is good. It doesn?t do any good to run a whole bunch of dirty oil through the engine. "
How Often is Oil Change Needed?	"There was a time when all oil needed to be changed every 3,000 miles. However, newer technology and sophisticated oil blends have created a longer service life than most oils. There are some cars and oils that can go 10,000 miles or longer without an oil change. To determine how long your car can go, you want to start by reading the owner?s manual. The manufacturer has recommendations that you should follow, especially if your car is still under warranty. Additionally, the owner?s manual will tell you what type of oil to use. Beyond this, conventional oil needs to be changed more frequently. While synthetic and synthetic blend oils cost more, they can go much longer between changes. You must also consider your driving conditions. If you travel through extreme temperatures, down rough roads, or you spend a lot of time towing, you may need to change the oil more frequently. These frequencies are closer because of the extra work that?s occurring with the engine. The final consideration is the type of engine and car you drive. A diesel engine may require more frequent oil changes than a gas-powered motor. Additionally, turbo engines can require more oil changes at times.When you are in doubt, check the oil condition based on the color chart above. These colors show you when the oil needs to be changed. If it is still amber, there?s no reason to change it."
How Long Does An Oil Change Take?	"The average oil change will take between 20 and 45 minutes. During the oil change, the drain plug must be removed and the oil drained out into a pan. A new oil filter is installed and when the oil has been drained, the drain plug is put back in place and the fresh oil is added.For the majority of the oil change, it?s just a matter of waiting for it all to drain. If you take your car to a dealership, the technician will perform some further inspections during this time. If you perform your own oil change, you can also choose to do something else during this time. "
what the Factors Affecting Oil Change Time ?	"1. Person Changing the OilThe amount of time you spend getting your oil changed will be dramatically affected by who is doing the work. If you are doing it yourself, you must factor in the equipment you have and your expertise. On average, it could take you thirty minutes or more to get the oil change completed. On the other hand, a quick lube shop is going to be the fastest. These locations have the equipment to get your vehicle in and out as fast as possible. The oil change is performed and the car is back out the door.Sometimes, the longest option is to visit your local car dealership service center. While the oil change itself doesn?t take longer, the technicians provide other services at the same time. With these additional inspections, you have more peace of mind about the work provided, but your time waiting will be longer. Still, over the past few years, more dealerships have opened Express Lanes for faster oil change service. 2. Vehicle Type/AccessibilityEach type of vehicle must be evaluated for accessibility because some are easier to work on than others. For the majority of cars, the drain plug and filter are simple to get to, but that?s not the case with all of them.Most shops can get to the drain plug and filter quickly, but you could have more trouble doing it in your home garage. Sometimes, filters also need to be removed or installed with special tools. All of these factors affect the time. Additionally, if you are doing the work at home, you have to drag out the jack and jack stands to get under some vehicles safely. This process takes time too. 3. Engine SizeAdditionally, you need to think about how large the engine is that is being drained and filled. The more oil it holds, the longer it will take to remove the contaminated oil and refill it with fresh oil.If you have a four-cylinder or a V6 engine, it probably holds about five quarts of oil. However, diesel motors can hold a lot more. There are a few Cummins and PowerStroke engines that will hold up to 15 quarts of oil. In this case, it could easily take double the time to drain and refill the system than a standard car. Not only that, but the oil change service is going to cost more too. 4. Wait TimeIf you perform your own oil change, you don?t need to wait for anyone else. When you are ready to drain the oil and refill the engine, you can get to it right away.However, when you visit a lube or dealership, you will have to wait for other customers that are before you. If you show up at a first come first served type of location, you could have a longer wait than you planned on. "
Quick Lube vs. Service Center: Where to Get an Oil Change?	"If you don?t want to do your own oil change, you have two main options. You can visit the quick lube shop or a service center, whether it is at the dealership or it?s independent. With either option, there are some advantages and disadvantages that need to be discussed. Let?s start by looking at the quick lube shop. This is going to be your fastest option because it?s all this location does. The system operates like clockwork, moving one car after the next. However, this quick operation leaves time for nothing else to be accomplished. The technicians aren?t going to provide an inspection or look at anything else on the vehicle. You also might not find the best brand oil filter or oil recommended by the automaker. While you will pay about the same as a typical repair shop, you have nothing extra to show for it. Plus, the technicians can be entry-level. They don?t need special certifications, which is why some people find their drain plug stripped or the wrong filter used. When you take your vehicle to the dealership or service center, other tasks might be performed as part of the appointment. For example, most dealerships also check the wiper blades, battery, tires and lights during the oil change. These are all complimentary checks but do add some extra time to the service. Additionally, these shops are going to have qualified technicians and usually use brand-name parts, even OEM from the automaker, if you visit the dealership.If you are in a hurry, you might choose to visit the local lube, which is fine in a pinch. But overall, it?s better to trust your vehicle to the professionals at the dealership or independent service center. "
How Often Should You Get an Oil Change?	"There are numerous factors involved in figuring out how often an oil change is needed. Most vehicles are going to get an oil change every 5,000 to 10,000 miles. If you are driving an older vehicle using conventional oil, you will probably want to get an oil change every 3,000 miles. There are also other times that more frequent oil changes should occur, such as:If you only drive short distances. This would equate to five miles at a time in normal temperatures or ten miles in colder temperatures because the engine never gets heated up fully.The vehicle is used heavily to tow or haul cargo.You drive on muddy, sandy, dusty and rough rides.You spend a lot of time driving in stop-and-go traffic. Today?s modern vehicle doesn?t need an oil change so frequently. If you are driving a newer vehicle in normal conditions and you use synthetic or synthetic blend oil, you shouldn?t change the oil more frequently than every 5,000 miles. In many cases, the car could even go 7,500 to 10,000 miles between oil changes. If you aren?t sure, it?s best to read the service manual or talk to your local mechanic."
How to Tell if Engine is Damaged From No Oil?	"Strange sounds, such as metal grinding, are an indication that the engine may be damaged from no engine oil. Additionally, a burnt oil smell, an overheating engine or smoke coming from under the hood are all signs of permanent damage. An unresponsive or seized engine can also be a sign of low oil or damage.  There are some symptoms that clearly show that your car engine is damaged by no oil, but sometimes there are minor damages that will only appear in the future. Therefore it can be good to look for any signs of metal shavings in your engine oil before.1. Strange SoundsWhen the car engine is running as it should, you might hear it, but there won?t be any strange noises coming from it. However, when the oil has run low, there?s no longer proper lubrication occurring between the internal metal components. What you are left with is a grinding sound as these metal parts collide and damage one another. Additionally, you might hear some clunking, knocking or rattling noises. If you continue to drive the engine with no oil, the metal rods are going to break, rendering the car inoperable. 2. Burning Oil SmellAs lubrication seizes in the engine, the remaining oil may start to burn. In some cases, it means that there is a leak somewhere that is causing the oil to burn. However, the smell of burning oil coming from within the engine itself can mean that the metal parts are rubbing together, creating friction within the engine that shouldn?t be there. This friction heads up the remaining oil and causes it to burn. 3. Overheating EngineWithout the right amount of oil in the engine, it can start to overheat from the additional friction and wear. There have also been instances of engine fires because of severe damage. If you are watching the temperature gauge closely, you will know when there?s a problem. At the first sign of overheating, you should stop driving before you create more costly damage. 4. Smoke Under HoodAlong with overheating, you might see smoke pouring out from under the hood. Obviously, this is the first sign of a car fire, so you should immediately shut off the engine.Your only option right now is to shut down the car and let it cool. You probably won?t be able to get it home without creating a serious safety hazard. 5. Unresponsive EngineThe first signs that damage is occurring could be in the way the engine is responding to you. If it?s no longer powering up when you push the accelerator, the engine might be worn out or even seized. However, the decrease in performance could also be a warning sign that permanent damage is around the corner. There?s still a chance you might have caught the problem early enough, so be sure to stop driving it right away and have it checked out. "
What Happens to Car Engine Without Enough Oil?	"Oil is a necessary fluid in the engine. It?s meant to provide lubrication to the internal components and it helps to keep the temperatures in check. Without oil or without the proper levels, significant damage can occur in mere miles.In some cases, the engine block or crankshaft can crack. It?s also possible to wear out the rods and cylinders. In the end, the engine could completely seize, rendering the vehicle unmovable. "
How Long Can I Drive Without Engine Oil?	"If the engine oil is low, you might be able to drive a short distance to get more oil. However, if there is no engine oil in the motor at all, you shouldn?t drive, even a little. Within minutes, the engine can seize and fail to work again. To prevent this from occurring, you should always keep a close eye on your car?s oil levels. As soon as you notice them getting low, you should top the system off."
what the Signs of Low Engine Oil ?	"1. Oil Warning LightThe first sign that something is wrong is when the oil pressure warning light comes on. As the oil levels drop, the pressure also drops.When you see this warning light, you should stop the vehicle immediately. There?s a good chance that you can resolve the problem without causing permanent damage just by taking swift action. 2. Oil LeakIf you notice oil leaking out of the engine, this is an indication that the levels are going to be low. If the leak is small, you might be able to keep up with it for a short time by adding more oil until you can have it checked out.However, leaks can suddenly turn into a massive problem, leaving you stranded if the engine runs too low on oil. Plus, you don?t want to chance driving with the wrong amount of oil in the engine. Fixing the leak is going to be much cheaper than replacing an engine. 3. Sluggish PerformanceIf you are paying close attention to your car engine, you will notice when something isn?t right. When the engine is running smoothly, it?s responsive, quiet and ready to go.However, as the oil levels drop, the performance of the engine is going to suffer. The faster you notice the change, the better your chances of resolving it before damage happens.4. OverheatingBecause motor oil is used as a lubricant for the metal components, any lack of oil can cause excessive friction. This friction causes the engine to overheat.At first, the temperature may go up slightly, giving you time to respond. However, as the oil levels continue to drop, overheating will become inevitable, leaving you with permanent damage.5. Unusual NoisesYou may hear some minor sounds as the oil levels start to drop. These won?t be at the same level as when the engine has no oil or is being damaged.However, the ear that?s tuned to listen for trouble can catch problems early on just because of some minor tone differences. Make it a habit to listen to the engine so you get used to what it sounds like normally. "
Reasons for Oil Warning Light ?	"1. Low Oil LevelsAs we?ve discussed, one of the reasons for the oil pressure light to come on is a lack of oil. Your first step is to check the oil levels and ensure they are topped off.However, many cars can run with low oil without this pressure light coming on. It isn?t until the oil levels get dangerously low that this light will come on. 2. Reduced PressureThe most common reason for this light to come on is because of a reduction in pressure. There?s a sensor in the motor that determines if there?s enough oil being pumped through the engine.If there?s not enough pressure, the oil can?t reach all of the narrow passages of the engine, which leads to a lack of vital lubrication. Without the proper pressure, the engine parts are going to start rubbing together, even if there is enough oil in the motor itself.3. Faulty Oil PumpThe low pressure could be caused by a failing oil pump. The oil pump is responsible for pushing the oil out of the pan below the engine and circulating it through the motor.When the oil pump can?t do its job, the pressure inside the engine drops. Without the right amount of pressure, areas of the engine don?t receive the lubrication that?s needed. 4. Failing Oil Pressure SensorIn some cases, there?s not necessarily a mechanical failure occurring. It?s possible for the oil pressure sensor to get clogged up from contaminants and sludge. When this happens, the clogged sensor gives a false reading of the oil pressure, causing the light to come on.The main reason this problem occurs is because of poor maintenance. If you aren?t changing the oil regularly, you allow contamination to build up and damage the sensor."
What Type of Oil Does My Car Take?	"Before you choose oil for your car, you need to determine what viscosity is needed. You also want to know what type of oil is best for your car engine and look at the additives that might be included. Make sure the oil you use matches what?s recommended by the manufacturer. The easiest way to find the right type of oil for your car is to check the oil specifications in your owner?s manual. You can also go to an online auto parts store or an oil manufacturer?s website and submit your license plate number or VIN number, and they will often suggest the right type of motor oil for your vehicle.However, the most reliable and safest way is to check either in the owner?s manual or ask your local dealer directly."
how to Choose the Right Type of Engine Oil ?	"1. Oil ViscosityOil viscosity refers to the weight of the liquid. It?s the most important factor when you are choosing the right type. The viscosity rating shows how the oil can flow at varying temperatures. As engine oil gets hot, it becomes thinner. If it is cold, the oil will be thicker. Thicker oils provide more lubrication, but it can become harder to get the oil through the engine parts. Thinner oil flows better but doesn?t offer as much protection. The engine oil viscosity is written in the following format ? #W-##. The numbers show the viscosity of the oil, while the W stands for WINTER. As an example, 5W-30 shows the oil is thinner at cold temperatures than the 10W-30 oil. The number located after the W describes how thick the oil is at normal operating engine temperatures. In most cases, 5W-30 and 10W-40 tend to be the most used. These work well in most conditions. However, you might use 0W-30 if you live in sub-zero temperatures or 15W40 if you live in hot, humid conditions. You will also find the characters SAE (society of automotive engineers), which you can read more about here.2. Oil TypeConventional motor oil is the most traditional type available. It?s been the regular oil type for many decades. You can use it with any light-duty or late-model car if you are looking to keep the price down during an oil change. On the other end of the spectrum, you can choose full synthetic oil. These oils are manufactured to improve lubrication and oxidation protection. It could also fight back against sludge buildup. However, it?s the most expensive option during an oil change. That added cost often gives you more time between oil changes. If you don?t want to spend that much money, you might prefer a synthetic blend oil. The synthetic-blend motor oil contains some of the characteristics of fully synthetic, but the mixture of conventional base oils allows the price to be slightly lower. It?s a good middle-ground option if you want to transition from conventional to synthetic. However, you should always choose the suggested oil from the manufacturer!High mileage oil is also available to use in vehicles with more than 75,000 miles on the odometer. This oil is specifically designed to reduce oil leaks or seepage on engines with higher mileage. It also reduces oil consumption and can create less smoke. 3. AdditivesThere are many different additives that can be included with the oil you choose, so you want to know what you are using. Some oils contain antioxidants to slow down the oxidation process. Anti-wear agents are included to protect the internal components from higher temperatures.Detergents keep deposits to a minimum, while dispersants allow the oil to absorb solid contaminants before they can cause damage. With foam inhibitors, the motor oil won?t form as many bubbles. Friction modifiers reduce the friction when the engine operates under high temperatures or while pulling a heavy load. Additionally, rust and corrosion inhibitors are vital to reducing wear from moisture. Oil can also contain viscosity-index improvers. With these additives, the engine oil performs well, even when the temperatures fluctuate."
what the Factors To Consider When Choosing Oil?	"1. ClimateWhile you must follow everything the manufacturer recommends, you also want to consider the climate. The majority of engine oils will cover a variety of temperature ranges.If you live in a hotter climate, you might prefer using a higher-grade viscosity that resists thinning, such as 10W-40. On the other hand, cooler climates demand something that thins faster, such as 5W-30.2. Driving HabitsIf you are pushing your car to extremes with high-performance vehicles, you want to consider using a different type of oil. Heading off-road or towing regularly will cause your engine to work harder than normal. Not only should you consider using oil with special additives, but you might also need to get oil changes more frequently. Additionally, if you drive short distances, you may not be allowing the car?s engine to get to normal operating temperatures. When this occurs, more condensation builds up in the engine, leading to sludge build-up and higher emissions. With these conditions, you want to carefully choose what engine oil additives are being used, seriously consider er something that will break down the sludge or prevent corrosion. 3. Engine AgeIf you drive a modern vehicle, your engine is made to different standards than the older vehicles. These high-rev, multi-valve engines use a thinner oil. Otherwise, there could be damage when the engine starts up. With the older engine, you need a thicker oil to create the right amount of oil pressure for the internal components. Additionally, you might choose to use a high mileage motor oil if the engine is older. These types can provide more protection, helping you keep the engine running longer. "
Can I Mix Different Types of Oil?	"While you can mix oil types, it doesn?t mean that you should. In general, mixing oil types only leads to wasting money. When you add full synthetic motor oil to your conventional oil, you don?t extend the life of the oil. It will still need to be changed as if it was all conventional oil, meaning you threw the quality of the synthetic oil away. The synthetic blend isn?t just conventional mixed with synthetic. It is specially formulated to offer better engine protection against the weather and driving conditions. "
How Often Should Oil Be Changed?	"You may need to change conventional oil every 3,000 miles or three months, whichever comes first. Some newer models can go a little longer between oil changes, so reference the service manual to determine what?s best. However, the average engine running synthetic oil doesn?t require an oil change for 6,000 or more miles. You can go up to six months without an oil change, saving you a lot of time. While you might pay more for synthetic oil upfront, the less frequent changes help to level the playing field. Don?t forget to change your oil filter when you change the oil. If you leave a contaminated oil filter in place, you will allow debris and dirt into the fresh oil, thereby reducing its effectiveness. "
How Much Oil Does My Car Take?	"It truly depends on what type of engine your car has. The majority of today?s engines will hold between five and six quarts of oil. However, compact four-cylinder motors can hold as little as four quarts, while a big truck engine could hold up to eight or nine. Most four-cylinder motors are going to hold five quarts or less because the motor is smaller. In comparison, a bigger six-cylinder might hold around six quarts. On the high end of the spectrum, an eight-cylinder could hold five to eight quarts of oil."
Where to Find the Oil Capacity of my  Car Engine ?	"1. Owner?s ManualThe traditional way of finding out what your vehicle needs is to read the owner?s manual. Not only will this manual tell you how much oil to use, but it will also show you what type is best.If you have lost the manual or didn?t get it with a used car, you might need to try one of our other options. You can also buy a new one, possibly from eBay or another online platform. 2. Online ResourcesThere are plenty of ways to find the information online, with the web providing an outlet for anything you need. You can search a database on a local auto parts store website.You can also Google the information and see what comes up. Just make sure you take the specifications from a reliable source, or you might find yourself in a jam. One reliable service you can use for free is Castrol?s website.3. MechanicReach out to your local dealership for help. The service department will be able to look up the information for you. It?s also possible that the parts department would be willing to help.You will need to give them the car model, year and make. They may also ask for the engine size. If you don?t know all of this, simply provide them with the VIN or vehicle identification number. Remember, you don?t have to be stuck with the dealership. If they don?t provide the help you need, reach out to an independent mechanic instead."
what the Signs It?s Time for an Oil Change ?	"Why do you need to know how much oil is in your vehicle? When you perform an oil change, you will need to refill the system. Here are a few signs that indicate it?s time to drain and refill the oil with the appropriate amount.Oil light comes on. This indicates that the oil level is low. You might need to change it or just fill it up a little.Oil pressure gauge reads low. Not all vehicles are equipped with this gauge, but it?s helpful for learning when there?s a problem. Rough-running engine. By changing the oil, you help remove any deposits on the lifters that are causing a problem.Drop in fuel economy. As the motor oil gets dirty, it becomes harder for the engine to operate efficiently. You will notice a difference in the gas mileage your vehicle gets. Any time the engine seems to be running rough or you notice a change in performance, you want to have the oil levels checked. "
What if the Motor Oil is Too Low?	"You don?t want to run your engine with the oil low. It?s needed to lubricate the internal parts of the motor. Additionally, it?s needed to reduce friction in the motor. What you might not know is that motor oil also works to keep the engine running at normal temperatures. For these reasons, you need motor oil for the engine to run its best.For a short time, you can run the engine without a full reading, but only if it is mildly low. You don?t want to run it more than a quart low for any reason. Otherwise, you are going to put more wear on the engine, especially at startup. You could also damage the valuable engine parts, such as the valves, cam bearing and lifters. If you end up needing an engine rebuild, this is going to cost far more than if you put a quart of oil in the vehicle. "
What if the Motor Oil is Too High?	"On the opposite end of the spectrum, it?s possible to overfill the engine. You might think that there?s no such thing as too much of something, but that?s not the case with your motor. When there?s an excessive amount of motor oil in the crankcase, the crankshaft and pump start to aerate it. The motor oil turns into a frothy mixture.This mixture creates a massive amount of air moving among the components of the engine. The oil pump is going to pick up much of the air as it is moving the oil. Additionally, if you are traveling at higher speeds, such as on a highway, the crankshaft starts to turn as much as twenty times per second. This leads to even more aeration. As the oil becomes bubbly and frothy, it can no longer lubricate the internal parts as well, causing severe engine damage along the way. The oil level should always read between the two lines on the dipstick. These lines should read something like ?Full? and ?Add.? If the levels aren?t at these markers, you must take action to protect the car engine from damage. "
How to Change the Oil in My Car ?	"5 Steps to Change the Oil in Your Car1. Gather SuppliesMechanic ToolsBefore you perform any maintenance task, you need to have the supplies required. After all, it?s never fun to stop mid-job to go get something you should have had in the first place. For this job, you want to get a wrench or socket to remove the drain plug. You will also need an oil filter wrench and oil drain pan. If you need to lift the vehicle for more clearance, a jack and jack stands will also be required. Don?t forget to get the right type of oil for your car. You will have to choose the appropriate viscosity and determine whether you want synthetic or conventional. Finally, a new oil filter and a funnel will also be needed. 2. Drain the OilDrain Oil CarThe best time to change the oil is when the engine is warm but not burning hot. You want to make sure the exhaust has also cooled down before getting started.Next, you should locate the drain plug. In some cases, you will need to lift the vehicle and put it on jack stands for easier access. If there is a splash shield in the way, you will need to remove this as well.Put your drain pan directly below the plug. Take off the oil filler cap to help the fluid flow easier. With gloves on, take the drain plug out and let the old oil flow into the drain pan. 3. Tighten the PlugTighten Oil PlugAs the oil is being removed, clean off the oil plug to ensure a secure fit. The drain plug must be installed to appropriate specs, but it can be difficult to find the torque requirements in most owners? manuals.In most cases, it makes sense to use a 3/8? ratchet to tighten the plug. If you use anything larger than that, you could over-tighten the plug. 4. Replace the Oil FilterChange Oil FilterUse the special wrench to take off the oil filter. You want to do this over the drain pan because it can be a messy job with oil still found inside of the filter.Dab a little bit of the fresh oil on your new filter?s O-ring. Spin the filter on at first. Once the O-ring makes contact, you want to tighten the filter three-quarters to a full turn further. Do not overtighten the filter or you might not be able to get it off at the next oil change. If your oil filter is located on top of your engine. It is often wise to replace it before draining the oil, as this will allow more oil to drain into the oil pan.5. Pour in Fresh Oil Fill Motor OilWith the drain plug in place and the new filter on, you are ready to put more oil in the engine. Verify that you are using the right type and amount according to the owner?s manual.With the funnel, pour the fresh oil into the filler. Put the cap back in place and run the engine for a minute to circulate the oil. Check the level and add more oil if needed. If the car is up on jacks, you will need to lower it to the level ground first."
How Often Should the Oil be Changed?	"It wasn?t that long ago that all cars required oil changes every 3,000 miles. While this is still the recommended interval when using conventional oil or older cars, it?s often unnecessary with modern vehicles, no matter what your local dealership tells you. If you choose a synthetic or synthetic blend of oil and a high-quality filter, you might be able to go up to 10,000 miles between oil changes. However, your driving style and conditions will affect how long you can go without an oil change as well. After the first few oil changes, you will be able to determine an appropriate interval based on what the oil looks like. You want to get to it before the oil turns black but don?t need to change it if it continues looking fresh. "
How Much Money is Saved Changing Your Own Oil?	"If you take your vehicle to a lube shop for a conventional oil and filter change, you might spend between $40 and $80. However, getting a synthetic oil change could cost $60 to $130. By doing it yourself, you might only spend $25 to $50 for the supplies. This translates to a potential savings of up to $100 or more each time the oil needs to be changed. "
How Long Does an Oil Change Take?	"If you take your vehicle to the lube shop, you can often wait in your car while they change the oil in as little as ten minutes. However, these technicians are performing oil changes all day, every day. They can practically perform the oil change in their sleep and they have advanced equipment making it easier.If you do your own oil change, you will likely need a little more time. With the first oil change, give yourself about an hour to learn the ins and outs of the process. For repeat oil changes, you will get faster with the process. In total, it shouldn?t take you more than thirty minutes with most vehicles."
what are the Symptoms of Bad or Leaking Oil Pan Gasket ?	"The main symptoms of a bad oil pan gasket include:Visible oil leakLow Oil LevelCheck engine lightOverheating engineHere is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or leaking oil pan gasket to look for:1. Visible LeakCar Oil LeakThe most common symptom of a faulty oil pan gasket is a visible leak. While small leaks will leave residue around the oil pan, you?ll notice oil drips as the problem worsens. You?ll typically first see this underneath where you park your vehicle for the night. If you let this oil residue build-up, it will stain the affected area, and it?s not something you can easily remove after the fact.2. Low Oil LevelEngine Oil LevelYour oil pan holds your engine oil, and the oil pan gasket keeps the oil in the oil pan. So, if your vehicle has a leak, then the oil is escaping when it shouldn?t, and your overall oil level is going to drop.So, if you pull the dipstick and find that you don?t have enough oil in your engine, you need to find out where it?s going. It?s pretty common to find that it?s escaping from a leaky oil pan gasket.3. Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light Reset ItselfWhile there?s no sensor to tell you that your oil pan gasket is leaking, there is a sensor to let you know that you don?t have enough oil. If enough of your oil has leaked out and you?re running on dangerously low oil, you might have a check engine light or engine oil level light.If you have a check engine light for low oil, it?s only a matter of time until your engine overheats, and you cause serious engine damage.4. Overheating EngineOverheating Car EngineThis is not a very common symptom, but it can happen. One of the engine oil functions is to cool your engine, so it?s not surprising that your engine might overheat if the oil is leaking out.If you have an overheating engine due to a leaking oil pan, then you have a serious problem that you need to address right away. While many sites will tell you to look for excess engine smoke, this is rarely a symptom of a leaking oil pan gasket.That?s because, in order to link excess smoke to an oil pan gasket leak, the oil has to leak out of the gasket and find its way to the top of an exhaust line, then it has to burn off there. Even then, the excess smoke won?t be coming out of the exhaust.Instead, it will be coming straight off where it is burning from. If you have blueish smoke, it?s more likely that oil has found its way into the combustion chamber, which is indicative of an internal problem, not a leaking oil pan gasket."
Oil Pan Gasket Location ?	"Your vehicle?s oil pan gasket is located directly on top of the oil pan. You can find the oil pan on the lowest point of your engine, and it?s usually a metal, rectangular pan attached to the bottom of your engine with some bolts.The gasket is at the top of the pan, so if you?re replacing the oil pan gasket, you?ll need to remove the oil pan and scrape off the old gasket before adding a new one."
Oil Pan Gasket Function ?	"Your vehicle uses the oil pan gasket to keep all of the oil inside the oil pan. Without the gasket, you would have a metal-on-metal connection from the top of the oil pan to the bottom of the engine. Not only would this lead to a lot of wear and tear, but it also won?t form any sort of seal.That means whenever oil passes through the area, it will find nooks and crannies to escape from. The oil pan gasket sits between those two components and forms a tight seal around the area. That way, none of the oil can escape.It might sound like a simple job, and it is, but without you?d continuously be adding new oil to your engine, and you?d be risking engine damage. So, your oil pan gasket is simple, but it?s essential."
what are the Oil Pan Gasket Replacement Cost ?	"The average oil pan gasket replacement cost is between $100 and $350, depending on what kind of vehicle you drive and where you take it for repairs. The oil pan gasket costs $20 to $80 and the rest is labor costs.The good news is that for most vehicles, the oil pan gasket is fairly easy to reach, and it?s not that difficult to replace. In fact, you can typically find an aftermarket oil pan gasket for your vehicle for between $20 and $80. However, you will want to replace the oil and oil filter as well, so you?ll need to add another $50 to $100 for those parts too.Also, keep in mind that aftermarket parts are generally a little cheaper than OEM. But just because they?re less expensive doesn?t mean they?re not as good!Still, this can save you up to $400 compared to taking it to a repair shop! Just take a look at your vehicle and determine if you?ll be able to drop your oil pan straight down before ordering any parts. Also, keep in mind that the oil pickup tube is inside the oil pan, so you?ll need plenty of space to drop it down to clear the pickup tube! Sometimes the front beam is in the way, which means that you need to lift the engine.Some engines have a sealant instead of a gasket and in this case, you need to choose the right sealant for your engine."
What Causes An Oil Pressure Warning Light?	"The most common cause of a low oil pressure warning light coming on is a low oil level. It can also be caused by a faulty oil pump, pickup tube, clogged oil filter or an internal oil leak. It could be a false alarm, caused by a bad oil pressure sensor or faulty wiring.As said, there are actually two scenarios when the oil pressure light illuminates. It can either be a false alarm or a problem with the oil pressure sensor or the wirings to it.The other scenario is that your engine actually has low oil pressure, which is a little bit more serious. Therefore, we recommend starting checking the oil pressure with a manual oil pressure guide to know where to start your troubleshooting. Here is a video of how to check the oil pressure.Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of an oil pressure light on your dashboard:1. Low Engine Oil LevelEngine Oil LevelTo achieve proper oil pressure in the engine, the engine needs to have oil available to pressurize. If there is no oil to pressurize, it will be impossible for the oil pump to properly do its job.If your oil pressure light comes on and sometimes disappears, especially when you turn the car, a low engine oil level might be the cause. You may also notice a yellow oil can symbol on your dashboard.Checking the engine oil level is pretty straightforward. Just check your car?s service manual, and you will find instructions there on how to do it properly.However, as a car owner, it is your responsibility to check the oil level regularly. This is a vital part of regular car maintenance. You may easily destroy your engine if you drive without checking your oil level on a regular basis.2. Faulty Oil Pressure SensorOil Pressure Sensor LocationThe oil pressure is actually the sensor that monitors the engine?s oil pressure, and its only job is to switch the oil pressure light on or off. These sensors are often made of plastic, and it is not unheard of for these sensors to fail.If you locate it on the engine block and you see a lot of engine oil around it, that may be a sign that there is a crack in the sensor, which may cause it to fail to read the oil pressure properly.You can measure these sensors? resistance with a multimeter to determine if they are functional or not. You need to find the right values for the specific sensor, though. Here is a video of how you can check it: How to test an oil pressure sensor3. Faulty Oil Pressure Sensor WiringsBroken WiringsFor the sensor to function, it needs one or two wires going between the instrument cluster and the oil pressure sensor.The engine compartment becomes hot while you are driving, and there are constant vibrations. This can cause wirings to get a bad connection or actually fail and break off completely.When the instrument cluster can?t feel the signal from the oil pressure sensor because of a broken wire or bad connection, it will light up the oil pressure light.Check the connector at the oil pressure sensor for any corrosion signs, and make sure that the wires look good.The next step is to measure the wiring, but I?m not going to explain how to do that in this article. At the very least, you will need a wiring diagram and some basic car electrical skills.It is not very common for the wires to go bad, so it is recommended to check the rest of the potential causes in this article first.4. Faulty Oil PumpOil Pressure InsideThe oil pump is the pump that pressurizes the oil inside of the engine. A chain often drives it from the crankshaft, but it can also be built directly around the crankshaft.It sometimes happens that this oil pump fails, which can cause a low oil pressure. The low oil pressure will cause the oil pressure light to show up on your dashboard.The oil pump also has an overpressure valve inside of it, which can fail, and this will also cause the oil pressure to drop.However, to replace this valve, you often need to disassemble the whole engine, so you anyways want to replace the whole oil pump instead of just the valve.5. Clogged Oil Pickup TubeVw Oil Pressure HiccupFor the oil pump to reach the oil all the way from the bottom of the oil pan, it must have a tube. Unfortunately, dirt is also collected on the bottom of the oil pan.This tube contains a ?net? to prevent dirt and other parts from getting sucked into the oil pump. If your car is old, and especially if the car?s oil maintenance has been bad, this pickup tube can get clogged by dirt and other oil sludge.When this tube gets clogged, it will cause the oil pump not to suck oil anymore, resulting in low oil pressure.To fix this issue, you need to remove the oil pan and clean or replace the oil pump pickup tube.6. Clogged Oil filterBad Oil FiltersInside a car engine, there are often many metal chips, carbon deposits, and other debris. The oil filter plays an important role in filtering all these contaminants and preventing them from entering the engine.During regular maintenance of the engine, the mechanic replaces the oil filter. If you follow the schedule of oil changes recommended for your car engine, there is no risk of getting a clogged oil filter.However, if you haven?t taken care of your car?s service maintenance properly, you may actually get a clogged oil filter caused by oil sludge. Your oil pressure to drop, causing an oil pressure light on your dashboard.7. Faulty Instrument ClusterInstrument Cluster FailedIt?s possible that there isn?t any problem with the sensor or low oil pressure at all. It may actually just be a problem with the instrument cluster.Inside the instrument cluster, there are many solderings, and in some car models, cracks can appear in these solderings. This will cause the connection to get worse, and eventually, it will light up the oil pressure light.To find these solderings, you need to help a professional who knows how to disassemble the cluster and check for cracks.To replace the cluster, you often need to reprogram it to the vehicle with a diagnostic tool, because the immobilizer is often integrated into it. This can often only be done by an authorized dealer.8. Internal Oil LeakCrankcase CarInternal oil leaks mean that the oil is leaking inside the engine, and you cannot see it without disassembling the engine. This is a fairly rare scenario and should only be considered if you have eliminated all other possible causes.Internal oil leaks are also very difficult to find, and you will need to disassemble the engine to look for cracks or other signs of leaks.9. Clogged oil passagesEngine BlockMost of the engine oil is stored in the oil pan. The oil pump pressurizes the oil to circulate to the engine and the subsequent moving parts.As soon as the oil leaves the pump, it moves through the oil filter. This removes most of the impurities. The oil then flows through the crankshaft and the head of the car engine.However, if any of these oil passages are clogged, it may cause the oil not to reach the oil pressure sensor, and it will cause the oil pressure to become low.This isn?t a very common problem either, and everything else should be considered first before you look into it.10. Wear of engine partsBad Rod BearingOil is needed to keep the crankshaft, cam bearings, and other moving parts working at their best.When these components wear out like bad bearings, oil begins to leak through the openings. This leak might contribute to low oil pressure.If you have noticed a slowly decreasing oil pressure in your engine over time, it can definitely be a sign of wear inside of your engine."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Oil Pressure Sensor ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad or failing oil pressure sensor are an oil pressure light on your dashboard, a noisy engine, or engine performance issues. You may also notice that the oil pressure sensor is leaking oil.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing oil pressure sensor to look for:1. Oil pressure light on dashboard Engine Oil Pressure LightOne of the most common symptoms of a faulty oil pressure sensor is your oil pressure light illuminating on your dash cluster. This light is illuminated when your oil pressure sensor detects low oil pressure or high oil pressure and then sends a signal to your ECU, which then passes a signal to your dash cluster, switching on your oil warning light. This is how this system should work in theory. However, if your sensor is faulty, then it will switch the oil light on, even if the oil pressure is okay.The easiest way to determine this fault is to manually check your oil pressure with an oil pressure gauge. If your oil pressure is normal, this indicates a faulty sensor. Another method of diagnosing this fault is to use a fault code reader and see if there are any stored faults in your vehicle?s ECU pertaining to your oil pressure sensor. 2. Noisy Timing Chain and EngineTiming ChainIf your engine has a timing chain that is oil fed, then having the correct oil pressure is even more important. This is because your chain uses the oil pumped from your oil pump to keep itself lubricated and moving freely. The tensioners that hold the chain?s tension in place are also often oil fed, which again is another reason why maintaining oil pressure is vital. If your engine oil pressure drops, this can cause your chain tensioners to slacken off, which leaves you with a loose chain that whips and gets thrown around against the various pulleys and housings. This is usually audible as you stand next to the vehicle while the engine is sat at idle. It will sound like a deep, metallic rattling noise coming from your engine block. If you can hear this from your engine, but your oil light hasn?t come on, this can be a sign of a faulty oil pressure sensor. If your chain has lost its tension due to a lack of oil pressure, and your oil light hasn?t illuminated on your dash cluster, you should replace the oil pressure sensor after carrying out the necessary repairs on your engine to rectify the fault with the chain.You may also experience other noisy engine parts if your oil pressure is low.3. Oil Leak From Oil Pressure Sensor Engine Oil LeakYour oil pressure sensor is designed to be sat in the oil system of your car so that it can detect the oil pressure. However, this can sometimes lead to your oil pressure leaking oil, either from the threads or through the center of the actual sensor itself. Vauxhalls are known for having this as a common problem on some of their models. The oil pressure sensor leaks oil through the center of its body, filling the block connector and spraying the engine bay with oil. You can easily diagnose this fault by checking for any oil leaks from around the pressure sensor. Remove the sensor?s block connector to check inside for oil. If you find any oil in either of these locations, then you?ll need to replace your sensor. You can also visually inspect the sensor whilst the engine is idling and make sure there?s no sign of any oil leaking from the sensor body."
what are an Oil Pressure Sensor?	"Most modern cars have an oil pressure sensor fitted somewhere on the engine block. This sensor allows the vehicle?s ECU to determine the ? yep, you guessed it ? running pressure of the oil within the engine. This allows the engine to passively monitor whether the oil system loses pressure. If for whatever reason, your engine does lose its oil pressure, this can result in major damage to the rest of your engine, which is the main reason that it is constantly monitored. The pressure is created by your vehicle?s oil pump, which simply lifts the engine oil from your sump to the head of your engine to both cool and lubricate the various engine components. If the oil pressure drops, then your engine is no longer able to stay lubricated or cooled effectively, and this can result in components seizing, causing irreversible damage and a heavy repair bill. This is the main reason why your oil pressure is constantly monitored. So, as soon as your oil pressure light comes on, switch off the engine and don?t restart until it?s been repaired. By doing this, you?ll prevent further damage from taking place. "
Oil Pressure Sensor Location  ?	"The exact location of your oil pressure sensor can vary depending on your make, model and engine.The oil pressure sensor is often located in the engine block near the bottom of the cylinder head. But it can also be installed on the cylinder head. It will have a block connector attached to it, and have 1 or 2 thin wires attached. "
what are the Oil Pressure Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"The average oil pressure sensor replacement cost is between $50 and $250, depending on the car model and labor costs. An oil pressure sensor costs $30 to $100, and the labor costs $20 to $150.The cost for an oil pressure sensor will depend entirely on your vehicle?s specific product number for the part, but you can expect to pay anything from $5?$100. Fortunately, if you want to pay someone to fit it, labor will usually only be between 30 Minutes?1 Hour, depending on where the sensor is located."
Diagnosing a faulty oil pressure sensor ?	"Diagnosing a faulty oil pressure sensor is often pretty straightforward if you have the sensor?s correct measurements. The sensor does often have just one or two pins, which should have a specific resistance to ground. To know the exact resistance you need at a given oil pressure, you need to check your repair manual or the oil pressure sensor manufacturer?s manuals."
Can I drive with a faulty oil pressure sensor?	"If you have a faulty oil pressure sensor, it is best to replace it as soon as possible. The oil pressure sensor is responsible for monitoring the oil pressure in the engine and acting as a warning system if the pressure gets too low. This can help to prevent engine damage caused by low oil pressure. While you can drive with a faulty oil pressure sensor, it is not advisable to do so since there is a risk of engine damage if you can?t see when the oil pressure is low."
How long do oil pressure sensors last?	"Oil pressure sensors are designed to last a long time ? typically, the lifetime of the vehicle on most car models. It is also quite rare that they wear out. However, like any other component in your car, they can eventually fail."
How long does it take to replace an oil pressure sensor?	"It depends on the make and model of your vehicle, but generally speaking, it shouldn?t take more than 1 hour to replace an oil pressure sensor. However, if you?re not familiar with working on cars, it can take longer, and it?s always best to consult a professional mechanic to make sure the job is done correctly."
How do I reset my oil pressure sensor?	"There is no way to reset a normal oil pressure sensor. After you install the new one, just start the car engine. If everything else is good and there are no other issues with the oil pressure or wirings, and you should see the oil pressure light disappear."
Conclusion	"Due to the oil sensor?s simple design, they tend to be fairly cheap to pick up and easy to replace. Just be careful that you watch for oil leaking out as you remove the sensor from the engine block. You?ll also want to be careful that you don?t over-tighten your new sensor, as this is an easy mistake to make. Any time you work on a part of your engine that involves oil, it?s always best to wear gloves to protect your skin from the harmful chemicals that are built into the oil. Also, once the work is completed, check your oil level with your vehicle sitting on a flat, level surface and top up if required."
 what are the Causes of High Oil Pressure ?	"The most common causes of high oil pressure are a cold engine, the wrong type of motor oil, or a faulty oil pressure sensor. It could also be caused by a faulty relief valve in the oil pump or a damaged oil filter.While these are some of the symptoms, they aren?t all of them! Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of high oil pressure.1. Cold EngineCold EngineEngine temperature is the most common reason for high oil pressure. Many people do not realize that your engine normally has very high pressure when your engine oil is cold. It is usually twice as high as when the engine is warm ? possibly even higher.Check your pressure when your engine oil is hot instead. If the pressure is too high when the engine oil is hot, it is time to start worrying.2. Wrong Oil GradeEngine Oil TypeExperimenting with different oil grades can sometimes be a bad decision, especially if you don?t consult an expert. Different oil grades have distinct viscosity levels and are meant for certain engine types.If you have the wrong oil grade for your car engine, you may experience a very high oil pressure because of it. The recommended oil grade for your engine can be found in the owner?s manual.3. Blocked PassageEngine CylindersIf the oil changes haven?t been done properly in your car through the years, it may have caused oil sludge in your engine, which may have clogged any oil passage.Blockage in the oil passages can cause high pressure since the engine is deprived of proper lubrication.Unfortunately, high oil pressure will also cause low oil pressure in another part of your engine. Therefore, it is essential not to let your engine run before you fix the clogged oil passage.4. Problem With the Oil Pressure SensorOil Pressure SensorAre you sure there is actually high oil pressure in your engine? Is it possible you are actually dealing with a sensor or gauge that is showing you the wrong oil pressure?Sometimes, what looks like high oil pressure can actually be due to a faulty oil pressure sensor or oil pressure gauge. The gauge might show an overly high pressure when, in reality, the pressure is fine.Diagnose it with a manual oil pressure tester to get the right pressure before you start taking your engine apart.5. Relief Valve MalfunctionOil Pressure InsideThe relief valve?s function is to relieve excessive oil if the oil pressure gets too high. If the relief valve is clogged or faulty, it may not let excess oil pass through it, and instead, it will create high oil pressure in the system.The relief valve is often located inside the oil pump and is very difficult to reach. Most of the time, you have to replace the whole oil pump.6. Contaminated or damaged Oil FilterNew Vs Old Oil FilterIf the oil pressure sensor is installed between the oil pump and the oil filter, there is a chance that the oil filter can cause high oil pressure before the filter, where the pressure sensor is located.Usually, original oil pressure sensors are located behind the oil filter, so in this case, it would cause a low oil pressure rather than too high oil pressure.7. Poor Quality OilEngine Oil RefillIf you bought a very cheap quality oil, there might be a problem with their oil grades, and other specifications do not compare very well to reality.Using low-quality oil can be the reason behind high or low pressure. A poor quality oil that is thin or lightweight can easily pass through the engine and will cause low pressure, whereas thick oil would require a high pressure to flow.If you change the oil to a different brand and notice an increase in pressure, it may mean that it is not good for your engine."
What?s the Ideal Oil Pressure?	"The ideal oil pressure ranges between 25 to 65 psi when the engine oil is warm and at 1000-3000 rpm; if the oil pressure reading shows 80 psi or above when the engine is warm, then there is a serious problem.This, of course, depends on what engine you have and how worn the engine is. If you want to learn the exact oil pressure you should have in your car engine, I recommend checking your car repair manual!"
how to check car Oil Pressure ?	"Checking your car's oil pressure is an important part of routine maintenance, as low oil pressure can lead to engine damage or failure. Here's how you can check your car's oil pressure:Make sure your car is parked on a level surface and the engine is cool.Locate the oil pressure gauge or light on your dashboard.Start the engine and let it idle for a few minutes to warm up the oil.Observe the oil pressure gauge or light on your dashboard. If your car has a gauge, it should show a reading between 25-60 PSI (pounds per square inch) at idle, depending on the make and model of your car. If your car has a light, it should go off after a few seconds of the engine starting.If the oil pressure gauge shows low pressure or the oil pressure light stays on, turn off the engine immediately to avoid damage to your engine.Check your car's oil level and condition. If the oil level is low or the oil is dirty or contaminated, it could be causing low oil pressure.If your oil level and condition are fine, it's best to have your car inspected by a mechanic to determine the cause of the low oil pressure.It's important to regularly check your car's oil pressure and address any issues promptly to avoid serious engine damage."
What Are The Symptoms Of High Oil Pressure?	"The main symptoms of high oil pressure include:Oil Pressure light on the dashboardOil leaksHigh crankcase pressureYou often only see it if you have a manual gauge installed on your engine; this is standard in some cars.Another symptom of high oil pressure is oil leaks around the engine. High oil pressure can also cause high crankcase pressure, which could cause your engine to start to leak oil through the gaskets.The oil pressure light will flash on your dashboard on some cars if the pressure gets too high!"

Oil Filters ? Buyer?s Guide	"Especially for first-timers, buying an oil filter is a demanding task. It needs plenty of research and homework. This buyer?s guide will let you into the considerations you need to make while buying an oil filter. Filtration media Inside every filter, there?s a material that handles the whole filtering process. The media or the material can be synthetic, cellulose, or a blend of both. The synthetic ones usually use polyester, glass, or nylon because of their tightly woven structure. This structure results in better filtration efficiency. Synthetic media can catch even the tiniest impurities without compromising the oil flow rate. On the other hand, cellulose media is a more affordable option. However, everything this cost-effectiveness is directly related to its inferior filtration quality. Many buyers tend to go with the blended media because it is reasonably priced and offers functionality. Capacity The oil filter?s capacity represents the product?s ability to hold back the contaminants. There are primarily two factors that affect the oil filter?s power ? the build and the media. More capacity means better and longer mileage.  When the filter reaches the maximum capacity, it cannot carry out the filtration process. It also means that the equipment will allow unfiltered oil into the car?s system. Ease of use Oil filters in the market are not alike. There are different shapes and sizes available. Not all filters can fit your vehicle. When you pick an oil filter that is compatible with your car, it should also have a straightforward installation process. The filter should not make you run to the mechanic each time. Design & Construction Any filter should offer durability and value for money. Every car or vehicle follows a different specification. The weight and design of the filter determine its compatibility with your car. You have to ensure that the filter complements the structure of your vehicle. You can read the owner?s manual to determine the filter design and weight requirements to understand the best fit. It is also a good idea to look for a filter that has a paint-coating. This coat can relieve you of rust and corrosion. "

How Much Metal in Oil is Normal?	"It?s not uncommon for the engine oil to have minuscule metal shavings occasionally. However, these should be impossible to see through the human eye. However, if you notice a collection of metal shavings in the oil, it should be alarming. If you want to check to see if there are tiny metal particles, you can use a magnet. Another way to look for metal is to cut open the filter and pour out the oil from inside into a pan. To see how much metal is in the oil, you will want to drain it when it is still clean. You won?t be able to notice them as well if the oil is dark. At 10,000 miles, it?s common to see some metal particles as the engine breaks in. If you see them after that, you should be much more concerned. Once you notice some metal shavings, you want to perform an oil and filter change. After that, remove the filter again after a day or two to see what?s happening. If the metal shavings persist or there are more than just a few particles, you need to have the engine looked at immediately. "
How Does Metal Get in the Oil?	"If the engine is new, a few particles can just be a part of the break-in process. However, accumulating shavings that occur unexpectedly points to a sign of wear within the motor. Without proper lubrication, the metal parts inside the engine start to rub, allowing shavings to erode from the parts. These metal shavings are left in the oil, which can lead to further issues as they are circulated through the engine. Once the vital engine parts wear down, the damage becomes irreversible. That?s why it is so important to catch the issue early, before a new motor is needed. On top of that, you want to ensure regular engine maintenance to promote better lubrication. With a little care, you can avoid wearing out the engine components in the first place. "
What Do Metal Shavings Mean?	"Metal shavings in oil have different meanings based on what type they are. However, it can be difficult to tell the difference between some of the substances without experience. You might find that seeing a professional is best if you aren?t sure what you are looking at. Here are the different types of metal shavings you might find and what each means. 1. IronThese metal shavings indicate a rotating component within the engine is wearing. There are several engine parts that are made of iron that might be rubbing and wearing. For example, the crankshaft and camshaft are constructed from this metal. It could also be caused by any of the iron valve train components. With any of these parts, there will likely be a major engine repair in your future. Still, you will probably be experiencing other engine complaints by the time these parts start to wear out. 2. Copper, Bronze or BrassThe appearance of these shavings is unlike any of the others, so they are much more recognizable. If you see any of these colored shavings, it?s possible you are dealing with bushings that have worn out.It?s also possible that the metal is coming from a bearing that failed. These are all small parts but can lead to huge trouble when they are bad. 3. Molybdenum or ChromiumBoth of these metals look incredibly similar to aluminum. Yet, these metals are used to create the engine pistons. If you identify these metal shavings, it?s almost guaranteed that the pistons are wearing out. However, it?s also possible that the piston rings have broken. 4. AluminumThere are numerous parts of the engine that are constructed from aluminum. Because of this, it can be more difficult to determine what has gone wrong. Look at some of the parts on the engine?s surface. It could be an issue with either the overhead camshaft bearings or the aluminum caps. "
What to Do if There?s Metal in Oil ?	"You probably won?t notice the metal shavings first unless you are doing an oil change. Instead, you might first recognize some performance symptoms that occur as a result of this defect. If the vehicle is exhibiting rough idling or there are unusual sounds coming from the motor, you want to have it looked at. Additionally, the metal shavings can cause a reduction of power or white smoke coming from the tailpipe. Of course, doing an oil change can confirm the presence of metal shavings. If you notice metal in the oil, you need to have the motor looked at by a professional.Most of the time that metal appears in the oil, you are looking at a massive repair or complete engine rebuild. However, if you catch the problem early on, you might be able to walk away with a simpler repair. The key is not to wait at the first sign of trouble."
How Much Does An Oil Leak Repair Cost?	"Repairing an oil leak can cost anywhere from $100 to $2,000 or more. The wide range is due to the numerous causes of an oil leak and can also depend upon the location of the leak. Plus, the type of vehicle you drive has a profound impact on the total costs. If you are taking good care of the engine and performing regular oil changes, there?s less of a chance that you will face major repairs. It?s wise to spend a small amount of money on this maintenance regularly to help avoid costly engine repairs later. "
what are the Common Oil Leak Causes ?	"1. Degraded Oil FilterThe oil filter is responsible for a large number of oil leaks. While it isn?t common, the housing itself can be damaged, causing it to start leaking. Pressure from inside the engine can also cause it to become loose over time, but only if it wasn?t on tight enough in the first place.You can also install the oil filter too tightly, which would cause damage to the gasket. Furthermore, if the old gasket were to stick to the engine during a replacement, it could leak to leaking oil.  This filter is needed to keep contaminants out of the motor oil before damage occurs. For the most part, if you are changing the filter at regular intervals, the filter should continue doing its job, but it?s also possible to get one that?s defective. 2. Failing GasketGaskets are used to keep fluids in the proper areas of the engine. Additionally, gaskets regulate where oil flows as it is transferred throughout the engine.Still, gaskets only have a certain lifespan. They will degrade as time goes on, weakening to the point that oil can seep through. Generally, this shouldn?t happen before 100,000 miles, but it isn?t uncommon if you are hard on the engine. 3. Broken Oil Filler CapIf you see oil puddles form quickly under the car or near the engine, the problem could be the filler cap attached to the valve cover. After many miles, this filler cap can break easily when removed or become loose. There?s also the possibility that the person changing the oil forgot to put the oil filler cap back on after the service. Thankfully, this can be one of the easiest problems to fix. If you can?t re-adjust the cap, you can purchase a new one. 4. Excessive Amount of OilIf you just filled up the oil, it?s possible that a minor error has caused the leak. When you were filling up after the oil change, you might have poured in too much. In this case, removing the excess oil is all you need to do. There?s also the possibility that you spilled some during the process. Use a rag to clean up the mess. 5. Failing Crankshaft SealsAt both ends of the motor, you will see the crankshaft protruding a little bit. At these mounting points, there are seals that keep the oil from coming out of the motor. The crankshaft contains front and rear seals.If the front crankshaft seal is leaking, the oil will be noticeable towards the front of the motor, by the belt.  Otherwise, if you see oil between the engine and the transmission, it could be due to the rear crankshaft seal"
How to Repair an Oil Leak ?	"1. Determine the CauseBecause an oil leak can be caused by many problems, you will need to do some investigative work to find out what?s going on. Get under the car and inspect the seals first. You can also verify that the oil pan plug is installed securely. If you drive an older car, it?s possible you are dealing with multiple oil leaks that have compounded into a bigger problem. 2. Use an AdditiveDepending on the case, an oil leak additive might do the trick. These products condition the rubber seals and can make them more flexible for better retention. However, the additives can take some time to work completely. It?s only wise to try this option if the leak is minimal and you have little time to spare. I always recommend repairing the leak properly instead, however, if you have a very old car not worth throwing money at, you could try it.3. Reference Service ManualBefore you start fixing the oil leak, it?s important to check the service manual for your vehicle. In some cases, you?ll find that the repair is simple to do at home.Other times, the fix might be too complicated for you to do on your own. In these cases, it?s best to seek help from a professional instead. 4. Get to WorkFor many of the easiest repairs, you will only need a few hand tools, a floor jack, jack stands and a torque wrench. Make sure you have all the equipment needed before you get started.If you are securing any bolts, you need to torque them to the appropriate factory specifications. Reference your service manual throughout the repair. 5. Test Drive the VehicleIf you think that the problem is repaired, it?s time to check your work. Check the oil level and top it off if necessary. Next, start the engine and open the hood. While the vehicle is running, check the engine to see if any oil is leaking. Once the vehicle has been running for a short time, you can move it slightly. Watch for any new oil to accumulate in your work area. If there is oil, you need to continue working on the leak. Otherwise, it?s time to take your car out for a test drive to ensure everything seems right. Remember that maintenance is always better than repair and is less costly. If you take care of your engine, you are less likely to deal with oil leaks in the first place."

Synthetic Motor Oils ? Buying Guide ?	"With so many options online, you are practically spoilt for choice. However, not all synthetic motor oils are worth your money. So, before you buy any synthetic motor oil for your vehicle, you must learn more about it. Here is a comprehensive buying guide to help you with your purchase. BrandsYou need to pick the right brand of motor oils first. Going with a new brand that has no previous customer reviews could be a gamble when it comes to your vehicle?s engines. Make sure you only opt for synthetic motor oils from reputed brands online. A few profitable brands that you can consider buying from including Mobil, Valvoline, Castrol, and Royal purple. These brands have made their name in the industry and are now trusted household names. Affordability Most good things come at a price. So, if you want to prioritize your engine?s health, you might have to splurge on this motor oil. Many motor oils that cost less than $20 are generally synthetic blends. They are just as good but inexpensive. On the other hand, synthetic oils over $20 are entirely manufactured and are usually on the steeper end. Their quality is unmatched because of their formulas and purity of blend.  ViscosityViscosity is essentially the thickness of the motor oil you use. It can be measured and written down as 5W-30, 5W-20, and 0W-20. The first digit in this number signifies the viscosity in cold temperatures, and the number at the end denotes consistency in heat. The viscosity of the oil is important because it determines how your engine will perform. Your engine will have to do more work if the motor oil is too thick. So, your motor oils should be consistent and not change too rapidly with temperature changes. AdditivesAdditives are extra components in the synthetic motor oil; this could be anything from corrosion inhibitors, viscosity index improvers, anti-foaming agents, conditioners, detergents, antioxidants, dispersants to anti-wear agents. Do your research well and see what works best for your vehicle.CompatibilityUnderstand what your vehicle engine needs and make sure you give it that. Test both synthetic motor oil and conventional motor oil and see which one has the best effect on your machine. To conclude withSynthetic motor oil has a large number of benefits over traditional oil. You can test it out on your vehicle and see if it works. Be sure to do your research well and pick the right option. The suggestions mentioned above are sure to help you too!"
What brand of synthetic motor oil is best?	"The debate surrounding the best synthetic motor oils is a longstanding one. However, we strongly recommend choosing any of the known brands like Mobil, Valvoline, Castrol, Liqui Moly, and Royal purple."
Is Mobil 1 the best synthetic oil?	"Mobil 1 is absolutely in the top 5 of the best synthetic motor oils you can find on the market. However, if it is really best is just speculation; it depends on your car engine model. Not all engine oils are suitable for all engines."
what are the best 5W30 synthetic oil?	"If you are looking for a great 5W30 synthetic motor oil, you should absolutely look into any of these brands: Mobil, Valvoline, Liqui Moly, Castrol, and Royal purple. We do recommend Castrol or Liqui Moly for most engine types."
Will synthetic oil last 2 years?	"The most so-called ?long-life? synthetic motor oils last up to 2 years or even longer. However, it is not recommended to use them if they are older because they will lose their performance. Check the motor oil specifications for exact information."
Does Motor Oil Expire?	"Yes, motor oil expires over time. However, it is not easy to tell when it is bad. Although you can look at the expiration dates on the bottle, motor oil can also go bad just from sitting in a car engine for too long or when stored improperly.Under optimal conditions, motor oil should remain fairly stable. However, extreme temperatures, synthetic additives and oxidation all play a role in causing it to go bad. The way you store it must also be taken into account. "
How to Know if Motor Oil is Expired ?	"1. Expiration DateThe expiration date printed on the motor oil bottle is a great indicator of how long it will last. The majority of conventional brands determine the shelf life is around five years, while synthetic oils might last seven to eight years or longer. However, this expiration date only applies to unopened bottles that are stored correctly. If you have an opened bottle, the shelf life will be far less. Some manufacturers recommend getting rid of the old oil as soon as it hits the expiration date. In these cases, you would dispose of the oil no matter how it looks. 2. ColorCheck Motor Oil DipstickWhen engine oil is fresh, it has an amber color to it. After an oil change, you should be able to pull the dipstick out and see this natural color. That?s why when you check the oil and see it darkened or black, you know it?s probably time to change it. (except diesel engines) Oxidation is what causes the oil to lose its fresh color. Additionally, it becomes contaminated with moisture and dirt inside the engine, causing it to break down over time. Even the opened bottle of oil can turn this color while sitting on the shelf. If dust infiltrates the bottle, it can become darker than normal, indicating that the oil is bad and should be discarded. Aside from the color, fresh oil should be translucent and clear. There should be no haze or milky appearance to it. 3. ConsistencyWhen you pour fresh oil, it should flow clean and with ease. If you notice any separation, it?s possible that the oil has been contaminated.Additionally, oil that becomes thick and solid is no good. You don?t want motor oil to have a slimy consistency because it?s not going to protect the car engine. "
How Long Does Motor Oil Last?	"An unopened motor oil bottle lasts for approximately 5 years, or until the expiration date on the bottle expires. If the oil is already in the engine, you should follow the manufacturer?s schedule for how often it should be changed. It is usually every year or every two years.1. Unopened on ShelfMotor oil is going to last far longer when it sits unopened. That?s why it?s so important to leave it closed until you are ready to use it. Most brands put a suggestion on the bottle, helping you determine what the appropriate expiration date is.In many cases, conventional oil might last five years. On the other hand, you could get seven to eight years out of the unopened synthetic oil if it is stored properly.Generally, you want to use the oil as soon as possible. The older it gets, the more likely it is to degrade and lose its lubricating abilities.  2. Half-used on ShelfThe expiration date listed on the motor oil bottle is meant for when it remains unopened. Once you crack open the bottle, the expiration date becomes dramatically reduced. You can no longer expect to get five to eight years out of a bottle of oil if it is unsealed.Instead, you should plan to use the oil within a year of opening it. This guideline stands true whether you use conventional or synthetic motor oil. As the air hits the oil, efficiency and lubrication all become degraded. Plus, oxidation becomes the main concern with an open bottle. If oxidation occurs, the oil can accumulate sludge and sediment, making it ineffective in the car engine. 3. In EngineIf you are driving the car regularly, you only have to worry about changing the oil at regular intervals. Pushing it beyond the recommended maintenance schedule could lead to contamination harming the engine. However, if you store your vehicle or you haven?t driven for a while, you need to be concerned with how long the oil is good for. Oil that remains stagnant in the motor faces the same issues as the opened bottle on the shelf. It will oxidize and allow the buildup of sediment. If you run this old oil in the engine, it can cause permanent damage. "
Is It Safe to Use Expired Motor Oil?	"Whether the oil on the shelf has reached its expiration date or you let it sit in the car engine too long, you should dispose of it and use fresh oil instead. It?s never worth running old oil in the engine, especially when you consider the cost.Oil that contains an excessive amount of acid or houses contaminates is only going to damage the internal metal parts. Repairing this damage could mean costly garage bills that you don?t want to deal with. When in doubt, dispose of the oil properly and get a fresh bottle. "
How to Store Motor Oil ?	"1. Use Original ContainerThe best way to store your motor oil is in the container it came in. Keep the bottle unopened until you have no other option.Even after you open it, it?s best to leave it in the container you bought it in. The manufacturer knows how best to store the motor oil, so you can trust the packaging. By transferring it into another container, you open the door for contamination from dirt and dust. 2. Keep in Dry LocationYou should always keep the bottles of oil in a dry location. Moisture is one of the biggest enemies of motor oil. When you open the bottle, it?s more susceptible to moisture and water vapor. When the air hits the oil, oxidation begins. Additionally, moisture can condense inside the bottle if the conditions are humid. The lower the oil levels are in the container, the higher the risk becomes because there is more surface room for condensation to begin. 3. Watch the TemperatureAll motor oil should be stored between 32- and 85-degrees Fahrenheit. It doesn?t matter if you have an open or unopened bottle; you want it in these temperatures. It?s also helpful if the temperatures remain consistent while in storage. The fewer fluctuations, the longer the oil will last. If the motor oil is subject to extreme temperatures, it will begin breaking down, causing a change to the viscosity. As it breaks down, it is no longer capable of lubricating the engine the way it should."
Why My Car is Leaking Oil ?	"The most common reason a car is leaking motor oil is due to a leaking oil drain plug or a leaking oil filter. It can also be caused by a bad valve cover gasket, damaged oil pan, or clogged crankcase ventilation.These are just the most common reasons, and far from all of them. There could be many different causes and locations of the engine oil leak, so it needs to be visually inspected before replacing any parts.Here is a more detailed list of the most common possible reasons for an oil leak.1. Damaged or Rusty Oil FilterEngine Oil FilterA faulty or damaged oil filter is sometimes the culprit that causes the oil leak. Check the oil filter to see if it is tightened properly and there are no signs of rust on it. If you find rust on it, it is definitely time to replace both your engine oil and the filter.The leak can often also come from the O-ring sealing. However, these can be difficult to replace separately, and you may need to replace the whole oil filter.Please note that the oil filter should be changed every time the oil is changed.2. Leaking Oil Drain PlugOil Drain PlugThe oil drain plug is located at the bottom of the oil sump and is accessible from the vehicle?s underside. A worn or damaged drain plug can cause the oil to leak.The oil plug sealing or the whole oil drain plug should be replaced every oil change. However, most people skip this and install the old drain plug again. This can cause the oil plug O-ring to leak.Check and make sure the oil plug is tightened properly, and if it looks like it is leaking from the plug, you might have to replace the gasket or the whole plug.3. Bad Valve Cover GasketValve Cover And GasketValve covers are located on the top of the engine cylinder head and serve as a seal to prevent oil leakage. The valve cover gaskets tend to wear out after some time because of the heat and the effect that rubbers are getting hardened over time so that oil may drip from them.The valve cover gaskets are often visible from the outside of the engine, and it is pretty easy to see if the leak comes from there. However, sometimes it can come from the engine?s backside, and you can use a mirror to try to locate any oil leaks from there.4. Damaged or Rusty Oil PanCar Oil PanThe oil pan is located at the bottom of the engine. It will be damaged over time as debris hits the bottom of the pan and leaves dents.If you have an aluminum oil pan, there is a risk that you hit something under the car, which caused cracks in the oil pan where the oil leaks from.If you have a steel oil pan, it is possible that it started to rust for a long time, and after a while, you got a super small rust hole in the pan, which cause the leak.The leak can also come from the oil pan gasket or the oil pan sealant.5. Clogged crankcase ventilationCrankcase VentilationThe crankcase ventilation makes sure that the car?s compression will not cause an overpressure inside the crankcase.The crankcase is often ventilated through a valve and a hose going to the intake again.If the crankcase ventilation is clogged, it can cause overpressure in the engine, and this can be the main reason for several different oil leaks in your car because the oil is trying to find a way out of the engine.This can easily be identifiable by loosening the oil cap while the engine is at idle. If everything works fine, it should be a slight underpressure there. However, if there is high overpressure there, it might be caused by clogged crankcase ventilation.6. Damaged Head GasketHead GasketIf the head gasket is damaged, it can cause oil leaks into the combustion chamber or the coolant system.However, if there is a leak from the oil pressure channels near the edge of the head gasket, it can also cause external oil leaks on your engine.This is not very common, but it absolutely happens. If it looks like the oil is coming from between the engine block and the cylinder head, it is definitely time to take a look at the head gasket.7. Crankshaft or camshaft SealsCrankshaft SealAround the crankshaft and the camshaft, seals hold the engine oil inside the engine. As you can imagine, the crankshaft and camshafts are always spinning, and this can cause the sealings to wear out.The crankshaft has sealings both on the front of the engine, behind the crankshaft pulley, and against the gearbox. If you can see the oil leaking from the gearbox housing, it is likely coming from the crankshaft seal.The camshaft does often only have sealings on the front of the engine.8. Leaking Oil CoolerEngine Oil CoolerThere are two types of oil coolers. Either you have one that is cooled by air, which is often located in the car?s front. The other one is a coolant-cooled oil cooler, which is often located on the engine block.Commonly, the oil leak is coming from the coolant-coolant type as they often have sealings against the engine block. They are often made of plastic, which can result in cracks of the plastic, which can result in leaks.Also, the air-cooled ones in the front can leak, so if you see any oil leaks in front of the engine, it is probably coming from the engine oil cooler.9. Leaking Oil pressure sensorOil Pressure SensorThe oil pressure sensor is often located in the cylinder head or at the engine block. This sensor is often made of plastic, which can cause it to crack and leak within time.It is often pretty easy to replace once you locate it, and it is often very affordable.10. Cracked Cylinder Head or Engine BlockEngine BlockThis is not common, but it could happen, so it should not be forgotten. If the engine cylinder head or the engine block is cracked, oil can leak from the engine and even enter the cooling system.This can especially happen if you, by some time, didn?t have enough coolant in the cooling system, which caused the coolant to freeze.If your cylinder head is cracked, you often have to replace the whole head. If there is a cracked engine block or rust wholes, it is possible to weld it in some rare situations, but often you need to replace the whole engine."
How to Prevent Oil Leakages?	"Regular maintenance and routine oil service are sufficient to keep your car?s engine in good condition and prevent any oil leakage.It is vital to clean the crankcase ventilation hoses and the control valves sometimes to keep a slight underpressure in your car?s engine. Overpressure will tear on the sealings and create oil leaks.You can also use special additives that are effective and help to prevent oil leaks. If you want to look at one of these additives, you can find it here at Amazon.If you notice other symptoms and the problem does not occur in the above-mentioned areas, we advise you to take the car to an authorized dealer for inspection."
what are Conventional Oil?	"Conventional oil is the type that has been around the longest. It is time-tested and shown to protect most vehicles in normal driving conditions.The conventional oil comes from crude petroleum, designed to keep the engine clean from contaminants while minimizing moisture and improving the lubrication. All major brands manufacture conventional oil, so it is easy to find. However, conventional oil might not provide the best fuel economy and it can allow carbon or sludge buildup over time. That?s why it?s important to change this type of oil more frequently. "
what are Synthetic Blend Oil?	"Synthetic blend oil mixes full synthetic with conventional oil to combine the best of two worlds. While it contains some conventional oil, there are also some additives, such as those found in synthetic formulations.You can expect a slightly better performance from this oil without spending top dollar. However, it?s difficult to determine how much of the synthetic formulation is added to the petroleum base because the ratio is different between brands. In general, the synthetic blend is going to offer better fuel economy than conventional oil but won?t perform as well as full synthetic. Additionally, you will receive slightly better protection from carbon and sludge than if you choose conventional oil."
what are Full Synthetic Oil?	"Synthetic oil has been manufactured with special additives, causing it to be the most expensive of the three options. While there are no set standards about the refining process, you can guarantee better performance than compared with conventional oils.Some synthetics are still made from the petroleum base, but it is extremely modified to provide high-performance qualities. You can find manufacturers that use the natural form and tweak it with special additives, while others will create the entire formula from manufactured compounds. Full synthetic oil has a lower viscosity than conventional oil. Because of less friction, fuel economy is improved and more power can be unleashed from the engine. You can also use most synthetic oils in any climate, providing superior cold starts and great lubrication in the summer. Finally, synthetic oil doesn?t break down the same way that conventional oil does. For this reason, the changing interval is longer, allowing you to perform oil changes less frequently. When choosing synthetic oil, you have to take a look at the formulation as each manufacturer does it differently. You can find varieties with detergents, corrosion inhibitors, anti-foaming agents, dispersants, anti-oxidants and viscosity index improvers. "
how to Choose the Right Motor Oil ?	"Always check your repair manual to use the right motor oil with the correct specs in your car engine. Using the wrong engine oil type can damage your engine and the warranty may not cover it.1. CostIf you need to save some cash, conventional oil might be your top choice. One quart might cost you as little as $3. You can also choose conventional oil from any of the top manufacturers.At the other end of the spectrum, full synthetic is going to cost the most. You can expect to pay a minimum of $8 per quart. Of course, buying it by the gallon will help you save a little dough.The best option for most people is to choose a synthetic blend instead. It?s slightly more expensive than the conventional, at about $4-7 per quart, but it offers some of the benefits of the costly options. 2. Changing IntervalsConventional oil is going to break down faster than any other type. That?s why conventional oil changes must take place every 3,000 miles in most vehicles. While the cost is low for the oil, when you look at the per-mile expense, it no longer seems like much of a bargain.Some synthetic oil is rated for up to 15,000 miles of use. However, this recommendation doesn?t take into account how long the oil filter is rated for, so that?s something to consider. Many people running a synthetic blend or full synthetic prefer to change their oil between 5,000 and 10,000 miles. 3. ProtectionThere?s no question that synthetic and blends are going to protect the engine over the long haul. Conventional oil simply doesn?t have the additives to perform at the same level. With that in mind, is synthetic oil better than a blend? Both motor oils are going to provide protection, ensuring that the engine gets what it needs. However, full synthetic is more efficient. You can expect a more calibrated formula designed for your driving purposes. At the end of the day, it comes down to deciding how much you are willing to spend to protect your vehicle?s engine."
What Are The Symptoms Of Low Oil Pressure?	"The main symptoms of low oil pressure include:Oil pressure light on dashboardBad noises from engineCheck engine lightSeized EngineHere is a more detailed list of the signs of low oil pressure to look for:1. Oil pressure light on dashboardLow Oil Pressure LightThe first thing you will notice if your car has low oil pressure is the warning light on your dashboard.The oil pressure sensor is monitoring the oil pressure all the time when the engine is running. If the oil pressure gets too low or too high, it will light up the oil pressure light.Remember that a faulty oil pressure sensor can give false signals to the dashboard.2. Bad Noises from engineCar Engine NoiseThe other widespread symptoms of low oil pressure are rattling and other strange noises from the engine. The oil pressure prevents engine parts in the engine from rubbing metal against metal, and if the oil pressure is low, they will start rubbing against each other.This can create a horrible sound, and if you hear this, you should turn off your engine immediately.3. Check engine lightCheck Engine LightThe oil pressure also controls tensioners like the timing belt or timing chain tensioner. It can also control different pumps like the fuel pump if you have a diesel engine.For example, if the oil pressure is low and the chain tensioner won?t tension the timing chain, the camshaft timing will be off, and the check engine light will turn on.4. Seized EngineWhite Smoke EngineThis is the last and the worst symptom. You never want this to happen. If you drove your car with rattling noises and an oil pressure light on your dashboard until it stopped working, your engine has probably seized.A car engine that has seized after running on too low oil pressure is often not possible to repair. It is unfortunately often cheaper to replace the whole engine."
what the Causes of Low oil pressure ?	"The most common cause of low oil pressure is too little oil in the engine. It could also be caused by issues like the wrong engine oil type, a clogged oil pickup tube, or a damaged oil pump. You should always check the oil level and quality first.Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of low oil pressure.1. Low oil levelOil Level Low LightIf you have low oil pressure at idle, make sure that your engine?s oil level is correct. Check the oil dipstick and make sure it?s not under the MIN mark.Modern cars often have an oil level sensor. If you see a yellow oil can light on your dashboard, it means that your oil pressure is light.This can also be recognized if the oil pressure light appears while you are turning your car. This means the oil is pressed to the engine?s side, and if the oil level is low, the oil pump will suck air instead.If you have a low oil level, the oil pump can suck up air from the sump and make a low and fluctuating oil pressure.If you do not know how to check your engine?s oil, check your repair manual or leave a comment below.2. Wrong type of engine oil for your engineEngine Oil TypeThe oil you use in your engine could cause low oil pressure for your engine, especially at idle. If you are using 0w-20 oil in an engine that requires 5w-50 oil, you could get a low oil pressure when the engine is hot.Some engines have a larger bearing clearance and require a thicker oil to get the correct oil pressure at idle.If you have low oil pressure and suspect that you have the wrong oil in your car, check your repair manual of what oil you should have and make an oil and oil filter change.3. Dirty pickup to the oil pumpVw Oil Pressure HiccupIf your oil level is correct, and you are sure that the oil type is correct, the most common cause of low oil pressure is too much dirt in the pickup to the oil pump.Normally the oil pump takes the oil from the bottom of the oil pan from a pipe. Before that pipe, there is often a net that will prevent any big metal pieces from going through the oil pump.That filter/net could catch a lot of dirt and may have to be cleaned. To check this, you have to remove the oil pan from your vehicle and inspect the oil pickup.4. Damaged oil pumpOil Pressure InsideIf the oil pickup filter looks fine, there could be some damage to your oil pump. Diagnosing whether your oil pump is damaged is not very easy, and it?s often pretty hard to replace the oil pump. If you are lucky, the oil pump is fitted inside the oil pan with a chain to the crankshaft, and then it is much easier to replace.If you are not familiar with cars, you should let a mechanic diagnose the issue to see if it?s a faulty oil pump. Ask your authorized dealer or check your repair manual to find out where the oil pump is located and how hard it is to replace it.5. An internal oil leak or damaged bearingsBad Rod BearingIn rare cases, there could be an internal oil leak inside your engine. It will make your oil pressure low, and it could leak from a crack or a bad internal gasket.Another problem could be that your crankshaft bearings are already gone, but usually, you will hear a nasty noise from the engine if the bearings are gone. These problems are not very easy to diagnose yourself if you are not a skilled mechanic."
How to check the oil pressure?	"The best way to check your car?s oil pressure is to install a manual oil pressure gauge temporarily.The easiest way to connect your manual oil pressure gauge is often to remove the oil pressure switch and get or make your own adapter to the oil pressure gauge to fit in the hole for the oil pressure switch.Check the repair manual for your car to see which oil pressures you can expect on your car model at the given RPM.If you have checked your pressure with a mechanical gauge and confirmed that the oil pressure is low, follow the guide of causes above one more time and then consult a mechanic if you can?t solve the problem."
What Causes Metal Shavings in Oil?	"The most common reason for copper metal shavings in motor oil is bad rod bearings or main bearings. If it?s aluminum or metal, it could come from the pistons, a faulty oil pump, or worn camshafts.Motor oil is necessary for proper engine lubrication and to keep the parts working as they should. Without this lubrication, the metal parts would grind together, thereby reducing the life of the motor. Sometimes, the speed of the pistons and a lack of lubrication can cause some metal debris to come off of the internal components. In a few instances, this wouldn?t be a big deal as the metallic particles were caught in the filter and removed during a tune-up. However, if an abundance of metal shavings are showing up in the oil, it indicates that the metal components inside are chipping away. "
what are the Different Metal Shavings Types ?	"1. Iron ShavingsIf the shavings you see in the oil are iron, you have an issue with one of the rotating parts inside the engine. The camshaft and crankshaft are both constructed of iron.Plus, various valve train parts can be made from iron. Either way, you are facing a serious repair that shouldn?t be delayed. 2. Brass, Bronze or Copper ShavingsBronze, copper, and brass all have a unique appearance that is undeniably different from the rest. If you notice these colored shavings in the oil, you might be dealing with a worn-out busings.The trouble might also come from a defective bearing inside the engine. While these parts are small, both spell big trouble for your engine when they fail. 3. Chromium or Molybdenum ShavingsThis silvery gray color shaving can also look similar to aluminum. However, chromium and molybdenum are what the pistons are made from.When you see these shavings, you can almost bet that the pistons are worn out. There might also be piston ring breakage occurring. 4. Aluminum ShavingsThese shavings tend to occur because of wear on the surface of the engine. There are several worn-out components that can cause aluminum shavings. It?s possible that you are dealing with the overhead camshaft bearings. Otherwise, it might be due to the aluminum caps."
What Problems are Caused by Metal Shavings in Oil?	"1. Rough IdleWhen your vehicle is idling, everything should be smooth. However, vibration or shaking during idle could indicate that there are metal shavings in the oil.When there isn?t enough lubrication for the engine components, the metal pieces begin to rub together. Over time, metal chunks fall off and end up in the oil. The rough idle is simply a symptom of the engine not running as it should.2. Engine NoisesWhen the engine doesn?t get the right amount of lubrication, you will likely notice some strange sounds. Because oil isn?t moving freely in the engine, you could start to hear some ticking noises.In some cases, these sounds are present all of the time. Other times, you are only going to hear ticking when you first start up the vehicle. 3. Engine KnockAn engine knock is a common sign of motor failure. It can be caused if you neglected regular oil and filter changes. The longer you allow contamination to build up in the oil, the more stress the internal components are put under. Engine knock should always be taken seriously and looked at before the motor fails on you. 4. Poor AccelerationDecreased performance is always an indication that something is wrong with the engine. If you are stepping on the accelerator pedal but aren?t seeing a response, you should take notice.Decreased engine power means that the motor can?t work as it should. It might be under additional stress from the contaminated oil. 5. Dashboard Warning LightsYou might also notice a Check Engine Light comes on, or you might see the oil pressure warning indicator. In some vehicles, there will be a Service Engine Soon or Oil Change Reminder light up on the dashboard. Additionally, there are some alerts that the vehicle might be dealing with reduced power. When you see an indicator, it?s a sign that you should have the vehicle looked at right away. "
How to Fix My Car When You Find Metal Shavings in Oil ?	"If there are very few metal shavings in the motor oil, then there is often not a problem, wear and tear over time. However, there are many of them, and it happens after a short oil change; you may have an issue with your engine.While you hope that fixing engine problems would be cheap and easy, it isn?t usually the case. However, the longer you let anything go, the more expensive it can become. What might be a simple fix, such as performing a quick oil change, can quickly turn into a complete engine replacement. Take your car to the mechanic for a full inspection. They will be able to tell what sort of damage has been done and if it is repairable. In some cases, a part can be replaced, while at other times, an engine rebuild might be a better solution. Rebuilding the engine can get quite costly. You will probably pay $2,000 or more, depending on what type of vehicle you drive. However, the engine rebuild gives you numerous new parts with the motor. To perform a rebuild, the following will occur:Engine covers, hardware and valves are removed.Pistons and rings will be removed and repaired.New gaskets and seals are added. Any other issues can be addressed at the same time. If you drive a small, compact car, an engine rebuild shouldn?t take long. However, if you have a pickup or SUV with a large V8 engine, it?s going to take some time. However, with proper engine maintenance and regular oil changes, you won?t ever need to worry about metal shavings in the motor."
What Causes my Car Engine To Burn Oil?	"The most common reason why a car is burning oil is worn seals or gaskets. It can also be caused by clogged crankcase ventilation resulting in overpressure inside the engine, which will cause the oil to slip through the piston rings into the combustion chamber.Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of why a car engine is burning oil.1. Worn Seals or GasketsCar Oil LeakWhen the car has damaged or worn-out crankshaft seals or a valve cover gasket, it could be leaking oil. With this defect, oil is lost every time you drive, requiring you to top off the levels to keep the oil where it needs to be.If you notice gaskets or seals that are worn out, you want to have them replaced immediately. In many cases, it can be quite inexpensive, but it helps you avoid costly engine repairs later. Failed gaskets will lead to an external oil leak, and this is usually quite easy to locate, as there is likely to be an oil pool under your car after you?ve parked it.2. Clogged crankcase ventilationPcv ValveWhen the crankcase ventilation or the PCV valve is clogged, it can cause overpressure inside the crankcase, which will push oil out of the motor through the sealings.To fix it, locate the crankcase ventilation hoses and the PCV valve, and make sure the air can move freely out from the engine. The crankcase ventilation often has several hoses going to the engine, so it is important to check all of them.3. Poor or Wrong Oil QualityCar Motor OilUsing the right type of oil is imperative for a well-running engine. Make sure you follow the manufacturer?s recommendations when choosing what oil to use.Additionally, you want to change the oil regularly. When the oil becomes old and dirty, it can no longer lubricate the metal components inside the motor. This excessive friction is going to cause the engine to consume more oil. Check the engine oil to see what color it is. It should be tan or yellow-tinted. If it is black or dark brown and you have a gas engine, you have waited too long to perform an oil change. Diesel engine oil will get black directly after a change. With an oil filter, drain pan, wrench and new oil, you can have it changed in twenty minutes. 4. Defective Piston RingsPiston RingsWhen the piston rings become damaged or worn out, oil can seep through into the internal combustion chamber. Not only will this lead to oil burning, but carbon deposits can also start to form on the cylinders and piston rings.You will notice the oil levels start to drop. However, the only solution to this problem is to replace the piston rings. 5. High Oil PressureWith high oil pressure, the fluid floods through the engine in excess. When the oil falls into the cylinders, it is likely to burn up.To solve this problem, you need to figure out what is causing the high oil pressure. The issue could be caused by a defect with the central computer, or you might have added too much oil during the last service. 6. Old, Worn-out EngineDuring the first five years of an engine?s life, nothing major should go wrong. During these early years, oil shouldn?t be consumed excessively, and you shouldn?t have to worry much about burning. Once the miles rack up, seals and gaskets start to break down and deteriorate. Small leaks can start, and the engine will consume more oil. Additionally, an older engine might have bigger tolerances that permit oil to flow through spots that don?t exist with newer models. "
Is Burning Oil Considered Normal?	"Oil burning is something commonly discussed among automotive owners, but manufacturers rarely provide information about the issue. Because of this, what might be considered a normal condition for one engine could be considered excessive with the next. As an example, BMW informs drivers that some engines burn about a quart of oil within a thousand miles. Additionally, GM states that normal consumption is anything that is below a quart within 2,000 miles, as long as the vehicle is maintained and driven correctly. If your engine is using more than a quart of oil between the oil changes, it?s definitely something that should be looked at. "
How to Fix Excessive Oil Consumption ?	"In general, a lot of the causes can be prevented simply by maintaining the vehicle and paying attention to any signs of trouble. You also want to make sure you are using the right oil type for your vehicle. Check the owner?s manual to make sure you have the right viscosity.If you notice any leaks, you want to repair them as soon as possible. In many cases, replacing a gasket or seal won?t cost you a lot and can save you a lot of trouble. As the engine begins to age, you might want to upgrade to something newer before engine troubles set in. When you price the cost of replacing an engine versus the expense to upgrade, you will see the benefits. It?s best to sell your vehicle while it is still worth something, especially if you want to use the money as a down payment on something newer."
what iare the Symptoms Of A Bad Oil Pump ?	"The most common symptom of a bad oil pump is a low oil pressure warning light on your dashboard. You may also notice that your engine has become noisier than usual. You can hear this by opening the hood at idle and listening for any metallic noises.There are not many different symptoms, as you may notice, but the symptoms that do exist can be very strong indicators.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing oil pump to look for:1. Low Oil Pressure/Oil Pressure Warning LightEngine Oil Pressure LightYour oil pump is what pressurizes your oil system, so it makes sense that as it starts to fail, your vehicle?s oil pressure will drop. Keep in mind that it?s unlikely that the entire oil pump will fail at once, so it?s more likely that you?ll have low oil pressure instead of no oil pressure.If your engine doesn?t have an oil pressure gauge, it should have an oil pressure warning light. As soon as this light turns on, you need to stop driving. Low oil pressure can quickly lead to severe engine damage that can cost you thousands of dollars.Until you fix the cause of your low oil pressure, you shouldn?t drive your vehicle ? even to the mechanic?s shop. Opt for a tow instead.2. Increased Engine TemperatureOverheating Engine E1609789863111If your vehicle?s oil pump isn?t moving the oil around the engine as it should, one of the first things you?re going to notice is a spike in your engine?s temperature.While there should be other symptoms to accompany this, like engine noise or an oil pressure warning light, a faulty oil pump will cause your engine to overheat if you keep driving.3. Engine NoisesCheck Noise Under Hood E1609791600132There are multiple places where your engine could be making noises if the oil pump stops working. While one of the most common locations is the oil pump itself, it?s also not uncommon to hear noises coming from the valve train.The valve train uses oil to keep everything lubricated, and without it, you?ll have metal rubbing on metal without any lubrication. Not only will this quickly cause damage, but it will also create horrendous noises too.4. The Vehicle Won?t StartHard StartingMany newer model vehicles have a low oil pressure switch that?s tied directly to your vehicle?s ignition. If this switch detects that your oil pump isn?t working correctly, it might keep your engine from starting in the first place!This acts as a way to protect your engine from damage as you struggle to figure out what?s going on. It?s a feature designed to protect you from yourself, because many drivers try to limp their vehicle to the shop if it has a problem, and with low oil pressure, this can create thousands of dollars in repairs.However, the low oil pressure switch feature that keeps your engine from starting is almost always exclusive to newer vehicles. So, if you?re driving something a little older, you?ll need to take precautions yourself to prevent engine damage.If you have been driving with low oil pressure long enough that the engine has stopped and it will not crank anymore, you have run into some major problems which may result in an engine replacement."
what is the  Function of Oil Pump ?	"While the motor oil itself has tons of functions, the oil pump?s purpose is a little more straightforward. It takes oil from the oil pan and pushes it throughout your engine. By pushing oil through the engine, it pressurizes everything and lets the oil do its job.Almost all oil pumps are crankshaft-driven, so as soon as your engine starts up, the oil pump should kick in."
Oil Pump Location	"Your vehicle?s oil pump is typically located inside your vehicle?s oil pan. It generally sits towards the top of the pan and uses a pickup tube to take oil from the pan and push it through the engine. In some engines, it is also located around the crankshaft at the front of it.Because of the location, you?ll need to drop the oil pan to reach it, which adds a little more time and complexity to the job. Even worse, you need to remove the front main cover for many vehicles, which often requires removing and reinstalling a ton more parts."
how to test car Oil Pump  ?	"Testing your car's oil pump is an important part of diagnosing low oil pressure issues. Here's how you can test your car's oil pump:Make sure your car is parked on a level surface and the engine is cool.Locate the oil pressure gauge or light on your dashboard.Start the engine and let it idle for a few minutes to warm up the oil.Observe the oil pressure gauge or light on your dashboard. If your car has a gauge, it should show a reading between 25-60 PSI (pounds per square inch) at idle, depending on the make and model of your car. If your car has a light, it should go off after a few seconds of the engine starting.If the oil pressure gauge shows low pressure or the oil pressure light stays on, turn off the engine immediately to avoid damage to your engine.Remove the oil pressure sending unit using a wrench. This is typically located on the engine block or near the oil filter.Attach a mechanical oil pressure gauge to the oil pressure port using a special adapter.Start the engine and let it idle. Observe the mechanical oil pressure gauge reading.Compare the mechanical gauge reading to the reading on your dashboard gauge or light. If the mechanical gauge reading is within the manufacturer's recommended range and your dashboard gauge or light is still showing low pressure, then the issue may be with your dashboard gauge or sensor.If the mechanical gauge reading is low, then the oil pump may be faulty. In this case, it's best to have your car inspected by a mechanic to determine the cause of the low oil pressure.It's important to regularly check your car's oil pressure and address any issues promptly to avoid serious engine damage."
what is the Oil Pump Replacement Cost ?	"The average oil pump replacement cost is between $300 and $2500, depending on the car model and labor costs. Expect 100$ to 500$ in parts and 200$ to 2000$ in labor costs.The cost to replace an oil pump varies a bit. For starters, you?ll need the new oil pump, which runs anywhere from $50 to $150. However, you?ll also need a new oil pan gasket and likely a new front main gasket.Depending on how the manufacturer designed the front main, you might end up replacing all the gaskets associated with a top-end rebuild. The price for all these different gaskets adds up, and you?ll probably end up spending close to $150 to $200 on gaskets alone.From there, you?ll need a new oil and an oil filter, and if you have to remove the front main seal, you?ll need new coolant as well. Both these fluids will cost you another $100 to $150.Finally, you?ll need to account for all the labor associated with this. This can vary as well since the number of components you?ll need to remove changes from vehicle to vehicle.Because of this, it will typically take a mechanic anywhere from four to eight hours to complete the repairs. This leaves a pretty extensive price range from $200 to $800.Just remember that the more complicated the labor, the more you?ll save by doing it yourself, but it will also be a bigger headache."
What does a bad oil pump sound like?	"A bad oil pump will in most cases not cause noise from the oil pump itself, however, a bad oil pump will cause the oil pressure to drop. This drop in oil pressure will cause the engine to be much noisier than usual, and if you hear a metallic sound coming from the engine, you need to turn the engine off and fix it as soon as possible."
Can I drive with a bad oil pump?	"No. Driving with a bad oil pump can cause the engine to completely seize up and destroy the engine. A bad oil pump can cause low oil pressure, which is fatal to a car engine in both the short and long term."
How do you check a car oil pump?	"The easiest way to check the operation of a car oil pump is to connect a manual oil pressure gauge and check the oil pressure. Getting to the oil pump for a visual inspection is often quite a project, so checking the oil pressure is sufficient in most cases."
Will a bad oil pump make a knocking noise?	"Yes. A bad oil pump will cause a drop in oil pressure, which can create engine noise. If you?re hearing a knocking noise due to a bad oil pump, chances are you?re hearing rod knocks, which could mean an expensive repair bill. Therefore, you should never run the engine with a bad oil pump."
What?s The Difference Between 10W30 and 10W40 Oil?	"The main difference is that the 10W40 oil is thicker than the 10W30 oil at higher temperatures. Both have almost the same characteristics, and the only difference is the oil viscosity.Sadly, that quick answer probably doesn?t make it much easier to understand. You will first need to know what oil viscosity is and what the numbers of both motor oils mean. Let?s take a quick look at that first."
what is the  Oil Viscosity?	"When discussing viscosity, you know that it relates to the thickness of a liquid. For example, oil is thicker than water. If you were to pour out water and oil at the same rate, the water would flow faster. Because of this, oil has a higher viscosity than water.Viscosity is affected by multiple factors, especially when it comes to different grades of motor oil. One such factor is temperature. If you were to put your oil in the refrigerator over many days, it would eventually turn into a wax substance. Because this is true, you know that oil viscosity and temperature are closely related. As the temperature increases, oil viscosity decreases. In return, when temperature decreases, oil viscosity increases. The two are proportional. Your car?s motor requires the right viscosity of oil to run correctly. The oil needs to handle various temperatures, able to adapt to whatever situation it is in. If your engine is producing an excessive amount of heat, the oil could quickly become too thin and fail to protect the inner components. On the other hand, if the engine is cold, oil could become too thick to flow properly. That?s where the oil grades come in. Each is named based on its viscosity and how it will operate. "
what is the  Oil Grade ?	"Both of these oils start with the number 10. This first number indicates the viscosity of oil at low temperatures. Usually, this number is designated for winter temperatures. As this first number goes lower, it flows easier in cold weather. Therefore, oils starting with the number 5 pour out faster than those with a 10 designation. As you might expect, W stands for winter. So, what does the second number in the oil grade indicate? It shows how easily the motor oil flows when running at optimal engine temperatures or during the hotter months of the year. The higher this number is, the more protection the oil provides when dealing with extreme heat and pressure. With this in mind, the only difference between 10W30 and 10W40 oil is the viscosity during higher temperatures and more pressure. 10W40 is going to be thicker when the temperatures rise."
When I use 10W30 Oil ?	"If you live in a cold climate, you will find that 10W30 works better for your vehicle. In these climates, the motor oil is only dealing with the engine heat, not added stress from the environment. 10W30 motor oil can also reduce engine temperatures while it heats up during the winter.You will find that 10W30 is used more often than 10W40. It is also easier to find and lower-cost. If you are looking for an economical solution, you might prefer 10W30. However, you don?t want to use it if you live in hot climates or it is the middle of a warm summer. "
When I Use 10W40 Oil ?	"If you live where it is hot year-round, you will prefer 10W40 motor oil. It?s designed to operate better at hotter temperatures and protects your engine from wear in the extremes. Not only will this oil handle the environmental heat better, but it?s also designed for engines that get hotter than others.With this in mind, you could still add 10W30 in warm weather, but you must know that it is going to thin out quicker than 10W40. As the temperatures continue to rise, it might not lubricate the internal components as well. To be safe, spend a little more and use 10W40 for better protection at high temperatures. "
is it wrong to Mixing 10W30 and 10W40 Motor Oils ?	"If you search online about mixing oils, you will get a lot of people telling you it is okay. However, it is advised against because of multiple reasons.First, mixing motor oil grades can create an oil pressure decrease as the engine revs higher. This problem could cause a bearing to go bad due to spinning. Additionally, when you mix engine oils, you can void your vehicle?s warranty. While both function the same in cold temperatures, the one is designed to be thicker in warmer climates. Unless there is an emergency, you don?t want to mix the oil grades and cause additional wear on your engine. By carrying motor oil with you, this situation can be avoided. "
How Much is an Oil Change?	"The average oil change cost is between $50 and $200 if you let a professional do it. Cost is determined by the type of oil used, the amount of oil needed, and the location where you take the vehicle. Oil changes are not expensive, whether you do them yourself or take the vehicle to a shop.This small cost is nothing compared to what you might spend by neglecting regular engine maintenance. If you perform the oil change yourself, your expenses remain extremely low.By putting out this minimal amount now, you reduce the chances that you will need major engine repair later. Consider the regular oil change as an insurance policy keeping you from dealing with engine replacement or repairs. "
what are the Factors Determining Oil Change Cost ?	"1. Motor Oil TypeThe oil you use will have a dramatic impact on the overall cost. In general, there are four types of oil to choose from. Conventional oil is the most basic and traditional type. It?s the least expensive and is produced by simply refining the crude oil.Full synthetic oil uses a crude oil that has been refined, but it?s also be purified and distilled. With this base, chemically produced materials are added, such as petroleum formulations. Synthetic oil is considered a man-made lubricant that provides the best protection for the engine. However, it?s also the most expensive option. New vehicles and those with a turbo engine benefit the most from these oils.The synthetic blend oil mixes the properties of synthetic with conventional. Because of the formulation, it can provide many benefits of the synthetic type but doesn?t have an excessive cost associated with it. Finally, high mileage oil is a type used for engines that contain 75,000 miles or more. Additives are included in the formulation to reduce friction and corrosion. The typical high-mileage oil can be synthetic, a blend or conventional, but it always has the added properties. 2. Engine SizeThe oil change cost depends heavily on how much lubricant is needed. If you have a larger engine, you will need to use more oil than if you have a smaller motor.Most four-cylinder motors are going to use about five quarts of oil. Additionally, a six-cylinder engine often holds six quarts, while the eight-cylinder can handle up to eight quarts of motor oil, depending on what type it is.In general, most professional oil change services include five quarts of oil. If you need more than that, you will need to pay extra. 3. Location of Service The cost changes greatly based on where you take your vehicle. You can do it at home, take it to a local dealership, visit an auto shop or drive into one of the fast lube locations.The least expensive route is to perform the oil change yourself. However, you need to have the expertise to perform the task at home. For this job, you just need a few tools and the necessary materials. If you perform your own oil changes, it?s also recommended that you do other maintenance tasks at the same time. Remember to change the oil filter and give the vehicle a quick inspection to ensure nothing else requires your attention.Professional oil changes will cost more, but you can save money based on where you visit. If you take your vehicle to the local lube station, you will spend less than at the dealership. However, these technicians don?t have the same experience working on your vehicle. In fact, it?s not uncommon for them to strip the oil pan plug or cause other damage. With that said, you don?t have to get your oil changed at the dealership unless you already have an agreement to do so. These are often the most comprehensive oil change services, including other tasks, such as topping off other fluids, an inspection of the brakes and a tire pressure check. You might find that these other services provide enough benefit to pay the extra cost. "
what is the Oil Change Intervals ?	"With every vehicle, it?s important that the oil gets changed at its appropriate interval. However, the recommendation can be different based on your vehicle?s year, make and model. You can find the recommendation in your owner?s manual or speak to your local dealership. In general, the intervals will be set at every 5,000, 7,500 or 10,000 miles.The driving conditions also affect the frequency of oil changes. If you are hard on the car engine, it might require more regular oil changes. In many cases, regular towing, driving in extreme temperatures (hot or cold) and idling often can cause more wear to the engine. The motor also receives more abuse when you drive in city traffic versus highway roads. By following the manufacturer?s recommendations, you ensure the engine remains running its best. Synthetic oil will last longer than conventional oil, further helping to protect the vital motor components. No matter what type of oil you use, it?s important to get regular oil changes to ensure maximum lubrication of the internal engine components. If the parts rub and create friction, severe engine damage can occur. This problem only leads to more costly repair bills down the road."
what are the Symptoms Of A Clogged or Bad Oil Filter ?	"The most common symptom of a bad or clogged oil filter is an oil pressure warning symbol on your dashboard. You may also notice more noise coming from the engine at idle or during acceleration. A stalling engine is also a sign, but if it happens, it could be too late already.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or clogged oil filter to look for:1. Oil Pressure Warning symbol on dashboardEngine Oil Pressure LightWithout oil pressure in your engine, it will not last many minutes. Therefore all car models have an oil pressure warning light which will show up on your dashboard if the oil pressure is too low and fatal for the engine.If you have noticed a red oil warning light on your dashboard it is definitely time to check it directly because if you keep driving the car it can result in very expensive repair costs of your engine and in most cases you have to replace the whole engine.If the warning light only appears sometimes it can also be a sign of low oil pressure caused by a bad or clogged oil filter.2. Low Oil PressureYour vehicle might also have an oil pressure gauge that shows you the levels your engine is operating on. If you see that the oil pressure is lower than usual it is definitely time for concern.If the oil pressure begins to drop while you are driving, this is cause for alarm. Continuing to drive with low oil pressure can lead to complete engine failure. You should pull over and check the oil levels immediately. If there is enough oil in the system, the dirty filter could be causing a restriction or there could be a malfunction with the oil pump. 3. Noisy EngineWhen oil can?t flow around the engine due to a clogged oil filter, the metal components begin to grind together due to an excessive amount of friction. This will result in a very noisy engine which can also result in metal-to-metal noises from the engine.Allowing continued metal-to-metal contact is going to create a lot of wear on the engine. Left unchecked, it will turn into engine damage, which is an expensive repair. 4. High Oil PressureA clogged oil filter can actually also cause high oil pressure if the oil pressure sensor is measuring the oil pressure before the oil filter.High oil pressure is far as bad as low oil pressure for the engine but it can still cause gaskets to leak oil for example. If you noticed that there are external oil leaks coming from the engine or the oil filter it may be caused by a bad oil filter.Most car models will also show the oil pressure warning light when the oil pressure is too high also, so if that light is showing on your dashboard it can also be showing because of too high oil pressure.5. Stalling engineBecause low oil pressure is so fatal for the engine, many modern car models have a safety switch that will shut off the car engine if the oil pressure is too low while running.If your engine stalled and you see the oil pressure warning light when you start the engine again, it can definitely be a good idea to check the oil filter."
where the Oil Filter Location ?	"The oil filter location varies based on the type of vehicle you drive. Sometimes, you can only get to the oil filter from underneath the car. In this case, you might need to remove the splash shield or skid plate to access it. Other vehicles allow you to reach the oil filter from above the vehicle. If you aren?t sure, it?s best to check your owner?s manual for a diagram. Additionally, oil filters come in several designs. Your vehicle might have a replaceable filter that fits in a plastic housing or it could be a screw-on canister made from metal. "
what is The Function of an Oil Filter ?	"The car?s oil filter is responsible for filtering out contaminants and keeping the oil flowing properly. The clean oil filter traps all of the harmful dirt, metal, debris and contaminants that are trying to infiltrate the engine oil. Without this filter, the particles will get into the engine and cause damage. With the right oil filter, the engine stays cleaner, ensuring it lasts longer.Additionally, the oil filter is responsible for keeping the oil where it belongs. Oil enters and moves through the filter via that tapping plate. This plate appears as a hole with smaller ones around it. The motor oil travels into the smaller holes through the filter media and comes back out the center hole. As the oil moves through the filter media, contaminants are trapped. When the motor isn?t running, the anti-drain back valve ensures oil doesn?t seep into the filter from the engine. There might also be a relief valve, which allows a small discharge of unfiltered oil into the engine when the weather is cold and it needs an added boost. All of these vital parts ensure the oil is flowing as needed unless the filter is clogged. "
what is the Clogged Oil Filter Replacement Cost ?	"Oil filters cost between $10 and $20, making them one of the least expensive parts of your vehicle. Because of the low cost, it only makes sense to ensure that regular oil filter replacement is part of your maintenance routine.Changing an oil filter is simple enough to do at home during your oil change. However, if you need to get a professional oil and filter change, you could look at spending $30 to $75 for a conventional oil and filter change, or around $60 to $125 for a synthetic oil and filter change. For the cost, you should always replace the oil filter at the first sign of trouble. Replace the filter with every oil change, even if you aren?t noticing any problems. This simple task could save your engine from catastrophic damage, so it should never be ignored."
Can a clogged oil filter cause rough idle?	"Yes, if the oil pressure is low, there is a possibility that the hydraulic valves or camshaft tensioners are not working properly, which can cause rough idle. However, a noisy engine is a more common sign of a clogged oil filter."
Can a clogged oil filter cause a car not to start?	"Yes, a clogged oil filter can cause problems with the camshaft timing or the hydraulic valves, which can cause starting problems. If you have driven too far with low oil pressure, there is also a risk that your engine will seize due to low oil pressure."
How often should I change the oil filter?	"The oil filter should be replaced every time you do an oil change on your engine. This is usually every 6,000 to 18,000 miles, depending on the car model. Check your car?s service manual for the correct service schedule."
Does a bad oil filter affect performance?	"Yes, a bad oil filter can cause problems with the camshaft timing or hydraulic valve, which can cause performance problems. But in this case, you will most likely see a check engine light on your dashboard also."

High Mileage Oil Buyer?s Guide	"Every engine has had a different life and has various oil requirements. Therefore, there is hardly any product perfect for all high mileage engines out there. However, choosing the right oil is imperative to ensure better engine performance and life. We have come up with a buyer?s guide to help you make the best purchasing decision. Below is a list of some things you must consider before investing in a high mileage motor oil. "
what is the Motor Oil Types ?	"The type of motor oil you use influences engine performance. All high mileage oils are made for older engines. However, the way each oil type lubricates and protects the engine is very different.  There are three types of motor oils:Conventional OilConventional oil or mineral oil is made of organic substances and is extracted from the ground. Therefore, there are little to no additives to the final product. They?re generally cheaper but have a low tolerance to high temperatures and can burn off quickly.Synthetic OilMan-made oils containing numerous chemicals and additives are called synthetic oils. They are very versatile and high-performance. Even though they are expensive, they are made to be compatible with most pressure and temperature conditions. Semi-Synthetic OilThese oils are a mix of conventional or mineral oil and synthetic oils. They generally have shared advantages. Therefore, they might have better heat tolerance and have very few chemical additions. They come in several viscosity ratings, adding variety and options into the market."
what is the Motor Age ?	"Each high mileage oil has a different capacity for the motor age it can support. You must check the miles credited to your vehicle and see the oil best suited for its requirements. While some high mileage motor oils are suitable for engines under 75,000 miles, some work best for engines older than that. The higher the mileage of the engine, the more worn out it is expected to be. Therefore, while choosing the oil, you should see if it can rejuvenate and maintain the cracks and leaks your engine might have faced during its lifetime. Weather ConditionsWhere you live affects your vehicle in many more ways than you can imagine. The external temperature and pressure conditions will change the way the engine is ignited. Therefore, the state the engine is in will be impacted by weather conditions. If you live in a low-temperature area, it is best to get motor oils that can sustain high-performance at low temperatures. With high-temperature, you should look for extremely high-temperature sustainability in the oil because the engine doesn?t only tackle internal but also external heat. Recommended Viscosity Viscosity plays a vital role while choosing motor oil, especially so while choosing high mileage motor oils. Density changes the way the fluid flows through the cylinders. Therefore, it influences heat generation in gear sets, cylinders, and bearings. Viscosity also affects the engine?s overall fuel efficiency. It also changes engine smoothness at various temperature ranges. Before buying motor oil, it is best to check the viscosity recommendation of your engine. Each engine manufacturer knows the requirements of their product better than anyone else. Sticking to the mentioned recommendation will help you yield the best results out of your investment. Level of ProtectionWhile dealing with high mileage engines, it is crucial to check the protection level provided by the oil you?re going to use. While some oils only provide excellent lubrication, others have the capability of protecting against wear. However, when using oil for high mileage engines, you require much more than just lubrication. With good quality engine oils, you get sludge production prevention, leakage prevention, and corrosion resistance. Some oils can also heal cracks and damages inside the engine. It is best to invest in such motor oils since they are excellent for improving the engine?s longevity.Lubrication As the oil?s lubrication capacity increases, so do the engine?s performance. Good high mileage motor oils have the capacity to lubricate the oil so well that they repair pre-dried engines and heals cracks. It is the best way to increase an engine?s lifespan. With adequate lubrication, you can prevent gaps from occurring within the components. It also enhances the functional smoothness within the engine. AdditivesAdditives are a way of enhancing the performance and quality of synthetic oils. Additives are also an excellent source of providing all the extra features you require your high mileage motor oil to serve. Some commonly used additives are as follows:Detergents: They help in removing the deposits accumulated over the engine to prevent clogging and improving efficiency. Viscosity-index improvers: If your vehicle doesn?t require too thin an oil, these additives prevent the oil from getting too thin as the temperature rises. Dispersants: Dispersants don?t allow particles to stick together. Therefore, the better and more powerful the dispersants, the fewer chances of sludge formation are there in the oil.Summing UpAs your engine gets older, it will require extra care. There is nothing better than switching to high mileage oils that can protect your engine. These oils repair the engine and help increase the engine?s lifespan while improving performance. The best way to choose the right engine oil is to do some homework and check out some products. You must check your engine?s requirements and select the oil that can address the issues you have been facing with your engine. You can use this article as a reference point to buy the best motor oil for high mileage engine."
What Are The Differences Between 0w20 vs. 5w20 and 5w30?	"The difference between the 0w20 vs. 5w20 vs. 5w30 oil is the viscosity. Each oil viscosity has its own advantages and disadvantages in different temperatures, and not all of them work together with all engines.Here?s some more detailed information on the differences between these engine oils"
What is Oil Viscosity?	"Oil viscosity is measured by the liquid?s resistance to flow when used at a certain temperature. Thinner oils are going to pour easier at lower temperatures, while the thicker oils maintain a higher viscosity.Winter-grade oil is typically thinner because it reduces friction inside the engine, allowing the vehicle to start easier at colder temperatures. Summer-grade oil is typically thicker, offering superior film strength and better sealing at high temperatures. In 1911, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) created a numerical code system to classify the oils by viscosity. Today?s format is written XW-XX. The first X shows the cold temperature viscosity, with the W standing for winter. The second XX stands for the high-temperature viscosity. "
What is 0W-20 Oil?	"0W20 oil is considered low viscosity and is often chosen for its cold-weather performance. The 0 indicates that it will flow better when the temperatures dip than the comparable 5W oils. In this rating, the 0 shows the winter viscosity, while the 20 represents the high-temperature rating. This multi-viscosity oil contains additives to give it better performance in the winter. 0W-20 Engine Oil BenefitsMany modern vehicles come with 0W-20 synthetic oil to improve engine performance while boosting environmental conditions. Even during cold weather, there are fewer losses in the oil because of the lower viscosity. However, 0W-20 oil can cost more than the other options. With that in mind, spending a little more on your engine maintenance can benefit the motor?s lifespan. This small investment can prevent expensive engine repairs down the road. "
What is 5W20 Oil?	"With 5W20 oil, the lubricants are meant to flow decently at lower temperatures, yet still provide protection when it is warmer out. This oil doesn?t just provide good cold-starting performance, but also provides protection in the summer.The five stands for the lower viscosity at low temperatures. The 20 is the oil?s viscosity rating during warmer temperatures. 5W20 Oil Benefits5W20 motor oil offers better fuel economy than the comparable 5W30 variant. That?s because it creates less friction with the thinner viscosity formula. This oil drags less among the engine components, which also means a reduction in protection.With the thin composition, the oil moves seamlessly from the pump to the engine. This design means that it won?t operate as well in warmer temperatures when compared with 5W30 oil."
What is 5W30 Oil?	"5W30 motor oil is designed for both colder and warmer temperatures. It provides a decent start-up in cold temperatures, but also offers great protection during hotter times.The five stands for the winter rating, while 30 shows how it operates during the summer. Overall, it?s considered the best for any season because of its versatility. 5W30 Oil BenefitsThis multi-degree oil doesn?t just help start the engine when it?s cold, but can also handle the warm summer temperatures too. However, the thicker composition makes it less fuel-efficient than the 5W20 comparison.With that in mind, the thicker viscosity does provide better protection for the internal engine components. Customers who are looking for maximum protection will benefit from this multi-purpose rating."
how to Picking the Right Motor Oil for Your Vehicle ?	"1. Manufacturer Recommendation The automaker knows your vehicle the best, so its guidance should be followed when picking motor oil. You can find the recommendation listed in the owner?s manual or call your local dealership.If there are two variants listed as options, such as 0W20 and 5W20, you will want to choose the best for your environment. These oils can be used interchangeably without consequence. 2. Viscosity RatingThe lower the number rating is, the better the oil is going to flow. For example, the 0W20 oil flows better than 5W20 during startup. However, these oils are going to perform the same at regular operating temperatures because they are both rated at 20. Engine oil will naturally thicken as it cools down and thins once heated. 3. Industry TestingWhen choosing a motor oil, pay close attention to the quality testing that?s performed. You want to see both the API donut and the starburst symbol on the package.The API donut shows that it has passed testing from the American Petroleum Institute. Additionally, the starburst is used to show qualification for SL service. 4. LocationWhen choosing the right oil viscosity from the recommended options, you must consider the location you are using it in. For example, OW20 is going to work better in cold climates, such as Maine or Alaska, while 5W20 can be used in slightly warmer climates.Knowing the temperature spectrum helps you choose the right oil. The 0W-20 oil range is between -40øF to 68øF. In comparison, the 5W20 oil range is -31øF to 68øF, while 5W30 is rated for -31øF to 104øF.5. Fuel EconomyThe thinner the oil viscosity, the better the fuel economy will be because the lubricant flows easier. With this in mind, 0W20 is going to be more fuel-efficient at startup than 5W20, but they will operate the same once the engine is warmed. 0W20 also provides better fuel economy than 5W30 in both colder and warmer environments. However, 5W20 only outperforms 5W30 at warmer temperatures. With the right oil in the engine, you can provide the protection it needs to keep running longer. Do your research before choosing an oil to ensure you get the right level of performance."
What Does SAE Mean in Oil?	"SAE in motor oil stands for ?Society of Automotive Engineers.? This is the group that designed the viscosity coding system for motor oils. This means the ?SAE? refers to the oil viscosity specification.In fact, the SAE was founded by Henry Ford and Andrew Ricker back in 1905. Originally, it was meant to be the organization for automotive engineers working around the country, but it didn?t take long for the role to expand. By 1916, SAE had added tractor and aeronautical engineers to the group and quickly formed into the group it is known as today. By the end of World War I, SAE had taken on an educational role, ensuring industry standards. In fact, SAE standards go beyond oil viscosities. The group oversees the automotive industry, but also has a part in aerospace, petroleum, trucking and more.Its main role is to ensure consistency across the market. For example, the 5W40 motor oil that you enjoy in Ohio will be the same that you would buy in India. Without this standard, motor oil would vary wherever you were, causing the cost to also rise.The SAE is responsible for maintaining over 1,600 practices and standards. While the SAE cannot enforce the law, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has placed the SAE in the documentation that states the federal safety agency?s standards and rules. This is also true in Canada, where Transport Canada is responsible for setting guidelines. "
What is Oil Viscosity? 	"Oil viscosity measures how long it takes the oil to flow through a particular container at specific temperatures. When the oil contains a higher viscosity, it takes longer to flow versus oil with a lower viscosity. Typically, motor oil is rated with a number, XW-XX. For example, you will notice that motor oil is listed as SAE 5W-30, SAE 10W-30 or SAE 10W-40. Since I?ve already looked at the meaning of SAE, it?s time to examine the other aspects of the formula.The letter ?W? stands for ?Winter.? Many people assume that it means ?Weight,? but that?s not the case. The number located right before the W shows how the oil flows when at 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The lower this number is, the less likely the oil is to thicken when the temperatures get cold. In areas that are consistently cool, a 0W or 5W motor oil tends to perform the best. After the ?W,? there are two other numbers. These indicate the oil viscosity rating when operating at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Basically, this number shows how fast the oil thins out when operating at higher temperatures. In this example, the 10W-30 motor oil and 10W-40 oil are going to function the same in colder weather, but the first is going to thin out faster when the temperatures rise. "
what is the types of  Motor Oil ?	"Conventional Motor OilBack in the day, conventional motor oil was all that was available. It is the purest form of oil, containing no additives. It?s also the cheapest and easiest to find. While the oil follows SAE standards, it will require changing more frequently, and doesn?t provide high-performance protection. Premium Conventional Motor OilThere?s very little difference between standard conventional and premium conventional oils. In fact, you will find the same 5W-30, 10-30 and other designations available. Additionally, these oils don?t contain any additives.Typically, these oils are pushed by car manufacturers as being better than conventional, but that isn?t typically the case. However, they can be used for most light-duty vehicles and often cost less than synthetic oils.High-Mileage Motor OilIf your vehicle contains more than 75,000 miles, you want to take extra steps to protect the engine. That?s where high-mileage motor oil comes into play.In some formulas, seal conditioners have been added. This formulation ensures more protection for the engine that is starting to wear out. You will find that these high-mileage oils often cost more, but if it keeps the engine running longer, it?s well worth the expense. Synthetic Motor OilFull-synthetic oil is designed to provide better performance and protection. Special additives are included for a variety of purposes, from cleaning out corrosion to lubricating the seals better. Each formula is made differently but must still adhere to SAE standards.Synthetic oil will cost the most of all other options. However, you can push the vehicle longer without an oil change because of the special formulation. Synthetic Blend Motor OilFor most modern vehicles on the road, this type of oil is the preferred option. Basically, synthetic blends provide some of the benefits of full synthetics, but are also mixed with some conventional oil to keep the cost down.Each formulation contains its own additives, so research will be required to find the appropriate option for your vehicle. However, you should be able to go longer between oil changes than you did with conventional oil.To determine what viscosity and type of motor oil are best for your vehicle, reference your car owner?s manual or speak with the dealership."

Valvoline Pros	"Valvoline Instant Oil Change locations first arrived in 1985. Today the company is headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky. Obviously, the company uses high-quality Valvoline motor oils, which are among the best-selling in the country. You can also look forward to these pros for Valvoline shops.Available 18-point inspection15-minute drive thru oil changesCertified techniciansHigh customer ratingsNo appointment needed"
what is The Quick Oil Change Industry ?	"In the United States, the oil change industry market size is $11 billion. At this time, there are about 34,000 businesses in the country, employing about 72,000 people. Interestingly, Shell (Jiffy Lube) and Valvoline are the two largest oil change service companies in the nation. The future of the industry shows a rise in profits. Increased travel times and more vehicle miles mean more frequent maintenance appointments. By next year, we should see a dramatic increase in services and revenue, with the largest growth happening from now through 2028."
Is Jiffy Lube the same as Valvoline?	"No, Jiffy Lube is a subsidiary of Shell, which is a rival oil company to Valvoline. Both of the companies provide quick oil changes without an appointment. There are a lot of similarities between the two, but Valvoline seems to be more professional and reliable. "
Who is best for an oil change?	"If you can perform your an oil change on your own, it?s best to do it yourself. With your own work, you know the job was done right. If you would rather take your vehicle to a quick lube, it?s best to trust Valvoline because of the experienced technicians and better customer rating. "
Does Valvoline actually change oil?	"Yes, the Valvoline quick lube locations change oil and provide other preventative maintenance services. You can also go to one of the locations for more complicated procedures, such as a radiator flush or differential fluid replacement. Valvoline has great customer reviews, proving it?s a great choice."
What brand of oil does Jiffy Lube use?	"While Jiffy Lube is owned by Shell, not all locations use oil from Shell. Instead, some websites suggest that Pennzoil is the brand of oil most commonly used, which is one of the most popular. You can choose conventional or synthetic motor oil, depending on your needs. "
How long does Valvoline synthetic oil change last?	"Most cars will require a synthetic oil change every 7,500 to 10,000 miles, depending on manufacturer recommendations. Conventional motor oil is designed to be changed every 3,000 miles, while the synthetic blend falls somewhere in the middle of the two. "
Conclusion	"When you want to let someone else handle your oil change, either Jiffy Lube or Valvoline might be the right place to choose. However, as professional mechanics, we would have to be slightly leery about taking our cars to Jiffy Lube. The technicians aren?t as experienced as those of Valvoline and the customer reviews have been an issue. Of course, we have to recommend trying to do your own oil change. With a few simple tools and some basic knowledge, you can do your own oil change at home. With your hands on the system, you know everything has been done right and you can put your eyes on the other components to catch any potential problems before bigger issues occur. Either way, the important thing is that the oil changes get done on time, no matter who does them."
Which Is Better Valvoline Or Mobil 1 ?	"According to statistics, Valvoline sells far more motor oil than Mobil 1, but that doesn?t mean it?s a better brand. Both offer a variety of motor oils for any automotive need and they have reasonable prices. It?s fair to say that Valvoline is more OEM focused, while Mobil 1 caters to racing applications.Still, it?s important to evaluate both brands, looking at what the formulas contain and what each does better. Because they aren?t the same, it?s difficult to determine which one fits every need. That?s a decision only you can make. ValvolineValvoline Engine OilDr. John Ellis created the Valvoline Company in 1866. It was founded on the discovery of crude oil?s lubrication capacity. As soon as the Model T became a mass-produced vehicle, Valvoline became the only brand recommended by Ford, making it an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) product. During the 1940s and 50s, Valvoline released its first single-grade oil, followed by an all-climate oil, which is probably a multi-grade option. Today, the company remains one of the most known for high-mileage, synthetic and high-performance oils, only following after Pennzoil. Valvoline ProsWhy do so many consumers like Valvoline? There are many things the company does right. Here are a few pros to consider.High-quality and consistent standardProtects against oil leaksGuarantees 40% additional wear protection versus other oilsWide selection of formulas to choose fromMaintains integrity even under extreme temperatures and conditionsValvoline ConsIt?s difficult to find negative things to say about Valvoline, but a search online reveals a few customer complaints. Specialty oils can be expensive, such as diesel or motorcycle formulasDoesn?t offer the longest mileage intervalsProducts can leak during shipmentMobil 1Mobil 1 OilMobil 1 hasn?t been around as long as Valvoline has, but the company has made a name for itself. Originally introduced during the 1960s, synthetic oils were produced for diesel motors in the harsh climate of Alaska. Since then, the company has continued making oils that would stand up to extremes.Today, Mobil 1 may be most known for its participation in motorsports. The company sponsors F1 and Grand Prix teams, proving that the oil can be used in a variety of applications.Mobil 1 ProsThe list of Mobil 1 pros is just about the same length as that of Valvoline, but the benefits are different. Here are a few to considerWorks well in freezing temperaturesProtects against sludgeConsistent flow in any climateLasts longerPerforms well in older enginesBoosts fuel economy and engine performanceMobil 1 ConsAgain, the list of complaints against Mobil 1 is minimal. If we had to pick some disadvantages, they would be these two. ExpensiveNot recommended for some foreign brands"
What?s the Difference Between Valvoline and Mobil 1 Oil?	"Both Valvoline and Mobil 1 are top brands of motor oil, so what makes them different from one another? We look at the cost, viscosity grades, performance, longevity and engine compatibility. 1. CostBoth the Mobil 1 and Valvoline brand are considered some of the best. For this reason, you can expect to spend a premium price for either option. Most often, Valvoline can be purchased for a slightly lower price than Mobil 1. Yet, with both, you are going to pay substantially more for specialty oils, such as those for motorcycles or diesel motors. 2. Viscosity GradesOil ViscosityViscosity grades are determined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). It?s a rating of engine oils that shows how well it flows. The first number of the rating ends with a W, indicating its winter rating. The second number shows how the oil flows when it?s at the normal engine temperature.Both Valvoline and Mobil 1 have a variety of engine oil viscosity grades to fit any need. You can get an appropriate grade for cold winter weather and warm, hot summers. 3. PerformanceBoth Mobil 1 and Valvoline perform well, but for different reasons. For example, Mobil 1 reduces oxidation in the engine and leaves the motor with fewer deposits. It also removes deposits that might have built up before using it. Additionally, Mobil 1 reduces friction and enhances combustibility, which is helpful with cold start-ups.So, what does Valvoline do well? The synthetic and Maxlife formulations have added antioxidants designed to control friction levels. These antioxidants also keep the lubricating properties from breaking down prematurely. We especially like the Valvoline High Mileage oil with Maxlife to increase the lifespan of the motor. 4. LongevityConventional motor oils are typically only rated for 3,500 to 5,000 miles. However, synthetic oils have special additives that increase the life. These additives can boost performance, allowing you to go longer between oil changes.While each formulation is different, Valvoline has some that allow 12,000 miles between oil changes. If that?s not long enough, Mobil 1 offers some 18,000-mile formulations. You must remember to have a longer life oil filter at the same time, or you will be changing the oil anyway. 5. Engine CompatibilityFor the most part, both Valvoline and Mobil 1 have oils for a variety of engine types. While the majority are for standard gasoline engines, there are special formulations for diesels, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and more. Valvoline has been an OEM brand trusted by many auto manufacturers. On the other hand, there are some brands that advise against Mobil 1. "
How to Choose Motor Oil  ?	"Once you?ve determined what brand you want, it?s time to consider what oil is going to be best. Most brands have several types of oil to choose from, so consider these factors.Types: Conventional oil is the traditional type made from crude oil. There?s also synthetic that?s made from special ingredients designed in a lab. Synthetic oil lasts the longest but is also the most expensive. There?s also a synthetic blend option that pairs the best of both worlds.Age of Vehicle: Once your car hits 75,000 miles, it may be wise to go with high-mileage oil. These oils provide more protection for the aging motor.Driving Style: If you don?t push your car to extremes, you can go with a standard oil. On the other hand, if you tow often or push your vehicle hard, choose something on the higher end. Viscosity: It?s always best to choose the motor oil viscosity that matches what?s outlined in your owner?s manual. If you choose to use something contrary to what?s recommended, you could void the car warranty. Always check your owner?s manual to choose an approved oil with the right specifications for your vehicle."
Does it really matter what brand of oil you choose?	"When it comes to groceries, you can easily choose the generic formula without noticing any difference, but that?s not true with motor oil. Off-brand engine oil can have harmful fillers that can damage your motor in the long run. Spend a little more for better motor oil. "
Is Valvoline a high-quality oil?	"Valvoline is the second most popular motor oil, followed only behind Pennzoil. It?s become a popular brand because of the high-quality additives and formulation that?s used. It can provide protection for the engine, ensuring a longer motor life. "
Is Valvoline full synthetic oil any good?	"The fully synthetic formula by Valvoline is trusted by experts because of how well it protects the engine. With the unique additives, it?s meant to lubricate and protect for many miles. It will last longer than standard conventional oil, so you won?t need to change the oil as frequently. "
Is Mobil 1 the best motor oil?	"Some people swear by Mobil 1 motor oil, especially in the motorsports arena. However, it?s not the only brand worth considering. Valvoline is also a top brand and it sells far more each year than Mobil 1. For that reason, it?s important to look at the benefits of both oils before deciding. "
Who makes the highest quality oil?	"There are several brands that make a high-quality oil. Among some of the top sellers, you have Pennzoil, Valvoline and Mobil 1 to consider. To determine which one is better for you, it?s important to look at the different formulations and pick the one that hits the points that matter the most to you. "
Conclusion	"As we work on different vehicles, we see a lot of different brands of motor oil used. Every driver seems to have a preference, so it?s difficult to tell which one suits your needs the best. You can talk to friends and family, but you?ll probably get a lot of different answers. For that reason, it?s best to do your own research.Start looking at the properties included with each oil type. You can also read online reviews to see what others think. The only way to know for sure what?s best is to start trying them out. Perform some of your own analysis to determine which ones perform the way you desire. Soon enough, you?ll also have a favorite oil brand."
Which Is Better Castrol Edge Or Mobil 1 ?	"Among the market share of motor oils, both Mobil 1 and Castrol Edge are top choices. Mobil 1 is slightly more popular than Castrol, but not by much. Both companies create oil with a variety of viscosities and additives, ensuring superior engine performance.Castrol Edge contains special detergents that clean out unwanted sludge from the engine. In comparison, Mobil 1 is used mainly for higher horsepower applications and contains oxidation stability to prevent corrosion. As professional mechanics, we can?t see a big enough difference with either one that causes us to pick a winner. The answer depends on your vehicle and other factors, so you would need to perform an evaluation for yourself to see what you prefer. Castrol EdgeCastrol EdgeCastrol Edge is a synthetic motor oil from the British oil company Castrol. This company was founded in 1899 and has been owned by BP since 2000. Today, the company has multiple headquarters in the United Kingdom, New Jersey and Illinois. It?s known for producing high-quality lubricants for use in most gas- or diesel-powered engines, including cars, motorcycles, as well as two- or four-stroke engines. Castrol Edge ProsAfter all of the years of production, Castrol knows a thing or two about creating decent oil. Here are a few of the top pros.Better wear protectionHas titanium particles to reduce frictionLong-lasting formulaAffordableWorks with most major car brandsCastrol Edge ConsEven though there are a lot of reasons to choose Castrol, there are some downsides to evaluate too. Can be difficult to findIsn?t as popularCompany has been accused of lying (see below)Mobil 1Mobil 1 OilMobil 1 is a brand of synthetic motor oils that is sold by ExxonMobil. The American-based company first introduced the oils in 1974. The company spends a lot of money sponsoring motorsports activities, which makes sense since the oils are focused on high-horsepower performance. Today, Mobil 1 is a leader in oils, filters and other automotive parts. Mobil 1 ProsThe list of Mobil 1 advantages can be quite long, but here are a few worth considering.Great engine protectionProven synthetic formulaPrevents oxidationWorks in all temperaturesMobil 1 ConsAdditionally, here are some cons to consider before purchasing Mobil 1 oil. Costs moreDoesn?t work with all foreign brands"
What?s the Difference Between Castrol Edge and Mobil 1 Oil?	"There are probably more similarities between the two oil companies than differences. However, here are a few factors to consider as you make your choice. 1. CostNeither of these companies is considered the budget option. Because they are both geared toward long life and engine performance, you can expect to pay a premium price for either.Still, Castrol Edge comes in slightly cheaper than Mobil 1. The only trouble is that Castrol Edge isn?t sold at as many retailers, making it a little more difficult to find. 2. Viscosity GradesCastrol Engine OilYou can find a nice selection of viscosity grades for either motor oil brand. Whether you need 0W-20 or 10W-30, you know that both brands are ready to accommodate you.To find the best viscosity for your vehicle, you must look in the vehicle owner?s manual. It?s important to follow all of the recommendations by your car manufacturer. 3. PerformanceIf you want a high-performance motor oil, we don?t think you can go wrong with either brand. These aren?t designed to be generic or low-quality in any way. However, Mobil 1 may have a slight advantage over Castrol Edge in this category. There?s a larger range of products and a better composition overall, perfect for a sports car or premium vehicles. 4. LongevityBoth of these companies produce synthetic motor oils, so you can expect a long service life with either. Synthetic oils are rated for 7,500 to 15,000 miles, on average. However, Mobil 1 does offer some that claim to go up to 20,000 miles, while Castrol states its formulas perform the same.While this might be suggested, you may not want to go that long without changing your oil. Plus, it?s important to install a new oil filter occasionally to keep the dirt and contaminants out of the engine. 5. Engine CompatibilityCan these two motor oils be used with any type of engine? For the most part, the answer is yes. However, it?s important to check the manufacturer?s recommendations for your vehicle. Some foreign brands don?t recommend the use of Mobil 1 oils. These automakers would prefer you use OEM oils instead, but they cost a lot more money. 6. IntegrityYou want to be able to trust a company you buy from. While we don?t know whether either company is deceitful or untrustworthy, it?s important to take a look at a case that happened between the two.In 1998, Mobil filed a complaint against Castrol with the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau. The claim stated that Castrol was engaged in false advertising, calling its Syntec a fully synthetic oil. However, Castrol did provide enough evidence proving that the oil was worthy of being called synthetic, so the BBB ruled with Castrol. There are a lot of claims on the internet that Mobil filed a lawsuit against the company or that Castrol was found to be guilty in some way. These statements are not true. However, the issue has damaged the integrity of the Castrol brand, even if it did nothing wrong. "
Is Castrol Edge really full synthetic?	"Castrol Edge motor oils are fully synthetic and designed to last up to 20,000 miles between changes. This popular brand uses Fluid Titanium Technology that reduces friction and strengthens the oil from wear. It?s one of the leading brands to choose from, falling just behind Mobil 1 in market share. "
Is Castrol Edge good for high-mileage cars?	"Yes, because of the titanium technology and special additives, Castrol Edge has been a top option for owners with high-mileage vehicles. You may choose to change the oil more frequently if you drive a car with higher mileage just to ensure that the engine continues running its best. "
"Does Castrol Edge really last 20,000 miles?"	"Castrol claims that the synthetic oil will go up to 20,000 miles between changes. Most people won?t want to follow this recommendation, especially if they are hard on their vehicles. Any towing or driving in extreme climates requires more frequent oil changes."
How many miles is Mobil 1 full synthetic good for?	"The manufacturer claims that the synthetic oil can go for up to 18,000 miles or more. Extended Performance oils are rated for up to 20,000 miles. However, it?s best to change the oil more frequently, especially if you tow or drive in extreme climates. "
Conclusion	"Choosing between Castrol Edge vs. Mobil 1 can be difficult if you aren?t sure what you are looking at. Because we?ve worked with both motor oils, we know it can be difficult to choose. Honestly, it?s quite hard to tell the difference between the two. It?s our recommendation that you give each a try during an oil change. Make a note if you see any difference with either one, so you can make up your own mind on which one to use. This is the only way you would know how each oil would perform with your vehicle.It is always best to choose the motor oil with the correct specifications recommended by your car manufacturer, as they have tested the oil with your particular car engine for the best results."
Who Makes Supertech Oil?	"Supertech oil is made by Warren Oil Company, Inc., one of America?s largest independent lubricant manufacturers.

Check the specifications for your car model to ensure that the engine oil has the requirements you need.If you have an older car that you want cheap and reliable engine oil, Supertech is a great choice."
differences between Supertech and Competitors ?	"One of the most popular motor oils available on the market is Mobil 1, which is highly regarded by many auto specialists due to its quality and durability. Moreover, Mobil 1 is the official motor oil for Nascar and has been promoted and authorized by many automotive specialists and racing experts. Due to its popularity and association with NASCAR, Mobil 1 is a lot more expensive than Supertech Oil, but are there any differences in terms of quality?We cannot truly say whether both oils are identical, but it is a fact that they share many similar characteristics. For instance, both Supertech and Mobil 1 are synthetic oils. Both of them are licensed by Dexos 1, both fully comply with the government?s safety standards and regulations, and both are considered perfect for gasoline engines.The major difference between the brands is that Mobil 1 costs almost double compared to Supertech, so people usually consider the former superior."
Does Brand Matter When Buying Motor Oil?	"Many people have a misconception that more famous brands have better quality motor oil, and they usually pay a lot just for the brand name. This may not be true, and a recent analysis performed by Blackstone Laboratories indicates that all motor oils are interchangeable.This means that as long as you choose the oil which meets the weight and technical requirements of your vehicle, it does not matter very much which brand you choose.More expensive oil may cause your engine to hold up slightly longer though and not cause as much engine sludge.Supertech Oil PriceSupertech Motor Oil can be easily bought from Walmart at an average cost of $20 (pricing for the Supertech full synthetic SAW 5W-30 motor oil). The pricing varies according to the grade and the amount you are buying. You can also compare the pricing with eBay."
Is Supertech oil reliable?	"Based on all current reviews and customer feedback, Supertech motor oil is equally reliable as any other reputable brand. Its quality is backed by the fact they meet all the government?s specifications and requirements. Several blends are available, from conventional, mineral-based oils for older cars to full-synthetic ones needed for modern engines. And as most of them meet GM Dexos 1 specifications, you can use them in your new Chevy or Buick without voiding its warranty. So, despite being cheaper, Supertech motor oil is as good as its competitors"
Who makes Supertech oil?	"Initially, Supertech motor oil was made by one of the biggest independent lubricant manufacturers in the US ? the Warren Oil Company. In fact, they designed this series of oil blends for Walmart, which wanted to sell them in their stores and webshop. However, other manufacturers, such as ExxonMobil or Pennzoil, have also started making this popular oil brand. But regardless of who made it, the oil in the Supertech bottle is always the same."
How long does Supertech oil last?	"According to the manufacturer, Supertech motor oils are good for up to 10,000 miles. This is the interval in which they will offer superior lubrication and wear protection, prolonging your vehicle?s life. Still, this is only true for ideal driving conditions. So, if your daily commutes involve short trips and stop-go traffic, you should consider shortening this interval. Changing the engine oil every 7,500 in such cases may be the best bet for vehicles? longevity."
Is It OK to Mix Different Brands of Motor Oil?	"Yes. Mixing motor oils of different brands is OK as long as they have the same weight and meet identical specifications. Weight, or viscosity, is represented with an alphanumerical combination, such as 5W-30 or similar. The specification is a set of additional requirements made by the car manufacturer. For instance, most GM cars need motor oil that meets Dexos 1 or Dexos 2 specifications. Still, topping up the engine with the same oil brand is always the most recommendable option."
Conclusion	"The oil in a modern engine has several significant functions. Besides lubricating all moving components, it prevents sludge and carbon buildups while helping dissipate heat. With all that in mind, using top-quality oil is a must if you want your car to last, and Supertech motor oil is a good choice despite being priced considerably lower than its competitors.These lubricants are made by Warren Oil Company for Walmart, which then sells them in its stores. While initially there were some doubts, Supertech motor oils proved to be as good as its more expensive competitors."
What are the Causes Of Keyless Start System Problems on Honda Pilot ?	"If the keyless start system is giving you trouble on a Honda Pilot, it could be due to a bad engine start/stop switch, which is a known issue. It could also be due to low key fob battery voltage, low car battery voltage or a bad key fob. Let?s look at the options in-depth. 1. Bad Engine Start/Stop SwitchEngine Start Stop ButtonThe most common complaint stems from a bad engine start/stop switch. This feature turns off the engine automatically when you stop and restarts it when it?s time to get moving. It?s a fuel-saving feature, but in the Honda Pilot, it?s clear that the technology hasn?t been perfected. With some Honda vehicles, the keyless start system can?t find the key fob. This is something that occurs when the engine start/stop system is turned off due to a bad start/stop switch. To fix it, the system must be turned back on, but it?s not that simple because the switch is defective. 2. Low Key Fob Battery VoltageKey Fob BatteryIf the Honda complaint is causing the issue, the next possible cause is a lack of voltage to the key fob. If the battery dies in the key fob, the system isn?t going to work. As the battery starts to die, the signal begins to weaken too.Some people choose to replace the key fob battery at regular intervals to avoid it dying. This may not be the only solution, but it does help to watch for signs of it dying, so you can replace the battery before it causes trouble. 3. Low Car Battery VoltageLocate BatteryThere?s another battery you must think about. The car battery can start to die and the keyless start system won?t work. Car batteries only last around five years, so it?s important to watch for signs that it?s dying to replace it before bigger issues start. The headlights will start to dim and electronics may fail to work normally. Additionally, a blown fuse can also be to blame as its part of the electrical system. The system won?t be able receive the necessary voltage to run. 4. Bad Key FobOpen Car Key FobThe key fob is the part needed to start this Honda Pilot system. It?s a substitute for the generic key because it can open doors and start the engine. If you are getting a Keyless Start System Problem message in the Honda Pilot, consider an issue with the key fob.You?ve already looked at the battery, so that?s not the issue. However, it could have endured physical damage, especially if you have dropped it or it?s been submerged in water. "

Why my Check Engine Light Is Flashing And Car Is Shaking ?	"When the Check Engine Light starts flashing, you know something serious is occurring. It?s even more concerning when the car is shaking. Most likely, there?s a misfire occurring, either from a bad ignition coil, a bad spark plug, a faulty fuel injector, a bad engine sensor, or low compression.Let?s take a closer look at these causes.1. Engine Is Misfiring On One CylinderEngine CombustionWith an engine misfire, the combustion reaction doesn?t complete normally. In this situation, one cylinder will go unfired. A misfire can occur at engine startup while the vehicle is idling or in the middle of acceleration. It?s going to create a shaking feeling, and the Check Engine Light is sure to come on.With that said, a misfire isn?t the exact problem that needs to be fixed. There?s something causing the misfire, which is what we will talk about in the next examples. Any one of the remaining issues can lead to a misfiring engine. 2. Bad Ignition CoilThree Ignition Coils VagIgnition coils or coil packs commonly cause misfires and shaking. The ignition coils act as small transformers designed to generate high voltage current to power the spark plugs. When the ignition coils go bad, the engine doesn?t just misfire, but it also starts to idle rough and you?ll notice a decrease in power. Additionally, because the engine is working so hard, fuel economy suffers and you may have trouble starting the engine. 3. Bad Spark PlugsSymptoms Of Bad Spark PlugsSpark plugs are also a common culprit, especially if they haven?t been changed in a long time. When a spark plug stops operating, the cylinder it?s connected to can misfire. You get a rough and shaky motor plus a Check Engine Light. Over time, spark plugs naturally become contaminated. They get dirty and worn, leading to trouble creating the necessary spark to ignite the fuel-air mixture. For this reason, it?s best to replace the spark plugs at the recommended service intervals to avoid trouble. 4. Faulty Fuel InjectorBad Fuel InjectorFuel is needed in the combustion chamber to ensure smooth operation. If there?s not enough fuel, the engine struggles to run and it could misfire. Bad fuel injectors create this type of problem.Direct injection systems ensure that fuel is delivered into each cylinder. There has to be an accurate amount of fuel being injected, which is controlled by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The fuel injectors must also work in a consistent spray pattern for efficient combustion. Fuel injectors fail when they start leaking or they become blocked. The tip can get dirty, leading to a blockage. Additionally, hydrocarbon starts to build up on the tips because of fuel that?s left behind. If that?s not the problem, then it could also be a seal that?s worn out, allowing fuel to leak into the system.5. A Bad Engine SensorTypes Of Car SensorsToday?s car engines are equipped with a variety of sensors that keep everything running smoothly. These sensors are responsible for monitoring engine operations and they make adjustments. Some sensors measure airflow, while others keep track of fuel pressure and engine timing. If any one of the sensors fails, the operation of the engine suffers. Depending on how severe it is, the engine could misfire and the Check Engine Light may start to flash. 6. Low CompressionLow engine compression means that the cylinders can?t compress the right amount of air. Without the right air density to mix with fuel, the performance and efficiency of the engine suffer.You will notice misfires plus decreased fuel economy. It could be difficult to start the engine too. Different problems cause low compression, such as holes in a piston, a head gasket failure or leaky valves. Low compression can be one of the most difficult problems to diagnose and repair. "

What Does A Slip Light Mean?	"The car?s slip light shows a problem with the traction control system. It illuminates when you are driving down a slippery road and lose traction or tells you that something has malfunctioned. You may see the light flicker on and off in normal operations or stay on when there?s a failure.Every car wheel is outfitted with special sensors that relay the tire speed to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). If one wheel begins losing traction, the sensors will tell the system so the technology can kick in and attempt to regain control. However, the sensors can also malfunction, leading to abnormal readings. Very often, when the slip light comes on because of a malfunction, the ABS light also comes on. These two seem to work together so much that when a part fails, it affects both systems. "
What Could Cause A Slip Light?	"If the slip light comes on, it doesn?t automatically mean that something is wrong. It could mean that the system is working as intended. However, if the slip light comes on and stays on, there?s probably a mechanical failure of the speed sensors, ABS rings, ABS control unit, steering angle sensor, or wiring.Let?s look at these possibilities in-depth. 1. Faulty ABS Wheel Speed SensorsSigns Of A Bad Abs Wheel Speed SensorThose sensors we talked about earlier are known as speed sensors. They are attached to the wheels, where they monitor the speed of each. If the sensor becomes damaged, the ABS control unit receives alerts to enable when it shouldn?t.Once the PCM recognizes the problem, the slip light comes on. At the same time, the traction control system and ABS may stop working. 2. Driving On A Slippery SurfaceSlippery RoadThe slip light is one that can come on to indicate normal operating conditions. This is something that makes it different from most of the dashboard warning lights. When you hit a slippery patch of road and the wheels start to spin, the slip light will blink on the dash.In normal conditions, the slip light will immediately turn off as soon as traction is regained. If it doesn?t go away, one of the other mechanical failures is to blame. 3. Defective ABS RingsSymptoms Of A Bad Abs Reluctor RingThe ABS rings are gear-like. They serve as the relay to the ABS speed sensor, which is responsible for recording the speeds of the wheels.If the slip light comes on, a broken ABS ring could be to blame. When it fails, it sends bad information to the control unit, and the traction system won?t engage. 4. Bad ABS Control UnitAbs Control Module CarThe ABS control unit is a microprocessor responsible for running diagnostic checks of the antilock braking system. It?s responsible for processing information from the speed sensors and the brake system to the central computer.When the ABS control unit fails, the slip light will trigger. The only way to get it off is to replace the control unit. 5. Bad Steering Angle SensorSteering Angle Sensor LocationThe steering angle sensor is responsible for measuring the position of the steering wheel and its rate of turning. It?s located in the steering column. There can be more than one angle sensor to ensure better data validation and redundancy.When one of these sensors fails, the slip light may come on. Additionally, the traction control system won?t be able to activate. 6. Bad WiringThe ABS and traction control system are made up of many different wires and connections that establish communication. When a wire becomes damaged or worn, it can cause a multitude of failures. The biggest problem with this fault is finding the broken wire. With so many wires involved, it can be hard to discover what?s wrong. "
How To Fix A Slip Light ?	"Once the slip light comes on, it?s time to figure out what?s wrong and fix it. If the light flashes on and off, there could be nothing wrong. Continue to drive to see if it acts up anymore. If it does, go ahead and follow these steps put together by our top mechanics.1. Read Trouble Codes From The ABS Control ModuleRead Trouble CodesAll modern vehicles are equipped with onboard diagnostics that tell you what?s wrong with your car. With a compatible OBDII code scanner, you can read the system?s faults. You need to have one that specifically reads the ABS control module, which isn?t all of them. Plug your code scanner into the diagnostic port found under the steering wheel. Read the DTCs and reference the information with our online trouble code library. Most trouble codes are universal, meaning every manufacturer uses the same code to signify a problem. However, there are some manufacturer-specific codes that could be more troublesome to figure out. If you are unsure how to repair the code, you may need to jump forward to step #5.2. Restart The Traction Control System With The ButtonTraction Control Off Button CarIf your vehicle is equipped with a VSC or Traction Control button, you can reset the system. Look for instructions in the owner?s manual. They probably look something like this.Place the car in Park.Push and hold the VSC button for five seconds.The traction control light and vehicle stability control light will turn on.Push and hold the VSC button again for five seconds. This should reset the system. If the light remains on, there is something bigger causing problems. If the light goes out, you are free to drive normally. 3. Check The Brake Fluid LevelThe ABS and traction control systems require optimal braking power to work. For this reason, it?s important for the brake fluid level to remain fully topped off.Check the brake fluid level to see how much is in the reservoir. If it is below the MAX line, add some more. Make sure you choose the right brake fluid for your vehicle. This information can be found in the owner?s manual. 4. Inspect The ABS Rings And Sensors For DamageLook in the service manual to figure out where the ABS rings are. Sometimes, you have to get inside the hub to see them. Once you get to the ABS rings, look for any signs of damage and replace them if needed. As far as the wheel sensors go, it?s much harder to find any damage. You may be able to clean them off and see if they reconnect better. Sometimes, dirt and grime build up on the sensors leading to trouble. 5. Contact A ProfessionalAt this point, it?s time to stop stressing and trust the professionals. Look for an ASE Certified Mechanic in your area that can help you diagnose and repair the slip light.If you aren?t sure who to trust, turn to the advice of people you know. You can also read the online reviews of local shops to see which is highly rated. We also recommend checking with the Better Business Bureau to ensure there haven?t been complaints with the company.

However, the cost to replace a sensor can be much higher, even up to $500 or more, if you need to have a mechanic install it. "
Can I drive with the slip light on?	"If the slip light comes on briefly, it simply means that the traction control system is working. You are fine to continue driving. If the light remains on, there could be a problem. While you will still be able to drive the car, you may not have the traction control system or ABS to fall back on. "
What does the ABS and slip light mean together?	"These two systems are intertwined, so any of the above failures can be to blame. It?s possible that the speed sensors, ABS rings, ABS control unit, steering angle sensor or wiring have failed, requiring replacement. The only way to know for sure is to perform a complete diagnosis."
Will low brake fluid cause a slip light?	"This isn?t a common occurrence, but it is possible. Because the traction control and ABS rely on the braking system, any lack of fluid can cause a malfunction. Thankfully, it?s easy to check the brake fluid and top it off if more is needed."
Conclusion	"The slip light might seem alarming, but it doesn?t need to be. In some cases, it can simply tell you that the system is working as it was intended. If the light doesn?t turn off, you know there?s something larger to take a look at. If you are mechanically inclined, you shouldn?t have a lot of trouble figuring it out. However, if you are unsure what you are working with, it?s best to trust a professional. Both the traction control system and ABS are important safety technologies that need to be in good working order. Otherwise, you may have trouble driving on slippery surfaces, so don?t take any chances. "
What Does The Service Battery Charging System Mean?	"With the Service Battery Charging System warning, you know there?s something wrong with the charging system. Considering the charging system includes the battery, alternator, wiring and electronic control unit (ECU), the fault could be with any of these components.When the charging system doesn?t function as it should, the battery could die. You may come out to your car to a dead battery or notice trouble getting power to the vital components of the car, such as the headlights. It?s very common to see the Service Battery Charging System warning message in Chevy, Buick, GMC, and other GM vehicles."
what are the Causes of Service Battery Charging System ?	"Any fault in the charging system can lead to this warning message. Therefore, the problem could be related to a bad alternator, a broken serpentine belt or a blown fuse. It could also be due to faulty wiring, a failing battery or a defective electronic control unit (ECU). Let?s describe each of these possibilities in detail. 1. Bad AlternatorCar AlternatorVery often, charging issues start with the alternator. The car alternator works as a type of generator. It?s responsible for charging the battery while the engine is running. As the engine runs, the alternator pushes out enough voltage to charge the battery and run the car accessories. When the voltage gets low, not only will the battery fail to charge, but you may notice trouble with the electronic equipment, such as the radio and the headlights. In some situations, the alternator can also provide too much voltage for the battery and electronics. High voltage leads to damage to the battery and it can cause the Check Engine Light to come on. It will also lead to blown fuses as the system attempts to protect itself. 2. Broken Serpentine BeltCheck Serpentine BeltThe serpentine belt is also known as the drive belt. It rotates through a series of pulleys to turn the alternator. When it?s running properly, the alternator is working any time that the engine is running.However, when the belt fails or wears down, the alternator can?t be powered on. Since we just discussed what happens when the alternator doesn?t work, you know the battery won?t charge. 3. Blown FuseFuse Box CarAs part of the electrical system, fuses protect the connections from overload. If too much power is sent through, a fuse will blow and power gets shut down. Most cars have two separate fuse boxes. There?s one under the steering wheel on the driver?s side of the cabin and another under the hood, otherwise known as the power distribution center. 4. Bad WiringBad WiringsWhat connects all of these parts together? Wiring and connectors are responsible for routing the power from part to part.Over time, wiring can fray or become damaged. Additionally, connectors can fail or become corroded. With a poor connection, the battery can?t get the charge that?s needed. Plus, when there?s a problem with the electrical system, you want to repair it right away before further glitches occur. 5. Bad BatteryThe first thing most people think about with a charging problem is the battery. The automotive battery is at the heart of the system, so it makes complete sense.Car batteries only last between three to five years on average, so it?s feasible that your car needs a replacement. As the battery starts to fail, you should get some warning signs, such as difficulty starting the car and dimmer headlights at night. If the car battery fails prematurely, there could be a larger electronic issue to troubleshoot. Instead of replacing car batteries repeatedly, it?s best to figure out what?s causing the failure, so it can be fixed. 6. Bad ECMRunning all of these components is the electronic control unit (ECU). This computer processor controls the battery, alternator and other electronics. If the computer fails or malfunctions, the charging voltage may not be adequate. This usually isn?t the problem, but still, something to look at if all of your other diagnosis ends up short. "
How To Fix The Service Battery Charging System Warning?	"The only way to tell what?s wrong with your car?s charging system is to complete a diagnostic check like professional mechanics. To get you started, we?ve outlined what we would do with our own vehicles. Here are some simple steps to follow after you read through your car?s factory service manual. 1. Check Serpentine BeltA visual inspection helps you determine the state of the serpentine belt. With the engine off, take a look at the belt to see if any part looks worn or torn. You can also check the tension of the belt by gently pushing down on it to see if any slack occurs.With too much slack or any damage, you must replace the serpentine belt. The belt snakes in and out of several components, so make a note of its path if you plan to do this replacement yourself. 2. Measure Charging VoltageAlternator TestYour next step is to check the voltage of the car battery and alternator. We recommend these steps.Turn on the car headlights for a minute to remove the surface charge.Set your multimeter to 20 volts.Turn the headlights off.Connect your multimeter to the positive (+) and negative (-) battery terminals.If the multimeter doesn?t read around 12.6 volts, the battery may be bad. Fire up the engine and measure the voltage again, and with the engine running, you should see at least 13.5 volts. Otherwise, there may be an issue with the alternator or related components.If you don?t have a multimeter or aren?t sure how to test your battery, take it to your local auto parts store. Many of the nationwide chains check batteries for free. They will also install a new one if you purchase it through them. 3. Scan CodesRead Trouble CodesWith warning lights on the dashboard or information center, you can check to see if the computer has set any codes. The diagnostic trouble codes help to determine what faults have occurred.Use an OBD2 scanner for this task. Once you pull the information, reference our trouble code library to figure out what?s wrong. This data should help you find the problem, so you can promptly fix it. 4. Inspect the Alternator and WiringSome people replace a car battery only to find out there is nothing wrong with it. A perfectly good battery only works if the alternator charges it. If the battery doesn?t receive a charge, it?s more likely that the alternator has failed.Additionally, you want to trace all of the wiring to see if anything is broken. Look at the fuse and replace it if it has blown. If the connection is corroded, you can clean this off with some baking soda and water. 5. Contact A ProfessionalEven the best of us get stumped at times. When this happens, it?s recommended to talk to a professional. Any auto repair shop may have more sophisticated tools and equipment, making it easier to determine what?s wrong. If you haven?t established a relationship with a repair shop yet, you need to ask around for recommendations. Your friends, family and online reviews all provide good resources. "

What Does The Check Charging System Warning Mean?	"With the Check Charging System warning in place, the alternator, battery, serpentine belt, fuse, wiring or engine control module (ECM) could be to blame. When it comes to charging the car battery, multiple components work together to ensure proper voltage.With any one of these components not working, the battery won?t be able to hold a charge. This problem could lead to a dead car battery in the morning or you may have trouble getting the necessary power to other parts, such as the vehicle?s headlights. "
what are the Causes of the Check Charging System Warning ?	"With the Check Charging System alert lit, you know the problem lies with one of the charging system?s components. It could be the alternator, serpentine belt, fuse, wiring, battery or the engine control module (ECM).As professional mechanics, we review what each of these means so you gain a better understanding of what?s happening. 1. Bad AlternatorAlternatorThe automotive alternator acts like a generator. Its main purpose is to keep the car battery charged any time that the motor is running. The alternator pushes out voltage to keep the battery juiced up. It also supplies power to various electronics when the car is running. The average alternator lasts for 80,000 to 150,000 miles.If the voltage drops, you?ll notice the battery dies. You?ll also see that the electronics fail to work normally. Most often, the headlights appear dimmer than normal. There are also times when the alternator fails and provides too much voltage. This problem damages the battery and the electronics. It can also cause a fuse to blow. 2. Broken Serpentine BeltSerpentine BeltThe drive belt, or serpentine belt, is responsible for powering the alternator. It moves through pulleys to run numerous accessories. This belt works any time that the motor is running. It?s designed to last for 100,000 miles when it?s properly maintained. Over time, this belt can wear down, even if you do nothing wrong. Once it fails completely, the alternator will no longer work. With a non-functioning alternator, the battery cannot charge. At first, you may think that the battery is dead when the alternator is really to blame. 3. Blown FuseBlown Car FuseTo protect the electrical system, the automaker installs a series of fuses. When a connection becomes overloaded, the fuse will blow instead of allowing any damage to occur. Once a fuse is blown, the power will fail to the flow freely.Cars have two different fuse locations. The most accessible location is on the driver?s side of the interior, under the steering wheel. There?s also a power distribution center located under the hood. 4. Bad WiringBroken WiringsConnecting all of these valuable components, a series of wiring runs between them. There are also connectors between the parts, leaving more room for failure.If the wires get damaged or start to fray, the power connection will be interrupted. It?s also possible for the connectors to fail or experience corrosion. If power can?t run through the wires, the battery can?t get charged, thereby causing the light to come on. 5. Bad BatteryIt?s common to think that the battery is the culprit. After all, this is the most known part of the charging system. Without a car battery, you wouldn?t be able to start the car. Considering these parts only last around three to five years, you may need to replace one. When the battery begins to fail, you?ll first notice trouble getting the engine running. You may also have trouble running various accessories, such as the headlights or car radio. If the battery is dying before it should, there could be a larger issue. Don?t keep replacing batteries without first figuring out what?s causing the problem. 6. Bad ECMThe Engine Control Module (ECM) runs all of the vital components. It takes information from various sensors and uses it to keep things balanced. When the computer fails, strange things can occur with the charging voltage. Additionally, warning lights can appear, including the Check Engine message. It can also lead to unrelated failures. Because these computers control many things, you want to have them looked at right away. "
How To Fix The Check Charging System Message ?	"Before you can fix what?s wrong with the charging system, you must diagnose it first. If you have some mechanical knowledge, you can gain a lot of answers from the factory service manual. Aside from that, we recommend these steps. 1. Check Serpentine BeltCheck Serpentine BeltYou can perform a visual check on the serpentine belt to see if it is damaged. Look for signs of wearing or fraying. It?s also possible to check on its tension by pushing on it gently. If you notice an excessive amount of slack, it?s time to replace the belt.Before you take the old belt off, take a picture of how it goes on. You can also find a diagram in the service manual. These belts can weave through a lot of components, making the installation complicated. 2. Measure Charging VoltageAlternator TestIt?s also important to check on the battery voltage. With a multimeter, you can do this procedure quickly.Turn on the headlights and let them run for a minute. This step ensures the surface charge is removed.Set up your multimeter to the 20 volt option.Turn off the headlights.Connect the multimeter to the corresponding negative and positive terminals on the battery.Read the voltage.

What Does The Service Safety Restraint System Warning Mean?	"When the Service Safety Restraint System (SRS) warning light comes on, you know that something within the Airbag system has malfunctioned. The problem could be with an airbag or the seat pretensioner. Either one may not engage during an accident, leading to possible fatal injuries.The first commercial airbags were included in cars back in 1971, but not with a lot of success at first. Seat belt pretensioners were also introduced into the market by Mercedes-Benz, first appearing in the S-Class. Today, both of these systems make up what?s known as the Safety Restraint System (SRS). Airbags and seat belt pretensioners work together to ensure superior safety when an accident occurs. The pretensioners lock the seat belt and tighten it when hard braking and an impact occur. In conjunction, the airbag deploys when that collision occurs, further keeping you from hitting your head on the dashboard or windshield. This system prevents numerous injuries and is invaluable to your daily travels. "
what are the Causes of the Service Safety Restraint System Warning ?	"As soon as a warning comes on for the Safety Restraint System, you know there?s a problem affecting either the airbags or seat belt pretensioners. Figuring out where the problem lies is another issue. It could be with the airbag, clock spring, sensors, wiring or computer.1. Faulty Air BagFaulty AirbagYou should never have to wonder if the airbag is bad. Today?s cars have internal sensors that let you know if the airbag becomes defective. The internal mechanisms are constantly monitoring the health of the airbag.If the airbag is defective and the warning light comes on, your airbags may not deploy during an accident. For this reason alone, you want to take the warning seriously. It?s even more important to look into defects if your vehicle may be included in the Takata airbag recalls. 2. Bad Clock SpringAirbag Clock SpringThe clock spring is responsible for keeping the electrical connection from the steering wheel to the various sensors it uses. So, even when you are turning the steering wheel in all directions, the connection is supposed to remain solid. However, the clock spring can fail over time. When this happens, the Service SRS warning light or SRS light comes on. You may also lose the functionality of the steering wheel buttons. You may also lose the function of the horn, which means you won?t be able to beep at all of the crazy drivers. What?s even scarier is that without the clock spring, the connection with the airbag is interrupted and you won?t have the protection you need during an accident. Other warning lights can also occur when the clock spring fails. You may see a traction control light or the Check Engine Light. When you check the codes later in the article, just make sure you double-check that all of the lights are related to the same fault. 3. Bad Airbag SensorThe airbag sensor is responsible for detecting any abrupt stop of the vehicle that would indicate a crash is occurring. Based on how fast that stop is occurring and at what force the impact is, the sensor determines if the airbag needs to deploy. The sensors for the main airbags are normally found behind the bumper.The only way to know that the sensor is bad is when the warning light comes on. There are no other symptoms that will occur other than the airbag will not deploy because of the lack of communication. 4. Wiring IssueAll of the parts that we?ve been discussing are connected through an intricate system of wires. These wires plug into various connectors, so everything can communicate among the system.Over time, wires naturally degrade, leading to fraying and damage. Additionally, connectors can go bad or corrode, most often occurring when moisture gets into the system. If the electrical system running the airbags is to blame, the light comes on and the airbags fail to work. 5. Faulty Seat Occupancy SensorWith a passenger-side airbag, the seat is equipped with a sensor that works with the SRS. This sensor lets the computer know if someone is sitting in the seat. If there?s not anyone there, the system won?t deploy the airbag during an accident.However, this sensor can malfunction. When it does, the SRS alert is signaled and you get a message to service the system. 6. Faulty SRS ComputerThis entire system is run by a computer, as are most things in today?s cars. While these computers are built to last the lifetime of a vehicle, they aren?t immune to damage.Excessive vibration, old age and corrosion can cause the SRS computer to fail prematurely. Once the computer is done, the warning comes on to alert you to the fault. "
How To Fix The Service Safety Restraint System Warning Message ?	"What do you do once this light comes on? Should you attempt to fix the problem yourself or take it to a repair shop? This question can only be answered by you. In some ways, it?s simple to fix the SRS fault, especially if you have some mechanical knowledge. On the other hand, only ASE Certified Mechanics should handle certain aspects of the system. Let?s talk more about this in detail. Consider these steps to figure out the problem. 1. Scan the CodesScan Trouble Codes CarWith this SRS light on, there?s a code set in the computer. You can read this code if you have a compatible scanner. Most low-dollar scanners are not going to read this system. When purchasing a code scanner, make sure you opt for one that can read the SRS faults.Once you retrieve the codes from the system, you may require help deciphering the meaning. That?s where our trouble code library comes in to save the day. 2. Diagnose the Airbag SystemThe airbag system is made up of numerous sensors, electrical connections and a main computer. When a fault occurs, trying to find the problem can be difficult, especially if you aren?t experienced. Without in-depth knowledge of the airbag system, you could get yourself into a lot of trouble trying to get to the bottom of the problem. For this reason, we usually recommend moving right onto step #3. 3. Contact a ProfessionalHopefully, you have a trusted mechanic that you already use when there?s a problem outside of your scope of expertise. If so, now is the time to contact them and schedule an appointment. This system is too delicate for novice mechanics.If you are visiting a new mechanic that you don?t have experience with, be careful. It?s important to choose someone that is certified and well-versed in the airbag system. After all, this is your life we are talking about. "
What does it mean when my car says service safety restraint system?	"This warning is telling you that there?s a fault in the Safety Restraint System (SRS). This system contains both the airbags and the seat belt pre-tensioner. There could be a physical malfunction with these parts, or it could be related to the sensors or wiring. "
How much does it cost to fix the service safety restraint system light?	"Many of these issues cost a decent amount to repair, especially if you need a professional mechanic to perform the labor. On average, expect to spend between $75 and $1,750, with the sensors and computer costing the most to fix. "
Can I still drive with the service SRS light on?	"There?s nothing stopping you from driving with the Service SRS alert on. Your car will still operate as normal and you won?t notice any performance issues. However, with this light illuminated, the airbags aren?t going to deploy. You are putting yourself in danger if an accident should occur. "
How do I reset the service SRS light?	"The only way to reset the Service SRS light is to fix the problem causing the fault. Once you diagnose and repair the system, you can use a compatible code scanner to erase the codes. The light should remain off permanently. If it doesn?t, you know the problem hasn?t been resolved or there are other issues."
Conclusion	"While some warning lights in the car are not nearly as important, the Service Safety Restraint System is not one of them. You must pay close attention to this SRS warning, especially if you want to be protected during a collision. Without it, the airbags and seat belt pretensioners may not work properly. The fix for these faults can be pricey. We completely understand how easy it would be to neglect a repair because money is tight, but you need to think about what your life is worth. If you were to become seriously injured, what would you lose? Chances are that it will be far more than what you would have spent to fix your car. Don?t take anything for granted. Schedule a repair today."
What Does The SVC Tire Monitor Warning Mean?	"The SVC Tire Monitor message means that either the tire pressure is low or there?s a fault with the monitoring system. You may see a picture that looks like a tire with an exclamation mark in the middle, along with a written message to get your attention.Some vehicles go as far as letting you know how much air pressure is in each tire. In general, these messages appear once the tires have 25% less than the recommended air pressure. Additionally, if the vital components of the system fail, incorrect data might be sent, thereby causing the alarm to come on. It?s common to see this warning message on many Chevrolet models, such as the Chevy Malibu, Cobalt, or HHR. You can also find it on other GM vehicles."
what are  the Causes of an SVC Tire Monitor Warning ?	"Once the SVC Tire Monitor warning comes on, you know that there?s something going on with the tires or the monitoring system. Your problem could be lost memory in the sensor or that it?s faulty. You may have also changed the wheels without resetting the system or possibly have low tire pressure. Let?s review all of these options in-depth.1. Tire Pressure Sensor Lost MemoryTire Pressure SensorThe TPMS sensor can lose connection with the main system. This happens because of low battery voltage or any other system interruption.Without a connection, the computer believes there?s something wrong with the tire pressure. For this reason, the system recognizes a fault and the service light comes on. 2. Faulty Tire Pressure SensorThere?s also the possibility that the tire pressure sensor went bad. Because of where the sensors are located, they are prone to failure. Dirt, debris and road grime are constantly being thrown against the sensors. It?s even worse if you drive down unpaved dirt roads. Add in the vibration and you are looking at even more frequent damage.On average, the TPMS sensors should go five to ten years without needing to be changed. Thankfully, the repair isn?t overly complicated. 3. Changed Wheels Without ResetChange Wheels CarIt can be fun to upgrade the wheels for something more stylish. You may also find that different wheels are needed for use with your winter tires. Either way, it?s important that new sensors are installed with these wheels to monitor the tire pressures. If you don?t put sensors on the rims, the system will see a fault. Additionally, when the sensors are installed, they will need to be calibrated. 4. Tire Pressure Sensor Not ResetThe tire pressure sensors must be calibrated to work with the main sensors. If the connection is lost, they need to be recalibrated.The same is true when new wheels are installed. Either way, a tire sensor that wasn?t reset and calibrated is going to throw an alarm in the system. 5. Low Tire PressureAbove all, the most common reason for the TPMS light and the Service Tire Pressure warning is that one of the tires isn?t inflated properly. If the tires have lost air, the system is working just as it should.Driving with low tire pressure is dangerous. Over time, the tires naturally leak a little air. Plus, temperature changes affect tire pressure. Otherwise, there could be a puncture in the tire that?s allowing air to leak out. "
How To Fix A SVC Tire Monitor Message ?	"If you have some basic tools and mechanical knowledge, you may be able to repair the fault on your own. Before you get started, read the factory service manual for any manufacturer-specific directions. Once you?ve brushed up on the basics, follow these steps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. Inflate or Deflate the TiresInflate TireBefore you do anything else, make sure the tires have the correct air pressure. If it?s too high or too low, the sensors could be on. This is the simplest fix, so it?s the best place to start. To find the right amount of air pressure for your vehicle, look in the owner?s manual. Otherwise, the amounts are also listed on the driver?s side door jamb. There?s a card with all of the vehicle information, including how much the tires should be inflated. With a tire pressure gauge, you can perform this check right at home. It?s best to check the pressures before driving the vehicle when the tires are still cool. If you have a portable air compressor or tire inflator, you can also add air without going anywhere. Otherwise, you will have to visit a local gas station or service center to get air. 2. Reset The Tire Pressure LightOnce you add air to your tires, the light should automatically reset. If it doesn?t, you may need to manually reset it. One of these methods may work.Drive for ten minutes at 50 mph or more. Once you stop and restart the car, the light should be reset.Turn the key to the ON position, but don?t start the vehicle. If your car has a TPMS reset button below the steering wheel, push it three times and let go. Start the car and let it run for twenty minutes.Inflate the tires to three more PSI than what?s recommended. Deflate the tires. Do this with the spare as well, just in case it has a sensor. After deflating the tires, refill to the recommended level to reset the light.Disengage the positive cable on the battery with the vehicle off. This will reset your clock, radio presets and other electronic functions. Turn on the key and wait. This should drain the remaining power to reset the sensor light. Hook the battery up and try again. If none of these methods work, you may need to jump to step #5. A professional may have another procedure that?s specifically meant for your vehicle. 3. Read Trouble CodesIf other lights are on the dash, there could be something larger going on. For example, if the traction control light or Check Engine Light are illuminated, you want to find out what?s happening.With a compatible code scanner, you can read the system. Then, cross-reference the information with our online trouble code library and fix whatever problems exist. 4. Reprogram Tire Pressure SensorsTpms Sensor ProgrammingIf you swap out wheels or get new sensors installed, they must be reprogrammed. If you have a TPMS calibration tool, you can do this at home.You may also be able to get the sensors to connect by following one of our relearn procedures listed above. Otherwise, it?s time to bite the bullet and move to the next step.5. Contact A ProfessionalIf you have a local tire shop, it might be time to visit for help. Your tire shop mechanics have the tools and equipment to diagnose and fix the problem quickly. The cost of repair depends on what?s wrong. On average, it may cost $50 to $150 to replace and calibrate one sensor. On some vehicles, a replacement can be slightly more complicated. "
Can I drive with the SVC tire monitor warning on?	"There?s nothing stopping you from driving even though the monitor is on. Your car will physically run. However, it?s not safe to drive with low tire pressure. The tires can blow out and cause an accident. Even if the pressure is right, you won?t know if something else goes wrong with the system while the light is on."
How do I reset my SVC tire monitor warning?	"First, you want to fix whatever is causing it. Once the problem is resolved, the warning may reset on its own. Otherwise, reset procedures should be laid out in your factory service manual since they can be manufacturer-specific. If you need more help, visit a local tire shop. "
How much does it cost to fix a tire monitor system?	"It?s free to add air if you have a compressor or inflator at home. Otherwise, if you need to have a tire sensor replaced and recalibrated, you may spend $50 to $150 for each one. This cost is on top of any other work you have done, such as getting new wheels."
How long do tire monitor sensors last?	"Tire pressure sensors are meant to last five to ten years in normal conditions. Because the sensors sit on the wheel, they are prone to premature failure if you drive down dirt roads. Any grime, mud and debris can lead to early wear, along with excessive amounts of vibration. "
Conclusion	"It?s important that you take the SVC Tire Monitor warning seriously. This important alert is trying to tell you that the tires are either improperly inflated or there?s an issue with the sensor. Either way, your drive could be in danger. Remember that your car tires are the only part of the vehicle actually touching the road. Therefore, it?s more important than ever to consider the health of the tires and their corresponding sensors.As professional mechanics, we can tell you how much damage and even accidents we?ve seen caused by improper tire inflation. Don?t be another one of the statistics. Take action at the first sign of a problem. "
What Does The Braking Power Low Mean On My Toyota?	"The Braking Power Low message on a Toyota comes on when the braking system isn?t getting the vacuum it needs. Modern Toyota vehicles use a separate vacuum pump to build up the vacuum, and if the pressure is not enough, it will illuminate this light.With a lack of power in the braking system, it can be more difficult to push the pedal down or it may feel very stiff. Additionally, you may not have the braking power required to stop your vehicle in time. With older brake systems, problems were often related simply to the brake pads, rotors or fluid. That?s no longer the case. Now, with all of the electronic equipment and vacuum configuration, you see there?s much more that can go wrong. "
what are the Causes Of Braking Power Low Toyota ?	"When the Braking Power Low message comes on on a Toyota Highlander or Camry, it could be due to a failed vacuum pump, cracked hoses, a malfunctioning brake booster, or a faulty ABS control module. Let?s examine these options in-depth.1. Faulty Vacuum Pump (Safety Recall Toyota Camry)The vacuum pump is responsible for removing all of the air in the booster. This action creates the vacuum power that?s needed to maximize the braking action. With this vacuum power, you need to apply less pressure to the pedal to stop the car. Therefore, if the pump fails, there?s going to be less braking power. Toyota vehicles are prone to this type of failure. As an example, there?s a 2018-2019 Toyota Camry recall because of the loss of power braking assist due to defective pumps. You will also see the same issue with Toyota Highlander models.2. Bad Vacuum HosesJust as the engine uses vacuum hoses to direct the air for combustion, the modern braking system also contains vacuum lines. These hoses are responsible for supplying the vacuum power needed for the brakes to work.As with any hoses and lines, cracks and kinks can form over time. When this occurs, the vacuum is interrupted and the brakes lose power. After all, a vacuum can?t exist if the air is leaking out of one spot.4. Faulty Brake BoosterBrake BoosterWhen the brake booster fails, it can cause a lot of different issues. Some people experience the fault as a spongy feeling to the brakes, which is often caused by a leak in vacuum pressure.However, the bad brake booster can also create reduced power, leading to a feeling that the brakes are sticking or dragging. In this case, the problem may be a damaged piston or seal. Either way, you want to have it fixed immediately. 5. Faulty ABS Control ModuleABS stands for the anti-lock brake system. The ABS control module regulates braking power by opening and closing the booster valves. This system can malfunction and activate when it shouldn?t. This problem is easy to figure out since ABS will activate at random times, creating trouble braking. You may also get a warning light about the ABS system on your dashboard. "
How To Fix The Braking Power Low Warning On A Toyota ?	"Once you?ve recognized that there?s a problem with the braking power on your Toyota, it?s time to take action. You don?t want to mess around with braking issues for too long because this creates safety concerns. We recommend that you have a factory service manual for your Toyota. With the information listed there, you may be able to diagnose and repair the problem. Here are a few other steps to consider.1. Read Trouble CodesScan Trouble Codes CarWhen a fault occurs in today?s vehicles, a trouble code is set by the main computer. These codes can be retrieved by using a compatible OBDII scanner. Plug your scanner into the port under the steering wheel to pull the codes from the system.In most cases, the code is going to mean nothing to the untrained eye. That?s why you want to use our trouble code library to understand the meaning behind the fault. With this information, you may be able to resolve the problem quickly. 2. Look for Technical Service Bulletins and Safety RecallsThe technical service bulletin is sent from the car manufacturer to dealerships alerting them of a mechanical issue. These bulletins are free to the public, allowing you to see what issues occur with your vehicle. These also give you a chance to see what fix might be recommended. Some of these defects will turn into safety recalls, which are repaired for free at dealerships. The best way to find both the technical service bulletins and safety recalls for your vehicle is to use the NHTSA website. On this site, you enter your car?s VIN and all of the relevant information will be available to you. 3. Inspect the Vacuum Pump and VacuumYou can diagnose a faulty vacuum pump with a special gauge. You want to compare the proper steps and readings with your service manual to make sure everything is in order.Additionally, it?s important to inspect all of the lines, hoses and connections. You never know when one small defect will be found that?s causing all of the problems. You also want to ensure there are no leaks in the brake booster.The vacuum pump on Toyota Highlander and Camry are located on the backside of the cylinder head.4. Contact a ProfessionalIf you can?t figure out what?s wrong or you need help with the repair, reach out to a local mechanic in your area. If you don?t know how to find a repair shop, talk to your family and friends about who they use. It?s important to choose an ASE-Certified Mechanic that has the training and skills to work on these complicated matters. Ask for proof of certification and avoid trusting your car to anyone that simply calls themself a mechanic. "
What causes loss of braking power?	"In today?s Toyota models, the problem generally occurs in the vacuum system. A failed vacuum pump, cracked hoses, a malfunctioning brake booster or a faulty ABS control module may be to blame. The only way to know for sure is to visit a qualified mechanic that can diagnose the system. "
What does the braking power low warning mean?	"This warning message indicates that braking power isn?t normal with the power assist. Without this added braking power, the pedal may feel spongy or hard to depress. You may also lose braking ability, causing it to take longer to stop once you step on the pedal. "
How do I fix low brake pressure?	"First, you should read the trouble codes in the computer. If there?s a fault that can be fixed, start with that. After clearing the codes, you should check for a vacuum leak or trouble with the power assist system. If you are unsuccessful, a trip to a local repair shop may be in order. "
Why is my brake pedal going so low when I stop?	"With sophisticated power assist braking systems, the problem often lies in the vacuum. Either a part has failed or a hose is leaking. Otherwise, common braking issues can also be to blame, such as bad pads, defective rotors or low brake fluid. Have the system checked by a professional. "
Conclusion	"Nothing is scarier than losing valuable braking power when driving. With any change to the brake pedal, we also get alarmed and sometimes panic. However, panicking isn?t going to fix this problem and it could potentially make it worse. Even as professional mechanics, we have to remind ourselves of this fact whenever we deal with a personal braking fault. Be safe and wise by having the system checked immediately. You don?t want to drive with malfunctioning brakes and it?s not fair to others on the road. Yes, it may cost you a little money to have the system repaired, but it?s a drop in the bucket compared to what you will spend after an accident you could have avoided. "
What Does The VTM-4 Light On My Honda Pilot Mean?	"The VTM-4 light indicates that the torque management system is active, allowing the Honda Pilot to drive across difficult terrain. It could also indicate an issue with the VTM-4 system, but in many cases, this light doesn?t indicate that anything is wrong other than the system is activated.If the light remains active while driving across normal roads, the VTM-4 might be engaged when you don?t want it to be. If it remains engaged, the rear differential can suffer abnormal wear, leading to unnecessary repairs. You can also hear strange noises and feel unusual vibrations when this system is in use abnormally. The VTM-4 system is an advanced all-wheel drive configuration designed to work in numerous ways. You will usually find this system in Honda Pilot, Acura, and Ridgeline. When driving on normal roads, the system disengages on its own. Full engine power is routed to the front wheels and the rear wheels spin independently, creating a fuel-efficient ride. Basically, the car operates as if it was a front-wheel-drive platform. If the wheels start to spin at different rates or there is any slippage, the system works differently. In this case, the rear clutch packs locks, so power is sent to the rear wheels for better traction. This system automatically engages when driving across snow, mud or other slippery terrain. During this time, the all-wheel drive is activated, so fuel economy will drop slightly. If you activate the VTM-4 lock manually, the system doesn?t wait for slippage to occur. Instead, the clutch packs remain engaged until you turn the system back to automatic operation. It?s not usually recommended to use the system this way unless you are heading off-road."
what are the  Causes Of The VTM-4 Light on Honda Pilot ?	"If the system isn?t activated, but you still see the VTM-4 light, it?s time to figure out why the light is on. A sensor could be to blame or there could be a transmission issue. It?s also possible that some wiring is defective or you have a bad rear differential clutch. Let?s examine these possibilities in-depth.1. Faulty Engine SensorCar Engine SensorsWith today?s Honda vehicles, sensors are working to keep everything in order. Engine sensors are used to maintain appropriate fuel consumption, horsepower, emissions and more. If an engine sensor fails or malfunctions, it starts to send out the wrong information.With this incorrect data, systems alter how they operate to compensate for what is perceived, even if it?s wrong. Depending on what engine sensors have failed, the VTM-4 system could be one that malfunctions.2. Faulty ABS Wheel Speed SensorAbs SensorThe ABS wheel speed sensor is needed for exactly what it sounds like. These sensors measure the speed of the wheels, so the traction control, torque management and anti-lock brake systems can determine how to operate. If a wheel speed sensor fails, the data being sent back to the system is going to be incorrect. Therefore, the VTM-4 system may activate even if it?s not needed. 3. Transmission IssuesThe transmission and VTM-4 system work in conjunction with one another at all times. That?s why transmission problems can cause the VTM-4 light to come on. For starters, it?s important to have the right amount of transmission fluid. If the fluid gets low, the systems aren?t going to work properly. There?s also the problem of having contaminated fluid. Once it becomes burnt or old, the transmission can?t provide the support required. 4. Bad Rear Differential Clutch or SensorsThe rear differential clutch allows the wheels to lock when additional traction is needed. If the clutch fails, only one wheel will spin instead of both or they will remain locked when they shouldn?t be. Additionally, the clutch is run by sensors that can go bad. Any of these issues is known for turning on the VTM-4 light. 5. Wiring IssuesAll of these sensors and parts are connected by wires. As with any electrical system, when wires degrade, trouble is sure to follow.It isn?t just the wires you need to consider. Sometimes, the connectors are to blame, especially if corrosion and wear set in. Your Honda Pilot service manual will help you understand the wiring configuration if this is something that you need to look closer at. "
How To Fix The VTM-4 Light On A Honda Pilot ?	"In normal conditions, there?s no reason to fix the VTM-4 light. It?s simply coming on to let you know that the system is activated. However, if the light doesn?t go away when it should, it?s time to start diagnostics. Here are a few steps to consider.1. Check VTM-4 Lock ButtonHonda PilotThe VTM-4 lock is normally automatic. It?s going to turn on and off as needed, based on the road conditions. However, there?s a way to manually turn the lock on, which is helpful if you are off-roading. If the light remains on when it shouldn?t be, it?s possible that you left the system manually engaged. All you need to do is press the VTM-4 Lock button and see if the light turns off. This would place the system back into automatic mode. If the light doesn?t go off, move on with the other steps. 2. Read Trouble Codes (All Control Modules)Scan Trouble Codes CarWhen there?s a fault with the sensors or systems in today?s cars, the computer sets what is known as an onboard diagnostic trouble code. With a compatible code scanner, you can read these codes and figure out what?s wrong. However, with the traction control and ABS, you will need a good scanner. Not all of the scanners read the codes from every control module. Once you pull the information from the computer, make sure you reference it with our trouble code library to see what?s going on. 3. Diagnose the IssueIf you?ve pulled the codes but are still having trouble getting the light to go out, it?s time to look through the possible causes above and investigate them further. With the understanding that the VTM-4 system works through the wheels, transmission and other components, there are a lot of aspects to consider.You can start by examining the wiring. If anything is broken, cracked or worn, it?s time to replace it. You may also consider the air pressure in your tires. Because the speed of each wheel is being measured, there?s a chance that inaccurate pressure is to blame. Fill up the tires to the recommended PSI, as listed on the driver?s side door jamb. 4. Contact a ProfessionalWhen you?ve done all you can without any success, it?s time to wave the white flag. Visit your local auto repair shop for more support. With advanced tools and equipment, the certified mechanics will be able to tell you what?s wrong and offer a comprehensive quote for the repair.If you don?t have a relationship with a mechanic, ask your friends and family who they use. You can also read online reviews to see who the locals trust. "
How do I clear the VTM-4 light?	"If the VTM-4 light doesn?t go off automatically, make sure you don?t have the system manually engaged. Beyond that, there could be a problem with a sensor, the transmission, wiring or ABS that needs to be repaired before the system will deactivate. "
How do I  turn off the VTM-4 light on a Honda Pilot?	"If you?ve manually engaged the VTM-4 system, press the VTM-4 button in to unlock it. The light should disappear. If it doesn?t, there?s a problem with one of the components. We recommend having it checked by a professional to ensure no further damage occurs. "
Can I drive with the VTM-4 light on?	"If you are driving on slippery road surfaces, it?s normal for the VTM-4 light to come on. It simply indicates that all-wheel-drive is activated for better traction. If it?s on while driving on normal road surfaces, you want to have the system checked before driving too much further. "
When should I change the VTM-4 fluid in my Honda Pilot?	"The VTM-4 fluid should be changed regularly to ensure proper operation. Check your Honda Pilot owner?s manual to determine what?s recommended based on the model year you drive. For most Honda vehicles, the recommendation is to change it every 15,000 miles. "
Conclusion	"You may not be used to seeing the VTM-4 light on your Honda Pilot, especially if you don?t drive on rough roads. To be honest, it?s a light that doesn?t come on frequently, so even our top mechanics aren?t extremely familiar with. However, the times we have diagnosed this light, it?s usually caused by an engine issue, such as a bad engine sensor that needs to be diagnosed with a compatible scanner.If the light comes on while driving across a slippery surface, it?s doing exactly what it is supposed to. If the light stays on, there?s a problem and you should have it checked out. If you don?t fix it, additional wear and tear will be put on the differential, only leading to more repairs in the future.

"The Service Shifter warning indicates there is an issue with the shifter in your SUV and it?s time to get it serviced by a professional mechanic. It?s been a common problem with Cherokee models, with various causes leading to the malfunction. In most cases, this problem is not an emergency. You may be able to prolong the repair for a short time. However, if you drive some models, it?s considered dangerous. There have been multiple recalls and lawsuits related to the failure. Let?s take a closer look at what might be going on. "
what are the Causes Of A Service Shifter Warning on Jeep Cherokee ?	"If you see a Service Shifter warning message on your Jeep Cherokee?s dashboard, you may find that the shifter has gone bad. There?s also a chance that the software requires an update, the wiring to the shifter is bad or the brake light switch has failed. Either way, you can gain more understanding by looking at the causes in-depth.1. Bad Shifter ElectronicsShifter Jeep Grand CherokeeWhen the shifter light comes on, it could be because of the bezel around the shifter itself. If this part that surrounds the knob becomes warped or cracked, the system may not be able to communicate properly. There?s also the chance that the shifter needs to be replaced. A bad shifter can also lead to trouble moving out of Park or between gears.2. Software Needs an UpdateModern vehicles run with the help of electronics and software. It?s akin to a computer system on a larger scale. Just like regular computers require updates from time to time, the car may also require an update. The difference is that today?s vehicles have multiple computers working together in harmony for the perfect ride. Sadly, these updates aren?t as easy to complete as they sound. You will need to take your vehicle to a dealership or shop with the appropriate tools, which we will talk more about in the next section. 3. Bad Shifter WiringAs an electronic system, you can guarantee there?s wiring involved. All of this wiring runs through the fuse box, which could be the heart of the issue.A blown fuse can cause communication errors with the shifter. Additionally, any damaged wire or poor connection between the shifter and the computer can cause the same problems. 4. Bad Brake Light SwitchA bad brake light switch isn?t the typical cause of the problem, but should still be mentioned. When the brake light switch malfunctions, the obvious issues are going to involve the light not illuminating in the back of the vehicle.Some drivers also find that it causes warning lights on the screen. One of these warnings is the Service Shifter message. How To Fix The Service Shifter Message On A Jeep CherokeeRealizing what?s causing the problem is only half of the steps. Once the issue has been identified, it?s time to take action. On some rare occurrences, you may be able to fix this yourself, such as with a blown fuse. Otherwise, you?ll probably need some more help to get the job done. Here are a few steps to consider after you?ve read through the factory service manual to gain a better understanding of your Jeep Cherokee. 1. Look for Technical Service Bulletins and RecallsRecall LetterA technical service bulletin is a message written from the auto manufacturer to the dealership technicians. These bulletins provide a wealth of information because they tell the techs how to repair known problems. Some of them provide step-by-step directions, making it very simple for the household mechanic to complete some jobs.One example you may find interesting is a Service shifter bulletin for Jeep you can find here.You can find the technical service bulletins for your vehicle on the NHTSA website. You must punch in your model year and make to see what?s available. The trouble with reading some of the bulletins is that they are written with a professional technician in mind. If you don?t have this experience, you may be at a loss for what to do.Additionally, the NHTSA provides recalls on vehicles. With the Jeep Cherokee models, some have some serious recalls that should be addressed immediately. For example, with the 2014 Jeep Cherokee, there are three incredibly dangerous powertrain recalls. Not only can the power transfer unit input splines break, leading to a loss of Drive, but a stuck transmission clutch can cause the same problem. There?s even a recall showing that the transmission may shift itself into Neutral. None of these are issues you want to play around with. 2. Contact the Dealership for WarrantiesIf your vehicle isn?t that old, it may still be under the factory warranty. If so, whatever repairs are needed will be done at the expense of the automaker, with nothing to pay out of pocket. The trouble with factory warranties is that you can often wait a while for repairs. In some cases, the dealership may not provide a loaner vehicle while the SUV is done, which can be a real inconvenience.Even if your vehicle has surpassed its life in the factory warranty, you may have signed up for an extended warranty that could provide coverage. These are often offered at the time you purchase your vehicle, but you can sign up any time that?s convenient for you. With a third-party car warranty, you can usually get service without going to the dealer, which may be better suited to your busy schedule. Just be careful when choosing what company to go with, as the Federal Trade Commission claims many people are scammed each year.  3. Update Shifter SoftwareThe Transmission Control Module (TCM) is responsible for controlling automatic transmissions. Various sensors report information back to this vital module, so adjustments can be made for the transmission to work as intended. Data is also provided from the Engine Control Unit (ECU) to calculate when gears should be shifted for the best ride comfort and fuel economy.If the system fails, an update may help solve the problem. However, most people don?t have the equipment needed to update the software. Instead, you may have to visit a local dealership, which, again, puts you at the mercy of their schedule. It?s also not the cheapest fix to complete. 4. Diagnose and Replace the ShifterIf the bezel around the shifter requires a replacement, you aren?t looking at a lot of money. You should also be able to perform this repair at home with some basic tools.On the other hand, it?s not always easy to replace a shifter when it fails. You may find this a job better suited for a professional mechanic with better tools. After all, you don?t want to make the problem any worse by making a novice mistake. "

What Does The Stop Vehicle Leave Engine Running Message Mean On A Mercedes Benz?	"A malfunction on the Mercedes-Benz dash that says, ?Stop the vehicle shift to P, leave the engine running,? means that there?s low battery voltage. However, the cause of the low voltage can be various things, forcing you to perform a complete diagnosis to figure out what?s wrong.The Stop Vehicle Leave Engine Running alert can happen on any modern Mercedes from the model year 2015 and newer. It doesn?t matter if you drive a C300, C43 AMG, GLA, G-Class or E300. If you leave the engine running for ten minutes, the message may reset automatically because the battery will have charged to its appropriate level. However, you still need to get to the heart of the issue if you want to prevent this from occurring again. "
Causes Of Stop Vehicle Leave Engine Running Warning on Mercedes Benz ?	"The root issue of this Mercedes-Benz warning is low voltage, but there are multiple things that can cause it. You may simply have a discharged battery or it could be bad. Additionally, a failing alternator or bad wiring can cause the same problems. Here are the four most common reasons for this Mercedes warning message. 1. Discharged BatteryBattery Light On 1The automotive battery is responsible for starting the engine and running the electronics. This 12V battery gets recharged as the vehicle runs, thanks to the help of the alternator. However, if you accidentally leave the headlights on or you are running accessories without the engine on, the battery could discharge.The battery can also discharge if you have stored the vehicle without installing it to a maintainer or trickle charger. If the car isn?t driven enough to keep the battery charged, it?s going to fail you at some point. 2. Bad Main or Auxiliary BatteryIf the battery seems to fail even though you are driving enough, it could be old and in need of a replacement. Most car batteries only last three to five years, even under the best circumstances. Most Mercedes Benz vehicles use two batteries, the main and the auxiliary battery. If any of these batteries fail, it could lead to this warning message which we will talk more about later in the article.Typically, there are warning signs that the battery is dying. It will become harder to start the engine. Plus, the lights can become dimmer and the accessories may start acting erratically. 3. Bad AlternatorAlternator CarAs we touched on earlier, the battery gets charged while driving because of the car alternator. If this part fails, the battery can?t be recharged. Many people don?t realize that the alternator has failed until they?ve replaced the battery and had the same result.Most alternators will last more than 100,000 miles. You shouldn?t have to replace the alternator sooner than every seven years in the majority of cases. 4. Bad WiringThe battery and alternator are all part of an electrical system that must be maintained. For starters, the battery terminals can become corroded, leading to a connection problem. Battery corrosion keeps the connection from being secure, causing all kinds of trouble with starting and running accessories. Additionally, there are wires and connectors running from the alternator to the battery and the battery to the starter. If any of these connections fail, there will be voltage issues that could cause the Mercedes warning light. "
How To Fix A Stop Vehicle Leave Engine Running Message On A Mercedes Benz?	"In most cases, the Stop Vehicle Leave Engine Running alert is nothing major and you don?t need to worry. If it?s related to the battery or charging system, the fix is straightforward. We need to start by charging the battery or replacing it. Then, we need to make sure it remains charged or contact a professional for more help. Follow these steps if you plan to diagnose or fix the problem on your own.1. Charge the BatteriesIf the battery isn?t charged, you need to increase the voltage. When it?s completely dead, you may need to jumpstart the battery. After that, the message might appear until the battery has a full charge. The best way to charge a car battery is to drive at highway speeds. Plan to drive at least twenty minutes a week on the highway to keep the battery charged. Additionally, you can use a battery maintainer or trickle charger at home to keep it topped off. These are great options if you aren?t planning to drive the car for a while. We recommend reading through your vehicle?s service manual before working with the batteries. It?s important to know how many batteries your vehicle has, where they are located and the proper techniques used to charge them. 2. Replace BatteriesBattery ReplacementIf charging the battery doesn?t fix the problem or it keeps happening, you may need to replace it. Most auto parts stores will check the battery charge to see if it?s dead or you can test it with a multimeter. As we talked about earlier, Mercedes Benz usually has two batteries ? the main and the auxiliary battery. If any of these batteries fail, your vehicle can run on the good battery, but you will see this warning message on your dashboard. Therefore it?s important to check the health of both batteries.Here is how you can test and replace the Mercedes auxiliary battery.3. Maintain/Charge the Batteries Often As we?ve touched on before, it?s important to keep the batteries at a full charge. By driving, you won?t have trouble doing this, but you may need to get creative if you don?t do a lot of driving. Here are some tips to keep your batteries at optimal levels.Keep the terminals free from corrosion. Use a baking soda/water solution and wire brush to clean off any corrosion as it occurs. Drive your car at least twenty minutes a week at highway speeds.Hook up a maintainer or trickle charger when you can?t take the car out for a longer drive. Physically inspect the battery often. If you notice any bulges or imperfections, replace the battery.It isn?t difficult to keep the car battery in good condition. In fact, it only takes a few minutes of your time. On the other hand, if you kill the battery, you could get stranded in an inconvenient location, waiting for roadside assistance to jump your car. 4. Contact A ProfessionalIf you have a good amount of mechanical expertise, working with the car battery will probably feel like second nature. After all, it?s one of the first components we learned to deal with when we started working on cars.Still, it?s okay to reach out for help when you need it. If you can?t figure out why the battery keeps draining, there could be something running that shouldn?t. Parasitic drains can be difficult to hunt down and may require the help of a professional.

A complete diagnosis will help you hunt down the problem and get back on the road again without warning messages."
What Does Engine Power Reduced Mean on a Chevy Malibu?	"On the message screen, a warning saying ?Engine Power Reduced? means that the power flow has been scaled back to the Chevy Malibu. According to proposed class action lawsuits, this reduced power problem has been a common defect among Malibu models.When the power is reduced and the warning message appears, the Check Engine Light may also come on. This further reveals that there?s a mechanical problem that requires attention. As with most warning lights, it?s best to have it looked at right away. You don?t want to continue driving with minimal power and it?s important to prevent further damage from occurring."
what are the Causes Of Engine Power Reduced Chevy Malibu ?	"According to recent reports, the Engine Power Reduced problem seems to mainly affect the 2018 through 2022 Chevy Malibu models. Along with the reduced engine power, there is often one or more trouble codes present in the computer. Most of the Malibu cars affected have a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that is rated for 160 horsepower. Here are a few of the most common problems.1. Bad Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor (Most Common)Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor LocationThere?s a sensor located on the accelerator pedal that monitors its position. It?s a tiny sensor, but it can cause a lot of trouble when it malfunctions. If the sensor isn?t working correctly, engine power may be reduced.With older Malibu models, the accelerator pedal was attached with a cable. Now, the sensor is put in its place to create a lack of mechanical connection. The electrical setup is all monitored by a sensor and the information gets sent to the computer. The computer dictates how much power the throttle body needs to supply.However, if the sensor isn?t working, the computer won?t have the right information. Therefore, the wrong amount of power is sent, creating a long list of issues, including this warning message. 2. Defective Electronic Throttle Control SystemThere could also be other defects in the electronic throttle control system. While we?ve already discussed the problem with the accelerator position sensor, it could be another sensor on the throttle body itself. Without information being able to pass freely between the sensors, the computer doesn?t know what to do. Therefore, power is reduced until the issue can be resolved. 3. Faulty Engine SensorAll of the sensors in the electronic throttle control system must communicate for the system to work as designed. The pedal sensor sends information to the throttle body sensor, all of which need to be read by the engine.If this main sensor fails, the system won?t know how to respond. Again, the Engine Power Reduced message is going to illuminate, along with possibly the Check Engine Light.4. Bad WiringsBecause the modern throttle control system is electronic, there are plenty of wires and connectors in between the sensors. If any one of these connections fails, the message could also appear.While this problem isn?t as prevalent, it?s still possible. Considering how many wires and connectors there are to investigate, this can also be a lengthy problem to resolve. "
How To Fix The Engine Power Reduced Message On A Chevy Malibu?	"Once the message appears on the dashboard, you want to take immediate action to prevent any further damage. Because this is a known issue with the newer Malibu models, the steps outlined below are recommended by Chevy technicians.1. Check The WarrantyChevrolet MalibuBefore you do anything else, see if your factory warranty is still valid. Most newer Chevys are covered by a 3-year/36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty.If your vehicle is still covered, it?s best to take your Malibu directly to the dealership. The problem can be resolved by the technicians without spending a dime. The downside to this solution is that you may wait a little longer to get your car looked at under warranty. However, if you choose to have it fixed on your own, you might be liable for future issues. Some people also choose to buy extended warranty coverage on the vehicle. Depending on what company you use, this problem may or may not be covered. It?s best to reach out directly to the provider to figure out how to proceed. 2. Read Trouble CodesObd ScannerIf the Malibu is no longer under warranty, it?s time to take matters into your own hands. With a compatible code scanner, you can find out what?s causing the lights to come on. Plug the scanner into the OBD-II port, located underneath the steering wheel, near the driver?s side door.Reference the information with our online trouble code library to determine the culprit. If there are multiple codes showing, it might be best to reset them. Once the computer is reset, you can drive a little until the light comes back on. The only codes present at this time should be the most relative to the problem. 3. Clean Throttle BodyThe throttle body could be causing the issues if there?s dirt or contamination. Inspect the throttle body to see if it needs to be cleaned. When the throttle body is working and unobstructed, it opens and closes without a lot of effort. It should also close automatically when released.To clean the throttle body, follow these steps.Disconnect the throttle body from the air duct. As you take off the vacuum lines and electrical connectors, mark them, so they are easier to reconnect. Rotate the throttle plate. Spray throttle body cleaner inside.Dry it by using compressed air on the throttle body. Do not put the throttle body back until it?s dry.Reinstall all of the connectors and vacuum lines in the opposite order.If this doesn?t fix the problem, you may need to continue with the diagnostic steps.3. Check FluidsWhile it?s unlikely that low fluids are causing your problem, this step is usually recommended by technicians just in case. Check the oil level to ensure the engine has the lubrication it requires. If more fluid is needed, go ahead and add it now. Additionally, if the fluids look contaminated or dirty, you want to perform a change at this time. The dirty fluid doesn?t provide the lubrication that the vehicle needs. 4. Contact A ProfessionalThere are multiple reasons why it might be best to visit an auto repair shop. For starters, if you can?t figure out the problem or you don?t have the tools to diagnose it, a mechanic is your best bet. In just an hour, most problems can be identified. Plus, they will provide you with a detailed estimate to fix the fault.If you have been able to diagnose it but don?t feel equipped to fix the problem, you should also visit a local mechanic. Just be careful where you go because not all repair shops are reputable. Do your research first to determine who can be trusted. "

What Does A Triangle With Exclamation Point Symbol Mean?	"The triangle with an exclamation point warning light has different meanings with varying automakers. It could indicate a Critical Warning Message is available, telling you to look for other warnings. With Honda models, it also means there?s a problem with the vehicle stability assist (VSA) system. The exclamation point doesn?t normally mean that a major fault has occurred. In many cases, it?s just meant to draw your attention to another warning. Between the exclamation point and other warnings, you can usually put the pieces together to determine what?s wrong. The triangle with the exclamation point can be either red or yellow, depending on what brand it is. The color of the warning has nothing to do with the severity of the problem. In most cases, this light also comes on solid. It?s not normally known to flash, as some other warning lights can. "
what are the Causes Of A Triangle With Exclamation Mark ?	"The triangle warning light can be a catch-all alert or can show you problems with a specific system, depending on what type of car you drive. To understand what it means for your vehicle, you should check the owner?s manual. In some cases, it has to do with the traction control, stability control, VSA or brake system. Here are a few possibilities.1. Traction Control/Stability Control IssuesCar Dashboard Warning LightWith some vehicles, the exclamation point can indicate a problem with the traction control or stability control systems. You may also see a warning light that shows a car with squiggly road lines beneath it. It resembles a car driving on slippery road surfaces.In some cases, these lights simply show that the traction control system has been turned off. In other situations, it shows that there?s a malfunction that needs to be repaired. It?s important to note that the traction control and stability control lights can illuminate for a minute under normal conditions. If the light comes on and goes off, it probably means that traction was lost for a short time and regained. This happens when driving on slippery road conditions and it?s no cause for alarm. In fact, this flashing indicates that the system is working just as it was designed. 2. VSA System Issues (Honda)Vsa Light HondaHonda vehicles have Vehicle Stability Assist that can malfunction. When it does, you may see the exclamation point and another warning light that simply says, ?VSA.?Again, these lights could indicate that the system is turned off. Other times, there?s a problem that needs to be resolved. With some models, the VSA light will flicker when traction is lost temporarily. It?s only when the light is on solid that you need to troubleshoot the problem. Should VSA Be On or Off?If you drive a car with Vehicle Stability Assist, you may wonder whether it should be on or off. After all, the manufacturer has provided a button to turn the system off. When should this be used?In most conditions, you should never turn off the Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) system. It?s meant to be enabled in most driving conditions. The only time that it could benefit you to turn it off could be if the vehicle is stuck in the snow. If you can?t get the wheels to move in snowy situations, temporarily turn it off and see if that helps.When it?s turned off, the VSA light and the exclamation point will illuminate. These warnings should go away once you turn the system back on. 3. Brake System IssuesIf the exclamation point comes on along with a brake warning, the car could have low fluid. Without the right amount of brake fluid, it becomes harder to stop the vehicle quickly.In rare cases, it could indicate that the brake pads are worn or there?s another fault with the system. A quick look in the service manual should help indicate what the combination of warning lights means for your vehicle. 4. Information System Message AlertWith the majority of vehicles, the exclamation point is used to warn of other problems. It?s designed to get your attention, either to the dashboard where other lights are or the infotainment system for an important message.One would think that the warning lights or message alone would be enough to indicate a problem. However, automakers felt that a second warning was needed to get drivers? attention. "
How To Fix An Triangle With Exclamation Point Symbol ?	"It?s not too difficult to figure out what?s going on with the exclamation point symbol. In many cases, mechanical experience isn?t even required. Here are some steps to consider. 1.

What Does The Lightning Bolt Symbol Mean?	"The lightning bolt is known as the Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) Indicator. This symbol shows a lightning bolt that?s located between parenthesis or reversed brackets. When it comes on, it indicates a problem with the electronic throttle control system.The electronic throttle control system contains the accelerator pedal, the throttle body and an ETC module. The module reads input from the accelerator pedal and transmits data to the throttle body. For example, if you step on the accelerator, the ETC opens the throttle body in relation to the force applied to the pedal. When the pedal is released, the ETC closes the throttle body."
Differneces between Yellow and Red Lightning Bolt Symbol ?	"Some vehicles have a yellow lightning bolt symbol, while others show a red warning light. What is the difference? Is one more severe than another?One might think that a yellow or amber-colored lightning bolt symbol indicates a less severe problem versus the red warning, but that?s not the case. The reality is that these two symbols mean the same thing. The only difference is that some manufacturers choose to use yellow, while others installed a red light. "
what are the Causes of a Lightning Symbol On Car?	"When the lightning bolt illuminates on the dashboard, you know there?s a problem with something in the electronic throttle control system. It could be the throttle body, an accelerator pedal position sensor, the throttle position sensor or an issue with the wiring.1. Faulty or Dirty Throttle BodyDirty Throttle BodyWhen the throttle body gets dirty, it can become stuck. Additionally, if it is damaged, the system reports an ETC fault and the lightning bolt warning comes on.One of the main reasons for throttle body failure is contamination. As dirt and debris accumulate in the throttle body, the valve no longer functions as it should, leading to a problem with the air supply control. 2. Bad Accelerator Pedal Position SensorAccelerator Pedal Position Sensor LocationThere?s also an accelerator pedal position sensor working alongside the accelerator pedal module. This pedal position sensor relays the position of the pedal to the control module.The pedal module uses this information to alert the throttle position sensor so the position of the throttle remains correct. If the sensor doesn?t send the right information, the ETC system can?t work as intended. 3. Bad Throttle Position SensorThrottle Position SensorAlong with the pedal sensor, there?s also a sensor for the throttle position. The purpose of this sensor is to relay the throttle body?s current position to the computer. With this information, the computer adjusts the timing and fuel ratios for maximum performance. If the ECU can?t figure out how to time everything, the lightning bolt symbol comes on the dashboard. 4. Faulty WiringsThe electronic throttle control system contains numerous parts attached together by connectors and wires. If any one of these connections fails, the lightning bolt symbol could show up on the dashboard.Over time, wires can fray and become worn. The trouble with this problem is determining where the faulty wire is, as there are many to inspect. "
How To Fix A Lightning Symbol On Car Dashboard? 	"Working with the throttle control system isn?t always easy. If you aren?t mechanically inclined, you may have trouble with some of these steps. Otherwise, there?s no expensive or elaborate equipment needed to perform most of the procedures. 1. Read Trouble CodesDiagnose CarWith your professional code scanner, it?s easy to tell what faults are set in the computer. Plug the scanner into the OBD-II port to get the computer codes. These codes often reveal a letter and number combination, some of which are generic, while others are manufacturer specific. If you aren?t sure what the faults mean, you can look them up in our trouble code library. If the code scanner reveals too many faults, it?s best to reset the system and try again. You may need to drive the car for a short time until the light comes back on. Now, the codes that are present are just the newest ones, making it easier to diagnose what?s going on. 2. Clean Throttle BodyClean Throttle BodyPerform a visual inspection of the throttle body to see if contamination is causing the problem. If the throttle body is unobstructed, it will open and close with minimal effort. As soon as it is released, it should close automatically.If this isn?t what you notice, a simple cleaning might be required. Purchase a throttle body cleaner and follow these steps.Disconnect the air duct from the throttle body. When you remove vacuum lines or electrical connectors, mark them accordingly for reconnection. Rotate the throttle plates. Spray your cleaner on the inside of the throttle body. Spray compressed air onto the throttle body to dry all of the solvent. Don?t reinstall the connections until the throttle body is completely dry.Reinstall the vacuum lines and connectors.Once these steps are complete, take the vehicle for a test drive to see if the problem is resolved. If not, you may need to move on to the next steps.3. Calibrate Throttle BodyDepending on what type of car you drive, there are varying procedures for resetting the throttle body. These procedures must often be performed after you replace the throttle body or clean it. Reference the service manual to see what?s needed for your vehicle, or follow these steps.Start the engine.Allow the vehicle to idle for three minutes.Shut the engine off and wait a minute.Restart the engine and allow it to run for three minutes. This may be enough to reset it with most cars. However, some models require you to drive for a short time. If this step is needed, drive at highway speeds for a few minutes. During that time, you want to accelerate and decelerate repeatedly. Additionally, you may be able to reset the throttle body with an advanced scan tool. You may be able to perform a relearn procedure on the throttle body, so it resets. 4. Inspect WiringIf none of the previous fixes repaired the situation, you need to inspect the wiring and connectors. This process can take some time as you track every connection from the start to finish.If you notice any frayed or damaged wiring, you want to replace it. Additionally, bad connections should be repaired, so the system can properly communicate through the sensors. 5. Contact A ProfessionalIf you?ve worked through all of the other steps and can?t seem to figure out what?s going on, it?s best to visit a repair shop at this time. With more sophisticated diagnostic equipment and skilled technicians on-site, you may get a better answer than what you?ve found. You may have been able to figure out what?s wrong but don?t feel experienced enough to fix it. This is another appropriate time to visit a repair shop in your area. "
Can I drive with the lightning bolt symbol on?	"You could still drive, but we don?t advise it. While the car may still run, the idle and acceleration can be affected. This not only poses a safety issue on the road but can also lead to engine damage if it?s not repaired promptly. "
How much does it cost to fix a lightning bolt symbol?	"It depends on what?s causing the problem. If you only need to clean the throttle body, your supplies shouldn?t cost more than $25. However, if a sensor or wiring needs to be replaced, the cost could easily add up to several hundred dollars. "
Can I drive with throttle body problems?	"The car will usually still run, but not well. You will notice performance issues that can lead to a rough idle or unexpected acceleration. For this reason, it?s not advisable to drive when there?s a problem with the throttle body or one of the sensors."
How do you calibrate the throttle body?	"Depending on the vehicle model, you may be able to recalibrate it with an advanced scan tool. Otherwise, starting the engine and letting it idle often does the trick. You may also need to run the car at highway speeds for a short time. Check the service manual for more information. "
Conclusion	"As with any warning light, it?s important to pay attention when the lightning bolt symbol appears on the dashboard of your car. It?s trying to tell you that there?s a problem with the electronic throttle control system. If left unchecked, you could face serious on-road performance issues that put you in jeopardy. It can also lead to engine damage, causing even higher repair bills.If you want your vehicle to continue working for you, it?s important to take prompt action whenever there?s a problem. At the first sign of the lightning bolt symbol, inspect the throttle body system and repair what is broken. Your vehicle will thank you for it."
What Does The ESC Light Mean?	"The ESC Light indicates that there is a problem with your car?s electric stability control system. This system works hand in hand with your vehicle?s traction control system to help you control your vehicle in dangerous conditions.But while stability control and traction control are often referred to together, they are not the same system. Stability offers additional features than traction control, including those that can help you in an understeer or oversteer situation.So, while an electronic stability control system will always incorporate traction control, not every vehicle with traction control has stability control."
what is the Electric Stability Control (ESC) Light Function ?	"The ESC light is there to alert you when there is a problem in the electronic stability control circuit, or to tell you that your stability control system is currently in use. When this happens, it either means that there?s a problem somewhere in the system, or everything is working as it should, and it?s keeping you from skidding across the road.If it is working as it should, you?re going to notice. You?ll feel your vehicle applying the brakes to individual wheels, and the light is going to flash on and off, but it won?t stay on. If there?s a problem in the system, the light will stay on, and you?re not likely to notice anything ? although it?s possible the system could kick on at any point depending on the fault.Some type of electronic stability control is required for all modern vehicles, however the type of ESC system the car uses depends on the car manufacturer."
what are the Causes ESC Light ?	"The most common cause of an ESC light is either that the system is turned off by mistake or a faulty wheel speed sensor. It can also be caused by a bad steering angle sensor or a wiring issue.But while those are the most common causes of an ESC light, they?re not the only things you need to look out for. Below, we have highlighted the four most common reasons why your vehicle?s ESC light may be on.1. System Is Turned OffTraction Control OffDid you know that in most vehicles, you can turn the stability control system off? While you don?t want to do this unless you?re trying to drift, it is something you can do. And when you turn the ESC system off, the ESC light turns on.Before you take your vehicle to the repair shop, look up how to turn the system on and off and give it a try. You?d be surprised how many times this fixes the problem and prevents unnecessary headaches.2. Faulty Wheel Speed SensorsAbs SensorIf there is a problem within the system, it almost always comes down to a faulty wheel speed sensor. Your vehicle?s ESC system works by monitoring each wheel speed sensor, and then adjusting the brakes to fit any discrepancies that it notices.But if one of the wheel speed sensors is completely offline or giving errant readings, then your ESC system will have problems. Verify that each wheel speed sensor is working correctly by hooking up a scan tool and monitoring each sensor?s speed readings while driving.3. Faulty Steering Angle SensorSteering Angle SensorAnother sensor that controls your ESC system is the steering angle sensor. This sensor works in tandem with the wheel speed sensors to ensure that each wheel is spinning at an appropriate speed according to the direction you?re going.That?s because as you turn, the outside wheels are going to spin faster than the inside wheels. This is completely normal, but without the steering angle sensor telling the ECM what?s happening, it?s going to look like one side of your wheels is slipping while the other side has perfect traction.4. Faulty Wiring/Electrical ProblemsThe sensors themselves might be working perfectly fine, but if there?s a break in the wiring between the sensor and the ECM, nothing is going to work correctly. While this is a little more on the rare side, it can happen, especially near the wheel speed sensors where the wiring is exposed.Finally, always verify the power and the battery when checking these sensors. I once spent half a day troubleshooting an ESC system that errantly kicked on at high speeds only to discover the problem was a battery with a dead cell.The vehicle still started, but it kicked up issues in the ESC system. To this day, I still don?t know how or why it happened ? but double-check the battery."
Is It Safe To Drive With an ESC Light?	"It is not safe to drive with an ESC light on. But just because your ESC light turns on while you?re driving doesn?t necessarily mean that you have a problem. If the light kicked on and off while driving on slippery roads or while you were skidding, then everything was working the way it should, and you don?t need to worry about a thing.However, if your ESC light is turning on when it shouldn?t or is staying on all the time (when you haven?t turned the system off), this is not a safe condition to be driving in.That?s because your ESC system regains stability by turning on your ABS and applying the brakes to individual tires ? which means while you?re driving down the road, your brakes can start pumping on and off ? even if you?re heading 80 miles per hour down the highway.So, while you likely won?t run into any problem while driving if you have an ESC light on, the first time it acts up could wind up causing a serious accident."
Conclusion	"If the ESC light is showing on your dashboard, it usually indicates that there is an issue with your car?s electronic stability control system. It is usually showing up together with a traction control light or an ABS light.While there are plenty of things to love about modern technology, it can be tempting to curse at it when things start acting up. But don?t write off the ESC system completely. While it can be a little frustrating when things aren?t working the way they should, it?s a potentially life-saving innovation when you need it most.The few problems they occasionally cause are well worth it, considering the thousands of accidents they?ve prevented."
What Does The Service Engine Soon Light Mean?	"The Service Engine Soon light indicates that it?s time for regular maintenance or repair. It?s used to alert you to a problem without causing serious alarm. Whatever has gone wrong is likely not severe, but it still requires your attention.This warning light doesn?t have a picture attached to it. Instead, the words ?SERVICE ENGINE SOON? appear on the dashboard. The letters are lit up with an amber-colored light. "
differences between Service Engine Soon and Check Engine Light ?	"The differences between the two lights are how they look and the type of problem that occurs. When the Service Engine Soon light comes on, you know it?s time for regular maintenance or there?s a minor mechanical problem that requires your attention. The Service Engine Soon light is written out in words.On the other hand, the Check Engine Light includes a picture that resembles a motor. With some models, you see the words ?Check Engine? The problems associated with this warning include varying degrees of severity. With a solid Check Engine Light, there could be a mechanical problem that requires attention as soon as possible. This light also comes on for some minor problems that aren?t a big deal. When the Check Engine Light is blinking, it means catastrophic damage can occur if you keep driving, requiring you to pull over and turn the car off. You should never ignore the blinking light."
what are the Causes Of Service Engine Soon Light ?	"When the Service Engine Soon Light comes on, you know that it?s either time for regular maintenance or a fault needs to be corrected. Here are some of the most common causes of a service engine soon light:1. Loose Or Faulty Gas CapCar Gas CapIf you?ve just filled up the tank, you may not have put the gas cap back in place. When the gas cap is loose, it sends a signal to the ECU, mimicking a leak in the system. This would be the simplest problem to rectify.The same problem occurs if the gas cap gets cracked or broken. Additionally, if you leave the gas cap behind, the open system will cause a warning light on the dashboard. While there may not be any performance issues from driving without a gas cap, you want to have it fixed as soon as you can.2. Low Fluid LevelCar MaintenanceRegular maintenance includes changing the fluid and flushing systems. Oil changes should occur every 3,000 to 10,000 miles, depending on what type of oil you use. At the same time, the oil filter should be changed. Additionally, the coolant and transmission fluid should also have regular changes.If one of these services is due or overdue, the warning light might appear on the dashboard. It?s not because the system knows when a fluid change is needed, but more likely because the old, contaminated fluid is leading to other problems. Reference the maintenance schedule to determine what is supposed to be done. 3. Scheduled Service OverdueService OverdueThe fluid changes aren?t the only maintenance tasks that should be performed. The manufacturer also outlines when air filters should be changed, spark plugs should be replaced, and brake pads should be checked.Your Service Engine Soon light might come on as a reminder that service has been neglected. Again, it?s not because the system has an idea of when service should be performed, but it does recognize when problems are created as a result of neglect. For example, if you don?t change the spark plugs and one becomes fouled, the system is going to tell you that an issue is happening. 4. Contaminated GasThere?s no way of knowing if the gas at your local filling station is any good. For this reason, it?s possible that you put bad gas in your car. While it?s less possible when visiting a top-tier fuel station, it can still happen. Otherwise, you may have let the gas sit in the tank too long, where it can also go bad.When the car has bad gas in it, the Service Engine Soon light can come on. You may also have trouble starting the engine or notice a rough idle. In extreme cases, there will be pinging sounds and the engine will stall. 5. Faulty Engine SensorWith the engine, there are multiple sensors designed to keep everything running efficiently. From the oxygen sensors to the mass airflow sensor, the ECU is constantly analyzing data and making adjustments. If one of these sensors fails, it?s possible that the Service Engine Soon light may come on.Additionally, some cars have a Check Engine Light instead for these problems. For that reason, either light is possible with a defective sensor. "
How To Fix A Service Engine Soon Light ?	"Once the Service Engine Light comes on, you want to make time to fix the problem as soon as possible. By neglecting the light, you could allow larger problems to manifest, thereby causing higher repair bills in the future.With a few minutes, you can figure out what?s going on with your car. Here are some of our suggestions.1. Check Gas CapIf you?ve pulled away from the fuel station when the Service Engine Soon comes on, you should start by checking the gas cap. Pull over wherever it is safe and pop the gas cover. If the cap isn?t on tightly enough, secure it better and see if the light turns off.If the cap is on tightly, but you notice cracks or imperfections, you will need to get a new cap. The same is true if the cap is missing. Thankfully, you shouldn?t need to spend more than around $10 to get a cap at an auto parts store. 2. Check And Top Up Fluid LevelsTop Up Fluids CarThe next step would be to take a look at all of the fluid levels. Start with the oil. Pull the dipstick and wipe it off with a clean rag. Pull it back out again to read the levels. If it?s low, add some oil. If the oil appears to be contaminated, you should perform a complete change with a new filter.After checking the oil, move on to the other fluids. You should examine the level and condition of both the coolant and transmission fluid. If either of these appears to be low, add some compatible fluid to the reservoir. 3. Read Trouble CodesWhenever a fault is set in the ECU, codes are available to show you what?s wrong. With a compatible code scanner, you can read the DTCs to determine what?s going on. Plug your OBD-II scanner into the port located under the steering wheel.Once you get the code, you can use our library to figure out what?s going on. We have a complete trouble code resource guide that shows you the meaning of the most common codes and outlines some possible fixes. 4. Check Service HistoryHopefully, you are tracking the service you?ve performed on your car and when. With this information, you should be able to easily tell what?s due based on the odometer reading now.Perform everything that the manufacturer recommends for the specified interval that you are at. While these services may not turn off the light, it?s important to keep up with the schedule to keep the vehicle in good running condition. 5. Contact A ProfessionalNot everyone should attempt to fix the Service Engine Soon light on their own. If you don?t have a lot of expertise or you lack the equipment needed for diagnostics, it may be best to visit an auto repair shop instead.Shop around the local professionals in your area. Ask what their experience is and evaluate the labor rates. You don?t need to visit the dealership and pay the higher prices unless you prefer to do business with these shops. "
Can I drive with the service engine soon light on?	"When any warning light comes on the dashboard, you should take it seriously. While the Service Engine Soon light isn?t normally anything major, you still want to deal with it as soon as possible. Any neglect could lead to bigger repair problems that could also mean higher costs. "
Is the service engine soon light serious?	"Most of the time, the Service Engine Soon light isn?t anything severe. The only way to know for sure is with your compatible code scanner. You don?t want to ignore the warning or parts could break, causing you even more trouble and higher repair bills. "
Can service engine soon light turn off on its own?	"The only way to get the light off for good is to repair the problem causing the code. Once the fault is repaired, you can clear the code with your scanner. It should remain off. If it doesn?t, you need to re-read the codes to see what?s wrong with the system."
Can an oil change cause a service engine soon light?	"Your car needing an oil change isn?t enough to turn on the Service Engine Soon light. However, the problems that come from neglecting an oil change can make the light come on. If the oil filter is clogged and the pressure is low, the light may alert you to the issue, giving you time to resolve it. "
Conclusion	"It?s always alarming to see a warning light on the dashboard. The good news is that you don?t normally need to panic over the Service Engine Soon light. While you should take care of the problem as soon as you can, there?s no reason to pull over on the side of the road. Instead, drive carefully back to your home and start diagnosing the problem for a quick repair.If you choose to neglect the Service Engine Soon light, you can expect bigger problems to arise. A minor problem can lead to failure in other areas, with parts that could be expensive. An example of this is when you drive with bad spark plugs. This simple $100 fix could easily turn into $2,000 if the fouled plugs damage the catalytic converter. Take care of your car and it will provide you with more years of service. "
What Does The Engine Management Light Mean?	"The Engine Management Light is also known as the Check Engine Light, and this light illustrates the shape of an engine to tell you there?s a problem. The light can come on for a mild issue, such as a loose gas cap, but also tells you when something major is wrong, such as engine damage.When the amber-colored light illuminates, it normally means that there?s a malfunction somewhere that may not be an emergency. While it should be checked right away, it?s probably nothing that?s going to cause immediate engine damage. Left unchecked, it could lead to further damage. For example, you may be able to drive with a faulty oxygen sensor, but it will eventually cause the catalytic converter to fail, which is an expensive repair bill. On the other hand, if the engine light blinks, there?s a more serious problem at hand. You should stop driving immediately to find out what?s wrong. Some vehicles also have a red-colored engine light that only comes on when there?s an emergency. Check your owner?s manual to find out what the various Engine Management Lights mean for your vehicle. "
what are the Causes Of An Engine Management Light ?	"If the Engine Management Light comes on, you may be looking at multiple issues. The only way to know what?s wrong for sure is to complete diagnostics. While there are hundreds of possible explanations for the engine light to come on, these are some of the top causes.1. Faulty Engine SensorCar Engine SensorsThe engine is comprised of multiple sensors that tell the computers how much fuel and air is necessary for proper combustion. If a sensor has failed or is giving bad readings, the Engine Management Light may come on. In some cases, the sensor itself is bad, while other times, there?s a legitimate imbalance and the sensor is doing its job. The oxygen sensor is a common culprit of this malfunction. These O2 sensors read how much unburnt oxygen is passing through the exhaust, so adjustments can be made. There?s also a mass airflow sensor that measures the amount of oxygen moving into the engine. If either is faulty, the engine could run rough and you will notice a reduction in fuel economy. 2. Misfiring EngineMisfiresIf one of the cylinders doesn?t fire when it?s supposed to, a misfire occurs. This problem will typically cause the Engine Management Light to flash, signifying that there?s a major problem. You don?t want to continue running your vehicle with a misfiring engine.In some cases, the problem stems from a fouled spark plug or a bad ignition coil. However, you don?t want to overlook the possibility that there?s something damaged with the cylinder as well. 3. Fuel Supply IssuesWe?ve already discussed how the engine needs both air and fuel to operate, so if there?s something keeping fuel from entering, the Engine Management Light could come on. Blocked fuel injectors are a common cause for this warning light.Fuel injectors deliver fuel to the engine. Typically, there?s a fuel injector for every cylinder and they are timed by the ECU. If a clog occurs, one cylinder won?t get the fuel needed, which could lead to a misfire. A blocked or failing fuel pump can also create problems. The pump delivers the fuel to the engine through the injectors. However, if the pump fails, delivery can?t occur. 4. Loose Gas CapIt?s hard to believe that something as small as the gas cap can cause such big problems, but it?s also a common complaint. If you just filled up the gas tank, the cap could be the reason that the light is on.If the cap isn?t secured, it will trigger the engine light. Additionally, if the cap has become cracked or it?s missing, you will have the same problems. 5. Engine DamageIf the Engine Management Light is blinking or red, the damage might have already occurred. This light tells you to pull over immediately and stop running the engine.Depending on what caused the engine damage, it might still be repairable, so you don?t want to take any chances. Have the car towed home or to the shop if you can?t check it where it sits."
How To Fix An Engine Management Light ?	"1. Top Up FluidsFill Motor OilBefore you do anything else, it helps to check the fluid levels. Running an engine without the right amount of oil is a surefire way to ruin it.Pull out the dipstick and wipe it off with a towel. Re-read the dipstick to se where the levels are at and fill it up if needed. You should also check the coolant and transmission fluid at the same time, just in case either of these is low. 2. Check Gas CapIf you?ve recently been to the gas station, you should double-check the cap. It?s possible that you didn?t put it on tight enough, causing the Engine Management Light to come on. If that?s the case, simply secure the cap and the light should turn off.If the cap is damaged or missing, you need to replace it. You can get a new gas cap at any auto parts store for around $10, making this an inexpensive repair. 3. Read Trouble CodesWith your compatible code scanner, you can read the faults set by the computer. Simply plug the OBD-II scanner into the port under the steering wheel to see what codes come up. If there are too many to discern at first, reset the codes and drive the car for a short time. If the light comes back on, you can re-read the codes to see what was set most recently.Figuring out what the codes mean can be the trickiest part of this step. Because you will get a number and letter combination, such as P0300, you won?t immediately know what?s wrong. Thankfully, you can use our trouble code database for in-depth guides on the most common faults. 4. Contact A ProfessionalIf you can?t determine what?s wrong or you are having difficulty understanding what the trouble code means, it might be better to visit with a local mechanic. After paying a diagnostic fee, you will have a better understanding of what?s wrong and how to fix it.From here, you can still choose to fix the problem yourself if you have the tools and the expertise. Otherwise, it might be better to trust the professionals, especially if engine damage is a factor. "
Can I Sell a Car With the Engine Management Light On?	"It?s possible to sell the car with dashboard warning lights on, but you will likely take a hit on the value. If you run the KBB value of your car, you won?t be able to choose the valuation of a vehicle in Good condition. Instead, you would have to choose Poor or Fair, which dramatically reduces the value. If you don?t know what?s wrong with it, you could lose even more money.For this reason, we recommend at least figuring out what?s wrong. If you know what needs to be fixed, you can tell the potential buyers so they have more peace of mind.Better yet, why not repair the problem before you sell the car? You want to take this route, especially if the repair is simple and inexpensive. Don?t leave someone else with the burden of fixing it unless you don?t care how much money you receive for it. Even if you plan to trade the car into a local dealership, you can expect them to take money off for the dashboard warning light. The technicians will check the codes and determine what needs to be fixed and then reduce the price of the car by at least that amount, if not more. Plus, the dealership is going to use its higher labor rates to justify giving you less money."
Is it OK to drive with the engine management light on?	"No, when the warning light comes on the dashboard, you should take it seriously. While it could be a minor issue, there are plenty of faults that are serious and should be dealt with immediately. Plus, while the light is on, you have no way of telling if something else has gone wrong, leaving you unprotected."
Is the engine management light serious?	"It can be. Most of the time, when the engine management light reflects an amber color and it stays on solid, there?s not an immediate threat. However, continuing to run the car without being fixed can lead to bigger and more expensive problems. If the engine management light is blinking or is red, you should stop driving and figure out what?s wrong right away. "
Is an amber engine management light serious?	"The amber-colored engine light that?s solid is typically not immediately serious, but you should never ignore it. Even if the problem is minor, it could lead to more damage if neglected. You would need to pay attention to a blinking amber light, as this shows a major fault is occurring. "
What does a flashing engine management light mean?	"When this warning light starts to flash or if it is a solid red color, you must take immediate action. This type of warning indicates that engine damage might already be occurring and there?s no time to wait. Pull over as soon as it is safe and diagnose the vehicle. If you can?t work on it where it is, call for a tow truck to haul it home or deliver it to the nearest repair shop. "
Conclusion	"The Engine Management Light should bring some concern and it should force you to take action. With that said, there are plenty of reasons that the Check Engine Light comes on for minor problems and easy-to-fix complications. With the help of a code scanner, you can tell what?s wrong, so you can keep your vehicle in good working condition.On the other hand, there?s always the chance that the Engine Management Light is on because of a major problem. For that reason, you should always diagnose the problem right away."
What Does A Tire Pressure Light Mean?	"The tire pressure light indicates either that there is low tire pressure in one or more of the tires, or that there is a malfunction in the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS).The tire pressure monitoring system measures how much air pressure is in the tires of a vehicle. The TPMS system reports the data to the computer, and a light comes on the dashboard if the values are outside the normal parameters.This technology first arrived in Europe with luxury models in the 1980s. It wasn?t until the 2000 TREAD Act in the United States that it was adopted across the board. This vital act was created to counterbalance the controversy of Firestone tires and Ford vehicles in the 1990s. During that time, hundreds of deaths occurred because of defective tires. "
what are the Causes of A Tire Pressure Light ?	"When the tire pressure light comes on, you can pretty much bet that one of the tires is low or that there?s a problem with the TPMS equipment. Most people prefer to start by checking tire pressures, but here are all the possible causes you could be facing:1. Low Tire PressureLow Tire PressureThe most common cause of the tire pressure light is low tire pressure. Considering this is the purpose of the light, it?s safe to assume that one of the tires needs air. In some vehicles, the infotainment system will also tell you which tire is low on air, making it easier to repair. If it doesn?t, you can use your tire pressure gauge to match up the measurements with what?s on the driver?s side door panel. 2. Faulty Tire Pressure SensorTire Pressure SensorThe tire pressure sensors are located on the tires and are prone to damage. In general, these sensors should last five to ten years as long as they don?t become too contaminated with dirt and debris. Another issue that leads to sensor malfunction is putting other items into the tire. For example, both flat repair sealants and nitrogen fill-ups have been linked to sensor failure. 3. Tire Pressure Sensor Lost MemoryIf a battery fails in the tire pressure sensor, you can get a false reading. There are other reasons for the lost memory too.For example, if you are swapping out the car battery, memory can be lost to numerous accessories. One of these could be the tire pressure sensor system, depending on how your vehicle is configured. 4. Changed Wheels Without ResetCar Wheel ChangeIf you need to get new wheels due to an accident, or you want to upgrade, you could end up with problems on the TPMS. When wheels are changed out, it?s necessary to reset the tire pressure sensors.Most reputable tire shops know this process and will take care of it for you. However, if they were in a hurry, they might have overlooked it. The same is true when the tires are replaced. 5. Tire Pressure Sensor Not ResetWhen sensors are installed or the tires are worked on, the sensor needs to be reset. This problem happens most often after a tire rotation when the tires need to relearn the process.Some tires require a TPMS tool to reset the calibration. Otherwise, you may simply be able to drive for a few minutes to have the tires relearn what?s needed. 6. Bad Car BatteryBecause the TPMS runs on electrical power, the battery is necessary for proper operation. If the battery is going bad, you might have problems with the TPMS, along with other accessories and systems.Additionally, a bad alternator could be to blame if you can?t keep the battery charged. A complete examination of the charging system would be in order. "
How To Fix A Tire Pressure Light ?	"The good news about working with a tire pressure light is that most problems aren?t complicated to fix. With some basic tools and beginner knowledge, it?s possible to get back on the road quickly. We recommend checking the service manual for more information. Otherwise, you can follow these general steps.1. Correct The Tire PressureInflate TireYour first step involves checking the tire pressures. If the system is telling you which tire is to blame, check this one first. Otherwise, go around to each of the tires with your gauge to see which one is low. Ideally, you should check the tire pressure when they are cold and before they have been driven on. Compare the pressure you see with the recommended amount by the manufacturer. This information can be found in the owner?s manual or on the driver?s side door panel. If the tires need more air, fill them up accordingly. The light should go off once the pressure is right. Otherwise, you need to move on to the other steps.2. Reset Tire Pressure LightTpms ButtonIf the tire pressure light doesn?t go off after refilling the tires, or the light needs to be reset, you can try a few different methods. With most cars, driving over 50 mph for ten minutes is enough to reset the tire pressure light. By the next time you turn on the vehicle, the light should be off.With some other models, you need to follow these steps.Turn the key ON. Do not start the vehicle.Hold down the TPMS reset button. This button is normally found under the steering wheel. After the warning light blinks three times, release the button.Start the vehicle and wait twenty seconds to see if the light resets.If these steps don?t work, inflate the tires to 3 PSI over what?s recommended. You should also include the spare tire. Deflate the tires completely and reinflate them to the desired amount. If nothing else has worked, you can disconnect the battery for a few minutes. This will remove power from the system, causing it to reset. However, it will also reset other functions, such as the stereo presets and seat memory settings. 3. Read Trouble CodesThere?s a chance that reading the trouble codes will help you determine what?s wrong. Use your OBD2 code scanner to see if any DTCs have to do with the tire pressure sensors.Not all code scanners will read this system. Therefore, you may need to visit a tire repair shop for additional information. 4. Replace & Reprogram Tire Pressure SensorsTpms Sensor ProgrammingIf you have had work on the tires or have recently installed new wheels, the problem may just be a reprogram. If you had the repairs done at the tire shop, take the vehicle back to them to have it reprogrammed.If not, you may need a reprogramming TPMS tool to get the technology reset. However, most automakers include a way to reset and relearn with new sensors. You can read more about the procedure in your service manual or do a quick search online with your car model. 5. Replace Car BatteryIf you?ve determined that the charging system is to blame, it might be time to replace your car battery. Check the voltage on your car battery with a multimeter to see if it is holding a charge. You can also take the battery to your local auto parts store for a free check. Many locations will also check the alternator.When you put a new battery in, you may also need to reset the tire pressure sensor light. After a little bit of driving, the light should turn itself off. 6. Contact A ProfessionalIf the previous procedures don?t help, or you can?t figure out what?s going on, it?s best to reach out to a professional. There?s no reason to bang your head against the wall when someone more experienced can easily figure out what the problem is.In most cases, it makes sense to go to a tire repair shop since they are experts in TPMS equipment. However, you may already have a good relationship with an auto repair shop in your area that you prefer to use. Either way, it shouldn?t cost more than an hour of labor to figure out what?s going on. "
Is it safe to drive with the tire pressure light on?	"You should check the tire pressure as soon as you can to verify that none of them are losing pressure. If air is needed, go ahead and put it in. Otherwise, equipment failure could lead to an illuminated light when the pressures are fine. In these situations, we recommend getting repair as soon as possible."
Why is my tire pressure light on when my tires are fine?	"One of the sensors might have gone bad or simply needs to be reset. Sensors have a limited life span, especially when subject to dirt and debris. On average, they may last five to ten years before replacement is necessary. Additionally, a dead battery could be the culprit."
How long can I go with the tire pressure light on?	"If a tire is losing air pressure, you may not have a lot of time. Driving on a flat tire can lead to serious damage and increases the chance of an accident. The only way to know for sure is to check the tire pressures and see if air is being lost. If not, you should have the fault repaired right away."
Will a low tire pressure light go off on its own?	"If the tire pressures are okay and everything in the system checks out, the light may simply need to be reset. You can typically reset the light by driving for an extended amount of time or by using the included reset button under the steering wheel. Read your owner?s manual to get more directions."
Can hot weather cause the tire pressure light to come on?	"Tire pressures can change based on the weather, which is why you should always check the pressure before driving. For every ten degrees, the temperature goes up, the air pressure can also rise by one PSI. That?s why we always recommend checking tire pressures whenever the weather changes dramatically. "
Conclusion	"When the tire pressure light comes on your dashboard, it might catch you by surprise, but it?s not normally something to worry about. Simply pull over as soon as you can and check the tire pressures. If one of the tires is low, go ahead and fill it up before driving any further.If the tire pressure isn?t causing the light to come on, there are bigger problems to look into. However, none of them are that severe and they are usually rectified with a simple solution. Make sure those tires are taken care of so you can remain safe on the road."
What Does Service Tire Monitor System Mean?	"The Service Tire Monitor System message indicates something is wrong with the tire pressure monitoring equipment. It?s usually a separate warning from the normal TPMS message. When this message alerts you, you will likely also see the low tire pressure light on the dashboard and the warning message on the infotainment system. If there?s just a malfunction due to low tire pressure, you may not see this message. For the most part, when the issue is tire pressure related, the alert on new cars will include information about which tire is low, so you can fill it up.Instead, this warning is trying to show you that the equipment for the TPMS isn?t working. You will often find the Service Tire Monitor System message in GM, Buick, and Chevy vehicles."
What Is A Tire Monitor System?	"The Tire Monitor System is the TPMS equipment. With this feature, the air pressure in all of the tires is being measured to ensure safety. When a tire gets too low, the alert goes off so you can fill it up with air. With most of the newer models, the TPMS light would come on and the infotainment system would tell you which tire is low. Because of the alert, drivers no longer have to rely on manually checking tire pressures regularly. The system is also advanced enough to tell you when something is wrong with the sensors or calibration. In these cases, the TPMS light might come on, but so will a warning telling you to service the tire monitor system. "
what are the Causes Of Service Tire Monitor System Message ?	"The Service Tire Monitor System message is usually caused by a faulty component within the TPMS system, such as a bad TPMS sensor, low battery, or faulty calibration or programming. However, it could potentially also be caused by low tire pressure.Here are a few things that could cause the Service Tire Monitor System message:1. Tire Pressure Sensor Lost MemoryTire Pressure SensorOn the tire pressure monitors, there?s a lithium-ion battery that keeps it powered up. These batteries tend to last for around five years under normal use. They can fail prematurely if they have been exposed to extreme weather or conditions. If the battery dies, the sensor stops communicating with the PCM. Because there?s no data being relayed, the service message pops up until you put in a new battery. 2. Faulty Tire Pressure SensorOn every tire, there?s a TPMS sensor with a radio signal attached. This tire sensor monitors air pressure and lets you know if it gets low. These sensors are subject to a lot of wear simply because of how close to the road they are.If the sensor gets contaminated with debris, dirt or too much water, it can fail. Sensors can also fail because of too much sealant around the stem valves. Additionally, corrosion has been known to take some out. With the sensor out of commission, the PCM can?t read the tire pressure. Therefore, an alert is sent out to tell you there?s a problem. 3. Changed Wheels Without ResetChange WheelsIf you swap out the wheels on your car, the new sensors must be calibrated. This service requires a special TPMS tool, making it difficult for many people to do at home without a workaround method.Without this calibration, you will get the Service Tire Monitor System message. During a reset, the sensors relearn the processes and connect with the computer. 4. Tire Pressure Sensor Not ResetThe sensors need to be recalibrated any time they are changed. This doesn?t just occur when you change out the wheels but also when a sensor must be replaced.If you swapped out the sensor but didn?t do the reset, the message is going to appear. You can use a TPMS tool to recalibrate it or several workaround tactics. 5. Low Tire PressureLow Tire PressureWheboard. In many cases, the system will also tell you which tire is low, so you can resolve the problem.While it?s rare to see the Service Tire Monitor System with a low tire, it?s not impossible. There could be a malfunction causing the service message to alert you instead of just the low tire information. Your tire pressures should be checked regularly anyway, so now seems like a good time. 6. Bad Car BatteryAll of the electronics are running through the power supplied by the car battery. If there?s a problem with the car battery, these high-tech sensors can fail to read. The PCM will think that something has happened with the sensor and send out an alert.The good news is that when the battery is to blame, there are normally other signs of a problem. After all, the battery dying normally causes issues with everything from starting the car to running the lights. "
How To Fix The Service Tire Monitor System Message ?	"To fix the Service Tire Monitor System message, you need to diagnose what?s causing this warning light with an OBD2 scanner. You also want to ensure that the tire pressure is correct and reset the TPMS system.In some cases, you will be able to repair the Service Tire Monitor System message in your home garage without any special tools. We outline a few possible solutions that can help you out. 1. Correct The Tire PressureInflate TireJust in case the warning is on because of low tire pressures, you should start here. You can verify the tire pressures with your home gauge. Match up the pressure you see with the data on the driver?s side door jamb. If you verified that the tire pressures are normal and the light remains on, you know this isn?t the problem. You will want to move on to the next steps. 2. Reset Tire Pressure LightTpms Sensor ProgrammingIf you believe that the sensors just need to be reset, you have multiple options. A reset is necessary any time that the sensors are replaced, new tires are installed or service has been performed. Look in the service manual to see the appropriate procedure for your vehicle.You can have the reset done with a TPMS tool. There are also some cars with a button for resetting or you may be able to drive for a short time until it resets. 3. Read Trouble CodesYou can try to read trouble codes with your OBD-II scanner. Not all scanners are going to read these codes, but you should have success if your diagnostic tool is advanced.You may have other lights on the dashboard as well that the code scanner will help you understand. With the free trouble code listing at MechanicBase, you can figure out what?s wrong with ease. 4. Reprogram Tire Pressure SensorsAfter the sensors are replaced, a reprogramming is required. The sensors need to learn the parameters used by the PCM. With a TPMS tool, you can recalibrate the sensors. If you don?t have this tool, most tire shops will handle the reprogram in a matter of minutes. 5. Replace The Car BatteryIf the issue seems to be related to power, you may be having trouble with the battery. Run a voltage check on the battery to see if it?s charged. If you don?t know how to do this, you can take the battery to most auto part stores for a free check. Once the battery starts to fail, it?s best to replace it. Additionally, corrosion on the battery terminals can disrupt the power supply. If you see corrosion, use a baking soda and water mixture to clean it off. Reconnect the battery and see if it works better. 6. Contact A ProfessionalThere aren?t too many more issues that could be occurring with the Service Tire Monitor System message. Most likely, you?ve figured out the problem by now. If you haven?t, there could be a deeper fault with the electrical system.Some issues can be troublesome to diagnose and repair. If it feels like the issue is over your head, go ahead and visit your local auto repair shop instead. After all, you don?t want to continue driving with this message on the dashboard. "

Most fixes are simple enough to perform at home, so there?s not a lot of cost involved. While this problem might not be as critical as some of the other messages that come on the dashboard, it should never be ignored."
What Does It Mean When The Tire Pressure Light Is Blinking?	"A blinking tire pressure light can come on because of low tire pressure or trouble with the tire pressure sensor. It can also be caused because of a repair that was made without performing the necessary reset. You also want to consider that the car battery is dead and needs to be replaced. In some cases, these problems are going to lead to a solid tire pressure light. Other times, the issue or fault leads the light to blink. Each manufacturer uses different methods to tell you what the problem is. You can find more information in the owner?s manual. Additionally, some vehicles will give you a read-out on what tire is to blame by looking at the infotainment center. "
what are the Causes Of A Blinking Tire Pressure Light ?	"It?s important to know why the light is on if you hope to fix it. In most cases, a blinking tire pressure light issue stems from a lack of pressure or a malfunctioning tire pressure sensor. With a quick diagnosis, you can tell what is causing the problem.Here are some of the common issues leading to a tire pressure light that blinks. 1. Low Tire PressureCheck Tire PressureWhen tire pressures fall, the light comes on to alert you to the danger. This process is the normal operation of the sensor, doing exactly what it was intended to do. Tire pressure can fall because of a leak or failure. It can also decrease over time.One major reason why tire pressures drop is because of a change in temperature. When the outside temperature drops or rises dramatically, the tire pressures can change. For this reason, it?s recommended to keep a close eye on tire pressures, especially during season changes. When temperatures aren?t changing, you should still check the pressures regularly. It?s often recommended to test them once a month before you do any driving because that?s when the tires are cold. 2. Tire Pressure Sensor Lost MemoryTire pressure sensors rely on a battery to operate. If the warning light begins to flash, you may need to have a tire pressure sensor battery replaced. These dead batteries lead to a loss of memory, making it impossible for the sensor to work as intended. Until the battery is replaced, the tire pressure isn?t being read and you are in danger, especially if one tire starts to lose pressure and you don?t know it.In some tire pressure sensors, the battery is not replaceable and you need to replace the whole sensor instead.3. Faulty Tire Pressure SensorTire Pressure SensorThere?s also the chance that the sensor itself has gone bad. These little sensors are located at every tire and are prone to wear over time. Thankfully, it?s not difficult to have a sensor replaced, allowing it to read tire pressures once again. A qualified tire shop can tell which sensor is bad and replace it quickly.4. Changed Wheels Without ResetChange WheelsIf you recently made changes to the wheels or tires, there could be a malfunction with the sensor. When work is done, the sensors need to be reset to work correctly. Most importantly, if you put a new wheel size on the car or you change what type of tires you use, a reset must occur. It?s possible that you forgot to reset them or the tire shop overlooked this step. Either way, there?s nothing mechanically wrong and a simple reset is all that?s needed. 5. Tire Pressure Sensor Not ResetAdditionally, when a new tire pressure sensor is installed, a reset will also be required. This is part of the normal steps to replacing the sensor, but it still gets overlooked.Without the reset, the sensor cannot read the valuable information. Therefore, the light blinks, letting you know there?s a problem. You can have it professionally reset or follow the DIY procedures laid out in some service manuals. 6. Bad Car BatteryThe car battery and alternator are responsible for powering up all of the electronics in the vehicle. If the battery starts to die, it can cause many of the electronics to go haywire, including the tire pressure sensor light.With the blinking light, you should also notice other electrical issues at the same time. For that reason, this is one of the most rare occurrences for a single flashing light, but still possible. "
How To Fix A Blinking Tire Pressure Light ?	"Once you know what the problem is, fixing it shouldn?t be an issue. We?ve put together a few of the possible solutions, but none of these are a replacement for a correct diagnosis to start with. 1. Correct The Tire PressureIn the majority of cases, you simply need to add some air to the tires. Check the driver?s side door panel to see what the right tire pressure is for your vehicle. With that information in hand, you can check the tires to make sure they match.If they don?t match, add the right amount of air. Once the proper air pressure is reached, the light should stop blinking on its own. 2. Reset Tire Pressure LightTpms ButtonIf the tire pressure light needs to be reset, there are multiple ways to handle this procedure. With some vehicles, the light can simply be reset by pressing the appropriate button. You can find this location by reading the owner?s manual. There?s also a TPMS tool that is used by many shops to reset the light.Beyond that, here are some steps that can be done at home with compatible models. Drive the vehicle at 50 mph or more for at least ten minutes. This should cause the tire pressure to reset when you start the car again.You can also turn the key until it reaches the ON setting without starting the engine. Hold the reset button down until the light blinks three times. Start the car and see if it is reset.Inflate the tires slightly beyond where they should be, then deflate them. Once deflated, reinflate every tire until it reaches its recommended amount. In some cars, this will reset the sensor. Some people prefer to disconnect the battery to provide a hard reset to the sensor memory. If you choose to do this, you will need to reset everything that has a memory, including your stereo presets and clock. 3. Read Trouble CodesIf there are other lights on the dashboard, you can read the trouble codes to determine what?s going on. With a mechanical malfunction, you might see another light with the TPMS light.However, not all code scanners are equipped to read the TPMS light. For this reason, you may need to visit a tire shop for a better analysis. 4. Replace & Reprogram Tire Pressure SensorsTpms Sensor ProgrammingIt?s possible that new tire pressure sensors need to be installed and programmed. Because of where the tire pressure sensors sit, dirt and debris can corrode them over time.As an electrical piece of equipment, any malfunction can lead to failure. These sensors aren?t difficult to replace and only take a few minutes to reprogram with the right tools. 5. Replace The Car BatteryIf the electrical issues seem to be widespread, the car may need a new battery. You can have the battery checked at a local auto parts store to see how it?s holding up.If the battery was to blame, the light should reset once a new one is installed. Otherwise, you may need to move on to the next step. 6. Contact A ProfessionalIf you can?t figure out the problem or feel it?s too complicated for your skill level, don?t hesitate to reach out to a professional.

What Does A Flashing Check Engine Light Mean?	"When there?s a concern with the engine or vital car systems, the Check Engine Light comes on to get your attention. The Check Engine Light can come on for hundreds of different reasons or trouble codes. Seeing a flashing Check Engine Light is much rarer. When the Check Engine Light flashes, it designates that the problem is severe and must be dealt with immediately. There are only a handful of concerns that would lead to a flashing light, so it?s often easier to diagnose.While it might be easier to figure out, the problems are normally much more difficult to deal with, often pointing to some level of failure that could be catastrophic if allowed to continue. "
what are the Causes of a Flashing or Blinking Check Engine Light ?	"The most common cause of flashing or blinking check engine light is a misfiring engine, which can be caused by several different engine issues. Ideally, you will want to troubleshoot the vehicle and check the DTCs to find out what?s causing the issues.For now, here are four possible causes worth considering. 1. Misfiring EngineMisfiresWhen an engine misfires, one or more of the cylinders doesn?t produce the power it should. A misfire can be caused by numerous problems, many of which can also lead to a flashing Check Engine Light. For example, you might be dealing with fouled-out spark plugs, a faulty oxygen sensor or a vacuum leak.When the engine misfires, you notice a decrease in acceleration. The car can also start shaking when you try to go faster. It may feel like the vehicle loses power for a period. When it?s idling, the engine might feel like it?s vibrating more than normal. The trouble with a misfire is that it can occur intermittently or only when the engine is at a certain temperature. It?s never wise to continue driving with a misfiring engine. At any time, the engine can quit working on you. Plus, you are allowing additional wear to other parts of the car. If that?s not enough, the engine is going to use more fuel and emissions will be increased during this time. 2. Low Fuel PressureCar Fuel PressureThe combustion chamber needs to have the right balance between fuel and air to ensure proper operation. If the fuel pressure is too low and the engine is starved of fuel, there could be serious problems. Low fuel pressure can be caused by bad injectors, a failing regulator, a broken pump, a clogged fuel filter, or a defective sensor. When the fuel pressure is low, you might notice trouble accelerating. The engine could also misfire or stall as a result. Plus, it?s common to hear a whining noise with fuel problems. Allowing fuel pressure to remain low can put further wear on the engine and vital components. 3. Faulty Engine SensorCar Engine SensorsWithin the engine, there are a number of sensors working together to feed information to the computer. The computer takes this information to make decisions for better operation. If one of the sensors is bad, the computer is receiving faulty information. This problem can cause the computer to make decisions that shouldn?t be made, which leads to an imbalance and serious performance problems.Some of the most common sensor failures include both the oxygen sensor and the mass airflow sensor. However, you could also be looking at a problem with the coolant temperature sensor or any one of the other high-tech features. The only way to know for sure which one is the problem is to scan the codes. 4. Low CompressionFor the engine to run, air and fuel must be present in addition to compression. The compression must reach an exact amount of pressure or there will be performance issues. With a lack of compression, the car can jerk, lose power and fail to accelerate.Some of the top causes for compression issues include damaged piston rings, worn pistons, valve problems or faulty head gasket. However, the problem could also stem from a bad timing belt or chain. "
How to Fix a Flashing Check Engine Light ?	"It?s imperative that you stop driving immediately when the Check Engine Light starts flashing. Once you are pulled over, you can run through these steps to get to the heart of the issue. 1. Scan Trouble CodesScan Trouble CodesTo fix a flashing check engine light, you need to read the trouble codes first. With your professional code scanner, you can read the DTCs that are set in the computer. You can use a variety of OBD-II scanners to figure out what?s going on, but some read more codes than others. Additionally, if you don?t have your own scanner, there are other options. You can go to an auto parts store that offers free scanning services. When you find the trouble codes, you should continue the troubleshooting depending on which codes you find. We have a library here on Mechanic Base to research different trouble codes.2. Inspect Spark Plugs and Ignition CoilsIf the codes lead you to believe that the ignition system is to blame, you should take a look at the spark plugs. When carbon builds up on the plug, it can fail. The only solution is to replace the spark plug.Additionally, if the code shows a problem with the ignition coils, you will need to replace these. The defective coil should be indicated by the trouble code. 3. Check Fuel PressureTo check the fuel pressure, you can use a special gauge. Evaluate the normal reading through your service manual to see where it is supposed to be. You can also use some advanced scanners to check the fuel pressure. If it is too low, you must diagnose what part is causing the problem and replace it. 4. Inspect Engine SensorsYou can?t physically examine every engine sensor on your car. However, the code scanner should help you determine which one might be to blame. Once you pinpoint the sensor that?s bad, there?s a chance you can simply clean it off and reinstall it. Otherwise, a replacement will be necessary. 5. Contact A ProfessionalIt?s important that you take the flashing Check Engine Light seriously. This warning light indicates that something major is occurring. For this reason, it?s sometimes best to consult with a professional. You don?t want to take chances with something as important as your car engine. Whether you need help with diagnostics or repair, take time to search for a reputable repair shop that you can trust. "
Can I Drive With A Blinking Check Engine Light?	"While it might be okay to drive with a solid Check Engine Light, once it starts flashing, it?s time to stop.

When the light starts to blink, find a safe place to pull over and turn the engine off immediately. By taking swift action, you have the chance to prevent further damage. With a code scanner or through the help of a professional mechanic, you can figure out what went wrong and begin the repair."
what is the Battery Discharge Warning Kia Meaning ?	"Modern Kia and Hyundai vehicles are equipped with a battery feature that ensures the power isn?t discharged faster than it is replenished. If you are using the battery to run accessories without starting the engine, the battery discharge warning light will eventually come on to let you know that the battery needs to be recharged.Additionally, it can come on if there?s a problem with the battery charge while the engine is running. This problem stems back to some sort of mechanical failure and will likely be more complicated to repair. "
what are the Causes of Battery Discharge Warning With Engine Off ?	"The most common cause of a Battery Discharge warning message in your Kia when the engine is off is because you are using accessories such as the car stereo, charging port, or have the ignition on with the engine off. This will cause the battery to drain, and you may have trouble starting the vehicle later.1. Stereo SystemCar Stereo Head UnitYou can turn on the accessories by rotating the key in the ignition to the appropriate spot. With the key in place, you can play your radio without starting the engine. This is a great way to save fuel, but will also drain the battery.All of these electronic devices are powered by a battery. If you have a high-powered stereo system with performance speakers and an amp, it?s going to go through power much faster than a factory setup. 2. Charging Port UsageToday?s vehicles come with a variety of charging ports, some of which can remain powered on when the engine is off. If you keep your mobile phone plugged in when you aren?t in the vehicle, you are taking power from the battery that can?t be replaced.When the battery becomes drained, the warning light will come on. For this reason, it?s best to unplug everything you aren?t using before you leave your car. 3. HeadlightsHave you ever left your headlights on when you walked away from your car? It?s a common mistake, especially when the headlights are on during the day.Because the headlights run off of the battery during this time, you may come back to a dead battery when you are ready to go somewhere. However, before that, the warning light would come on. You just might not be in the car to see it. 4. Climate ControlCar Air Climate ControlsIt?s not normally a good practice to run your heat or air conditioning without the engine on. Not only will it cause a significant drain on the battery, but the air won?t be nearly as hot or cold as it could be with the motor running.If you choose to run the system with the engine off, you are going to drain the battery over time. It would be better if you idled the engine during these times. 5. Loosened Battery TerminalsWhen the engine is off, the battery isn?t being recharged by the alternator. There should be nothing depleting the battery during this time, so it doesn?t need to be recharged in most circumstances.However, if one of the battery connections is loose, it could cause drainage. Because the car isn?t running, this drainage can?t be compensated for and the battery might die. 6. Old BatteryIf your battery has reached its end of life, it might be draining on its own. The electrodes, cells and plates inside the battery have reached their limit.For this reason, it?s not going to hold a charge effectively. While it is parked, it could drain overnight, leaving you with a dead battery. 7. Parasitic DrainWhen there?s a parasitic drain in the car, something is using power when it shouldn?t. It could be caused by any electrical malfunction, from the heated seats to the windshield wiper motor.When you park for the night, this malfunction continues to draw power from the battery, with no way to replace it. Depending on how severe it is, you could have a dead battery in just a few hours. 8. Extreme Weather ConditionsMost batteries are designed to stand up against a variety of weather conditions. However, if the battery is old and ready to be replaced, any extreme weather can wipe it out.It doesn?t matter if you are facing cold winter temperatures or scorching hot summer weather, both are hard on the battery. For this reason, it?s best to test your battery before the season changes and to park in a garage for more protection. "

These warnings can occur for minor and major problems.The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is responsible for turning on the Check Gauges Light. If one of the gauges is outside of its normal range, not only will a warning come on for that system, but this light will also be set. The Check Gauges Light can be yellow, orange or red. It can also come on solid or start flashing.The Check Gauges Light illuminates when there is a wrong reading from:Coolant temperatureOil pressureVoltmeterFuel levelTire pressureWheel SpeedEngine RPMYou can reference the owner?s manual to get more information about the combination of lights that you see. "
what are the Check Gauges Light Causes ?	"The most common causes of a Check Gauge Light are bad engine ground, low battery voltage or a faulty gauge sensor such as the coolant temperature sensor, oil pressure sensor, or tire pressure sensor. It can also be caused by low fluid levels.Here is a more detailed list of the causes of a Check Gauges light.1. Bad Engine GroundCar Ground WireThe most common cause when it comes to the Check Gauges Light is poor ground between the engine and your car?s chassis. Usually, there are one or more ground wires running between them, and if the ground point is corroded or rusty, it can lose the connection.When the ground is bad, it will cause incorrect readings from the engine?s sensors, which will result in a check gauge.2. Coolant Temp Sensor or Engine OverheatingCoolant Temperature Sensor LocationThere are several causes that can lead to an overheating engine, but all causes should also create the temperature warning light on the dashboard. With this could also come the Check Gauges Light. The most common reason for this is a bad coolant temperature sensor that?s sending the wrong data to the engine control module and instrument cluster, but it can also be caused by coolant issues such as a bad thermostat or an overheating engine.When the engine starts to overheat, you might have some warning. You could see the temperature gauge rising on the dashboard if your car has one. You might also smell something burning or see some leakage underneath your vehicle. 3. Oil Pressure Sensor or Reduced Oil PressureOil Pressure Sensor LocationThe engine requires a certain amount of oil pressure to ensure proper operation. If the oil pressure drops, the motor won?t have the lubrication it needs and the Check Engine Light could come on. You may also see an oil pressure warning light, along with the Check Gauges Light. In most cases, the reduced oil pressure is caused by a bad oil pressure sensor or low oil. There could also be a defect with the oil filter. Furthermore, if you use the wrong oil or choose an inappropriate viscosity, problems are sure to arise. 4. Faulty Fuel Level SenderInside your car?s fuel tank is a fuel level sender that sends information about how much fuel is in the fuel tank. If there is a problem with this transmitter unit or the wiring to the instrument cluster, it will send the wrong data, and a Check Gauges light will appear on your dashboard.5. Dead Battery/Blown FuseThere?s a battery warning light on your dashboard that indicates when there are charging problems. When this light comes on, there may also be a warning to check the gauges. Even though this light shows a battery, it can mean a multitude of things. You may need to replace the battery, but it could also show you that there?s trouble with the alternator or electrical connections.Additionally, a blown fuse can lead to many complications, some of which appear confusing depending on what system is affected. You can check the fuses to see what?s blown and replace it with a fuse that runs on the same amperage. 6. Improper Tire PressureCheck Tire PressureWith each tire, your modern vehicle has sensors to monitor the pressure. If the pressure gets too low or high, based on manufacturer specs, the warning light will come on. This can also cause the Check Gauges Light to illuminate.Running a vehicle with the wrong amount of tire air pressure can be disastrous. You could blow out a tire or run it flat, both of which could cause a major accident. It can also be caused by a faulty tire pressure sensor.7. Ignored MaintenanceFor your car to run right, you must follow the recommended maintenance schedule. These schedules are put out by the manufacturer and show you what tasks should be performed at particular intervals. Regular maintenance could include tire rotation, oil changes, spark plug replacement, air filter replacement and so much more.If you choose to ignore the maintenance, the car will stop running right. Clogged filters and contaminated oil can cause any number of problems, including dashboard warning lights. To prevent this, you want to follow all recommendations. 8. Defective ComputerIn your car, there could be several computers that keep everything running as it should. These computers read the information coming from the sensors and ensure that adjustments are made to match what?s happening.While it doesn?t happen often, any one of these computers can malfunction. Whether it is the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) or the Electronic Control Unit (ECU), there?s always the chance that it needs an update or replacement. When this time comes, you should notice multiple issues occurring at once. "

What Does A Car With Lock Symbol Mean?	"The car showing a lock symbol indicates that the security system is activated. This system is designed to enhance security and prevent theft from occurring. If someone tries to steal the car or open the doors without the key, the car and lock symbol can start flashing on the dashboard. With that said, there are also times when the system activates, and theft isn?t occurring. For this reason, it?s important to walk through a complete diagnostic procedure to figure out what?s wrong. "
what are the Causes of Car with Lock Symbol  ?	"The most common cause of a car with lock symbol is a bad key fob or low battery in the key fob. It can also be due to low battery voltage in the car, a faulty immobilizer, bad door lock or attempted theft.Here is a more detailed list of the causes of a car with lock symbol.1. Bad Key FobKey Fob BatteryThe most common reason for a car with lock symbol is a faulty key fob or a dead battery in the fob. Your car?s key fob is designed to lock and unlock the doors. In some cases, it can also start the engine through the way of a proximity key or if it has a remote start feature. However, if something happens to the key fob, either because of a low key fob battery or a damaged unit, it could interfere with the security system. In some cases, you would notice these problems happening slowly before the key fob stops working entirely. 2. Low BatteryCar Battery VoltageA weak or dying car battery can lead to the same situation. Without a strong signal, the key memory could be lost, even if it is right next to the car. When the system can?t read the key fob, it will assume that someone is trying to steal the car.Other electrical problems can lead to a similar outcome. For example, if the fuse goes out, it will act the same as if the battery were dead. 3. Failing ImmobilizerThe immobilizer is a system of its own. While unlikely, there?s always a chance that there?s a fault within the system itself.Because the immobilizer runs on sensors, any failure could lead to the warning light. Once damage occurs, the proper disable code won?t be received and the car with lock symbol will remain on. 4. Damaged Key LockThe other part of the equation is the key lock. If the lock becomes damaged or you attempt to use the wrong key, the anti-theft system is going to activate.To prevent theft, the immobilizer turns on and the car with lock symbol comes on the dashboard. While the system is sophisticated, it can?t easily tell the difference between forced entry and a broken door lock. 5. Attempted TheftThere?s always the possibility that someone tried to steal the vehicle. Whether someone tried to jimmy the lock and ignition or they attempted to use a different key, the system is working as it was intended.As soon as the attempted theft is recognized, the immobilizer is meant to prevent the car from starting. With this system, the car won?t be able to be stolen easily. "
How to Fix Car With Lock Symbol ?	"To fix a car with lock symbol, you want to replace the battery in your key fob and inspect the car locks. Then you should try your spare key fob, if you see the same issue, you know there is an issue with the original key fob.1. Inspect Key Fob/Door LocksKey Fob Battery ReplacementConsidering the most likely cause of your problem is either the key fob or the lock, it?s important to begin the inspection here. Check the key fob battery, as these only last a few years at a time. If you can?t use the key fob to unlock or lock the doors, it?s worth replacing the battery. Most batteries only cost around $5. If the key fob doesn?t work after replacing the battery, it may be damaged. You need to have it replaced. The cost for a new key fob can vary based on what it?s used for. If it doesn?t need to be reprogrammed by the dealer, you may only spend $50 online to get a new one. However, the cost can quickly become more than $200 if the dealership is your only option. You may also need to program it to the immobilizer, which only a locksmith or the dealership can do.Your next step is to look at the door locks. If the door locks are damaged, the anti-theft warning system could be triggered. Finally, an inspection of the ignition cylinder must be examined. If someone tried to break in and mess with the ignition, it could be damaged. This is what happens when a thief attempts to jam a screwdriver into the lock cylinder. Sadly, you will probably need to replace the ignition to fix this problem. 2. Try Spare KeyTake a look at your car key next. If it?s damaged, the system might think you are trying to break in. You can try a spare key in the lock to see if that fixes the problem. If so, you might need a new key.Not all modern cars use a physical key anymore, so this step might be skippable. If you only use the key fob system and a proximity key, this step doesn?t apply to you. 3. Replace Dead BatteryLocate BatteryIf the battery isn?t charged fully, the same problems can occur. Start by unplugging the battery terminals to perform a reset and charge the car battery. After ten minutes, you can reconnect the battery to see if that fixes the problem. However, doing this will also reset the electronics, including your clock and radio presets.If that doesn?t fix the car with a lock symbol, it might be time to see if the battery is dying. If so, replace the battery to resolve the problem. 4. Attempt to Start the CarThe car probably won?t start while the car and lock symbol are on the dashboard. For this reason, you must first attempt to turn off the light before you can start it. Put the key in the ignition and see if the light begins to flash. Once the car doesn?t start, you can switch the ignition back off and wait a few minutes. If the security system stops flashing, it has disabled itself and you can try to start the vehicle once again.5. Use a Physical KeyIf you have a physical key that can be used on the doors, try this method to reset the system. Some key fobs contain a hidden key that can be pulled out for a time such as this. Insert the key into the door and attempt to unlock it. Don?t open the door if it unlocks. Instead, leave the door unlocked for about a minute. In this minute, the security system should recognize that you are using the right key and disable it.You can also attempt locking and unlocking the door several times. This method can cause a reset that disables the system. 6. Check FuseThe car immobilizer uses a fuse to run the electrical connection. Fuses are not bulletproof, so there?s always the chance that it needs to be replaced.Find the proper fuse to check by looking at the diagram in your service manual. You also need to make sure that the fuse is the same amperage as the one you are replacing. 7. Call Locksmith/MechanicIf the above steps haven?t brought you to a resolution, it?s time to seek professional guidance. If the trouble seems to revolve around the lock or key, you might do better to reach out to a locksmith.Otherwise, diagnostics should be performed by a qualified mechanic. If there?s a malfunction with the immobilizer itself, you may not be experienced enough to handle the repair. "

what are the Causes of Steering Assist Is Reduced Drive With Care Message ?	"The most common cause of the ?Steering Assist Is Reduced, Drive With Care? message is due to low battery voltage and a stored trouble code in the steering assist control module. It can also be due to a bad thermostat or a bad power steering control module.Here is a more detailed list of the possible causes of the Steering Assist Is Reduced Drive With Care message:1. Low Battery Voltage or Bad Car BatteryCar Battery VoltageSteering Assist will malfunction if the electrical supply is interrupted. Power is supplied to these advanced systems through multiple avenues. For starters, the battery must supply the vehicle with its power. If the battery has been disconnected or is dying, many of today?s safety systems can malfunction.You can also run into the same problems if there?s a loose or corroded connection or wire. The most common reason for the Steering Assist Is Reduced Drive With Care message is actually that the battery voltage dipped low. If that is the case, there is a trouble code stored in the steering assist control module, which I will talk more about in the next step.2. Old Trouble Code StoredCar Trouble CodesIf the voltage in the car drops low at any time, or if an electrical failure occurs, there will be a trouble code stored in the steering assist control module. Whenever there is a trouble code stored in this control module, the warning message Steering Assist is Reduced Drive With Care will be displayed.Therefore, if there was just a temporarily low voltage or another electrical issue, it can be resolved by just clearing the trouble codes in this control module.3. Stuck Open ThermostatThermostat Location E1609868130278If you see the Steering Assist Is Reduced message together with a P0128 code on your scanner, it can be caused by an issue with the cooling system. If you have a GMC, Cadillac or Chevrolet car, there is a technical service bulletin about this issue.The engine thermostat is responsible for regulating the flow of coolant through the radiator and engine. It ensures that the temperature of the engine is always within normal operating parameters.If the thermostat gets stuck open, fluid is going to continue rushing through unchecked. It will cause the engine to run too cool. Because the temperatures aren?t right, the Steering Assist system will malfunction, causing the warning light and an error code. 4. Broken Temperature SensorSpeaking of the engine temperature, you should also look at the sensor. The temperature sensor is responsible for telling how hot or cold the engine is. If the sensor reads high, the engine is hot and vice versa.When the car has been running a good amount of time and the gauge still reads low, there could be a mechanical failure, like I discussed earlier, or the sensor could be broken. Because the ECM isn?t getting the appropriate data, the Steering Assist will malfunction. 5. Defective Steering Assist ModuleDepending on your car model, there is often a steering assistant or power steering module that reads data from the car and manages the steering assist function for you.In some cases, the module or sensors are defective, requiring replacement. Other times, it could be the result of a Steering Assist Module that requires an update or is no longer working correctly. However, this problem usually leads to other issues too. "

What Does The VSA Light In A Honda Mean?	"The VSA light indicates that there is an issue with the Vehicle Stability Assist system and that a trouble code is stored in the control module. The letters VSA mean Vehicle Stability Assist when referring to Honda or Acura vehicles.This system is responsible for keeping the vehicle handling its best, thereby preventing situations that create oversteer or understeer. If the wheels have varied amounts of grip, skidding occurs more frequently without the VSA system. In hazardous conditions, the VSA system might activate because of the weather. It can also come on when you drive over loose surfaces or you take a corner too fast. With VSA, the drive is much smoother and there?s less of a chance of slipping.The advanced technology changes the output coming from the engine automatically, so each wheel gets the torque it needs. It can also apply the brakes on individual wheels to further improve the traction and maintain control. When the VSA light comes on the dashboard, it doesn?t automatically mean that something is wrong. In fact, the light is expected to blink when attempting to regain traction. You will also often see the VSA light together with a triangle with an exclamation mark symbol."
what are the Causes of Honda VSA Light ?	"The most common cause of a Honda VSA light is that you have accidentally pressed the VSA button or that you are driving with low tire pressure. It can also be caused by a faulty component such as a bad steering angle sensor, ABS wheel speed sensor, or ABS reluctor ring.Here is more detailed information on the most common causes of the VSA light in a Honda.1. Switch Turned OffVsa Off ButtonIf you have turned off the system, the VSA light will be on. Some people prefer to turn the system off during certain driving situations and the button can normally be reactivated at any time on the console. It?s also possible that you have turned off the system by accident. If so, clicking the button will turn the system back on and the light should turn off. 2. Wrong TiresInspect TireIf the wheels aren?t rotating at the same pace, the VSA system will detect a problem. Normally, if it?s just a traction issue, the VSA light blinks and goes off once traction has been regained. However, when the wheels aren?t right, the system could notice the imbalance in rotation happening all of the time. Therefore, the system light will remain on. 3. Low Tire PressureRun-Flat TiresDriving with low tire pressure in one or more tires will cause the same problems as driving with the wrong wheels or tires. This will cause the wheels to spin at different speeds and may cause the VSA warning light to come on.Therefore, it is important to always drive with the correct tire pressure and check the tire pressure regularly.3. Failed ComponentsAbs Sensor CloseIf neither of the other reasons is causing the VSA light to remain on, your problem is usually due to a failed part. The only way to determine what part has caused a malfunction is to have the vehicle inspected and diagnosed with a scanner. Some common components that could cause a VSA light on your Honda include:Failed steering angle sensorABS wheel speed sensorABS reluctor ringFailed ABS control moduleFaulty Sensor WiringIn some cases, it could be the steering angle switch causing issues. Otherwise, it might be a bad wheel speed sensor or defective wiring. "
How to Fix VSA Light on Honda Models ?	"To fix the VSA light in your Honda, you want to make sure that the VSA button is not pressed accidentally. You also want to make sure the tire pressure is correct in all tires. Then you need to scan the fault codes with a diagnostic scanner to continue the diagnosis.1. Turn on ButtonYour first step should always be trying to activate the system. Find the VSA button on your car and attempt to activate it.In many cars, the VSA switch is located on the console. If you can?t find it, take a look at the owner?s manual for its location. 2. Inflate and Inspect tiresThe next thing you want to do is to inflate all the tires in your car to the correct tire pressure. You also want to make sure all the tires and wheels are the same size. Also, make sure the tires have about the same wear all around.This is because if the rotation speed of the wheels varies, it can cause a VSA warning light to appear on your dashboard.2. Scan CodesObd ScannerIf the switch or tires doesn?t turn off the light, you want to use your code scanner to see what?s wrong. However, not all code scanners will read the VSA, so you need to find a compatible device.Start by resetting the codes. After that, take the vehicle for a test drive until the light comes back on. Now, you will be able to read the most frequent codes that were set in the system. With this information, you can repair whatever is causing the problem. 3. Reset/Replace Steering Angle SensorModern vehicles have a steering angle sensor that?s attached directly to the steering column. If the code scanner reveals something is wrong with this sensor, you may need to reset or replace it. This sensor is responsible for relaying the steering angle to the module, which is needed to ensure on-road stability.With most reset procedures, you need to turn the steering wheel to either side and back to the center. This procedure can be found in the service manual for your model. If a reset doesn?t work, a replacement might be needed. 4. Replace Wheel Speed SensorThe wheel speed sensors are responsible for sending information about the speed of the vehicle back to the computer. If the sensors are sending faulty information to the computer, the VSA system may think something is wrong and turn off. When a wheel speed sensor goes bad, it can also cause problems with the ABS. For this reason, you may also see an ABS light on the dashboard. You also want to ensure that the ABS reluctor rings are not bad or cracked.5. Repair Defective Wiring/ConnectionIf the wiring is defective in any of these systems, the symptoms will be the same as if the sensor was bad. You can take a look at the wiring and connectors to see if you notice any obvious defects.Unless there?s something clearly wrong, you may have trouble hunting down the problem. For this reason, it might be best to move to the next step. 6. Visit Professional MechanicOnce you?ve performed all of the diagnostic procedures and repairs you feel comfortable with, it?s time to trust the professionals. You may only need to spend an hour for diagnostics to figure out what the problem is.Also, if the repair becomes too complicated for your expertise, it?s best to trust a local shop. You don?t want to accidentally break anything else because of your lack of knowledge. "
what are the Symptoms of Honda VSA Light ?	"1. Engine Power is HarnessedIf the VSA light starts to blink, you may notice that the engine power decreases automatically. There?s nothing wrong with the system. In fact, it?s operating just as it should.To regain control, the engine will limit the power and apply torque just where it?s needed. This process is making your travels safer. 2. Automatic Application of BrakesThe system can also apply the brakes automatically. You may notice this happen to multiple wheels or just one at a time. Brakes are applied when traction is lost to ensure you regain control of the vehicle. Again, the VSA light should only blink during this operation and will turn off when traction is regained. 3. VSA System FailureIf the VSA system has been turned off or there is a failure to the components, the light will remain on the dashboard. It?s possible that the system was disabled through the switch on your console.Otherwise, a solid light indicates that the system isn?t working because of a failure. However, the failure isn?t always directly related to the VSA system itself. Many components can cause the system to turn off, as seen in a minute. "

If there?s a fault, it?s best to have it fixed as soon as possible to ensure your on-road safety remains intact."
Why Would the VSA Light Come On?	"The VSA light indicates that there?s something wrong with the Vehicle Stability Assist on your Honda or Acura vehicle. If something interferes with the traction of your vehicle temporarily, the light could blink. If the light comes on and remains solid, there could be a problem or you might have turned the button off. "
How Do I Fix My VSA Light On My Honda?	"Start by pushing the button on the console that activates and deactivates the system. If that doesn?t turn off the light, you want to run your compatible code scanner to see what?s causing the defect. With this information, you can follow through with the appropriate fix to turn off the warning light. "
What Does VSA Mean On a Honda?	"VSA means Vehicle Stability Assist. It?s a proprietary system for Honda and Acura vehicles, comparable to an electronic stability control system in other vehicles. It?s meant to reduce engine torque and apply select braking when a wheel starts to lose traction across slippery or wet surfaces. "
Can Low Tire Pressure Cause the VSA Light to Come On?	"Whenever one tire rotates at a different speed than the others, the VSA system can detect a problem and try to correct it. For this reason, it?s possible that the tire pressure is causing problems, but you would get additional warnings if this is the case. The Check TPMS System message should also display. "
Conclusion	"The VSA light points to the Vehicle Stability Assist system of Honda and Acura models. It can come on to detect normal situations or to alert you to a problem, which is why you must know how to diagnose it. If the VSA system gets turned off, handling can be compromised. There?s no reason to panic when you first see the VSA light on your Honda vehicle. It could be something as simple as needing to reactivate the system.

What Does A Check Emission System Message Mean?	"When the Check Emissions System message appears, it means that one of the components in the emissions system is not working properly. In many cars such as Hondas or Acuras, you will see this warning message instead of, or along with the traditional Check Engine light.The engine control module monitors all the engine sensors and actuators in the car engine, and if there is a component that could cause problems with the emissions, the Check Emission System message will appear on the dashboard."
What Causes A Check Emission System Message?	"The most common causes of a Check Emission System message are a faulty oxygen sensor, loose gas cap, dirty air filter, worn catalytic converter, or an exhaust or intake leak. However, it could be caused by almost any faulty engine sensor, so it?s important to read the trouble codes.Here is a more detailed list of the common causes of a check emission system warning message on your dashboard:1. Loose Gas CapCar Gas CapIf you?ve recently been to a fuel station, you might have left the gas cap loose. It?s easy to get distracted by everything that?s going on around you at the gas station. This is one of the most manageable problems to deal with that causes the Check Emission System message. It can also lead to a Check Engine Light, which is always troublesome. Aside from being loose, it?s possible that the gas cap has become damaged or broken. Furthermore, you might have misplaced the gas cap altogether, thereby leaving the fuel filler neck open.  2. Bad Oxygen SensorOxygen SensorOne of the most common emissions faults is a bad oxygen sensor. This sensor monitors how much oxygen is coming through the exhaust. Most cars have several of these sensors in various positions.When the oxygen levels are too high or too low, the engine will attempt to make appropriate modifications. If there?s still an imbalance, the Check Emission System and Check Engine lights can come on. 3. Dirty Air FilterSymptoms Of A Dirty Air FilterThere?s an air filter in the engine that needs to remove impurities from the flow entering the motor. If the air filter becomes contaminated, the flow might decrease.Since the engine needs a particular amount of air and fuel to create the proper amount of power, any imbalance in this ratio can cause the warning lights to come on. You might also notice some performance issues because the engine is starving of air. 4. Worn-Out Catalytic ConverterThe catalytic converter is another culprit of the warning lights. This vital part is needed to convert the harmful emissions coming out of the exhaust into something safer for the environment. Over time, the precious metals inside the converter break down. These materials are needed to create the chemical reaction that converts the gases. 5. Exhaust or Intake LeakIf there?s an exhaust leak anywhere in the exhaust system, the warning lights can come on the dash. It?s difficult to determine where the exhaust leak is and what?s causing it because of how many components you are dealing with.Your problem could be something as small as a loose clamp or bolt. On the other hand, the manifold or an exhaust pipe could also be cracked. You?ll also want to inspect the intake system to make sure there aren?t any cracked hoses causing a vacuum leak.6. Engine SensorThe check emission system message can appear due to a problem with almost any car sensor on your car engine, which is why it is important to read the error codes, which we will talk about more about later in the article.Some other common engine sensors that can cause this problem are the MAF sensor, the MAP sensor, the engine coolant temperature sensor, and the intake air temperature sensor."
how to Check Emission System Message Fixes ?	"To fix the check emission system message, you need to inspect the gas cap and make sure it?s properly tightened. Then you need to read the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner and continue troubleshooting with the information you got from those codes.1. Inspect/Replace Gas CapThe easiest solution is to take a peek at your gas cap. If you left it off slightly, a simple adjustment would get you back on the road quickly. It?s also possible that the gas cap is broken, which would require a replacement.Thankfully, replacing a gas cap doesn?t need to be expensive. On average, you might only spend $10 to $25 for a new gas cap. 2. Check Trouble CodesCheck Trouble Codes With ScannerIf the gas cap can?t be to blame, it?s time to scan the engine for codes. With your OBDII code scanner, you can pinpoint where the problem lies. When the check emission system message appears, there is a trouble code stored in the engine control module that you will want to read, as it will make troubleshooting much easier.In some cases, the solution might be self-explanatory, making it easy to fix. Other times, you have to do further troubleshooting to figure out what?s going on. As an example, you might see a code that shows one of the oxygen sensors is bad but trying to figure out which one can be more complicated. You might need to reference your car?s service manual for more guidance. 3. Replace Engine Air FilterIf your codes indicate that there is an issue with the airflow or air-fuel mixture, checking and replacing the filter might be a good option. Check the air filter, and if it?s dirty, you need to replace it. With most vehicles, it?s simple to replace the air filter with some basic tools.Additionally, it doesn?t cost a lot to replace the air filter. On average, you may spend $20 to $75 for this replacement if you can do it yourself. 4. Look for Exhaust and Intake LeaksIf you aren?t accustomed to finding an exhaust leak, you may need some help with this step. There are special smoke machines that can be done to find the leak.Obviously, if you see a physical defect in a pipe or the muffler, you already know where the leak is coming from, making it easier to fix. Otherwise, it could cost you two to three hours of diagnosis from a shop to figure out the problem. Additionally, fixing the exhaust leak will vary in cost from $100 to $2,000, depending on what?s wrong. You also want to look for intake leaks. On many Honda and Acura engines, you need to check the large hose between the MAF sensor and the intake manifold for cracks.5. Diagnose the Catalytic ConverterIf you see a P0420 code with the code scanner or another code related to the emission, you want to check the catalytic converter. Above all, you don?t want to deal with a failed catalytic converter. It?s one of the most expensive fixes, not because it?s difficult to do, but because of the high price of parts due to the precious metals.On average, you can spend $900 to $2,500 on this repair. Your best bet is to keep the cat in optimal condition to ensure a replacement isn?t needed. To do this, you want to keep the engine tuned up and remember to replace any failed parts as soon as you can. 6. Ask for More HelpMany of these fixes are simple for the average household mechanic. Whether you are replacing a gas cap, changing an air filter or reading trouble codes, you should have no trouble resolving the issue on your own.However, there are many more complicated issues you could be facing. If you aren?t familiar with these problems or you are unsure how to fix the warning light, it?s best to get help from a professional. In these cases, you want to search for a reliable mechanic in your area that can get the problem fixed quickly. While price should be a main factor in who you choose, don?t automatically pick the cheapest mechanic. Instead, you want one with good reviews that seems to care about their customers. You may even get a warranty on the work that?s performed, giving you further value for your money. "
Can I Drive With the Check Emission System Message On?	"If the Check Emission System message is on your dashboard and nothing else is illuminated, it might be okay to continue driving for a short time. However, it?s difficult to tell because you won?t yet know what?s wrong with the vehicle. Ideally, you would only drive the vehicle home so you could diagnose what?s going on. For several reasons, we don?t recommend driving with the light on if you can help it. For starters, with the light on, you may not know when something more serious occurs. Additionally, you could start facing performance issues that make it more difficult to drive your vehicle. This could occur at any time with no warning. It?s also not a safe practice to get into. If the car starts acting up while you are driving, you could cause an accident. For example, if the car starts stalling because of performance problems, you could get rear-ended and face injury. It?s also not going to pass emissions testing with this light on. If you live in an area where you need to get this test, you want to repair the problem before your appointment. Finally, driving with a faulty emissions system can cause damage to other parts of the car. For example, if you are driving with a bad oxygen sensor, you could be putting more wear on the catalytic converter. As we discussed previously, the cost of replacing the converter is much more than you want to deal with, so it?s better to replace the broken part immediately."

What Does The Drivetrain Malfunction Message on BMW Mean?	"When the drivetrain malfunction message appears, it indicates that there is a problem with an engine or transmission component. It can be a problem with the vehicle?s ignition or fuel system, but it is sometimes a problem with the transmission.Depending on the problem, strange symptoms occur, which could include the fail-safe driving mode. The engine?s computer determines the fault and alerts you to the problem with the message. At the same time, the fail-safe driving mode, otherwise known as limp mode, might be activated. This mode ensures that no further damage occurs to the engine or transmission, giving you the time you need to get your car to a safe location for repair. "
what are the Causes of BMW Drivetrain Malfunction ?	"There are many different causes of the BMW drivetrain malfunction message, and the best way to determine what is wrong is to read the trouble codes. Here are some common causes of the BMW powertrain error message:1. Fouled Spark PlugsSpark PlugA misfiring engine is sure to lead to a Drivetrain Malfunction error. One of the main culprits of a misfire is fouled spark plugs. Your problem could be one plug or multiple. As the plugs become older, they can no longer provide the spark required to keep the engine running right. If you were to continue driving like this, you could cause permanent damage to the catalytic converter and engine. That?s why it?s important to perform tune-ups at regular service intervals.2. Failed Ignition CoilsIgnition coils provide the necessary electricity to the car?s spark plugs, so engine operation can continue. When the coils go bad, power can?t be distributed to the spark plugs. As a result, you will notice a misfiring engine and a loss of power. There will also be noticeable performance issues while idling. You wouldn?t normally replace the ignition coils at regular intervals. They are only replaced when they go bad. 3. Malfunctioning Fuel PumpThe engine requires the right amount of fuel to work its best. If the Drivetrain Malfunction error occurs, there could be a problem with the fuel getting to the engine. If the pump has failed, you will notice this warning, along with several performance issues.Because the fuel pump is responsible for transferring gas to the engine, any failure will lead to starvation of the motor. You will see an inconsistent supply of fuel, leading to power loss and random surging. Once the pump fails completely, it can be impossible to start the engine. 4. Failing Fuel InjectorsThe fuel injectors are also a vital part of the fuel system. The injectors push the fuel into the combustion chamber of the engine. If one gets damaged, the fuel won?t get where it needs to go.Instead, you will end up dealing with a misfiring engine, stalling, strange vibrations, or a rough idle. It could also keep you from starting the engine. 5. Bad Catalytic ConverterThe catalytic converter is a vital part of the emissions system. Inside the catalytic converter, there are precious metals that help to convert dangerous gases into products that can be dispersed into the environment. It turns CO, NO2, and NO into carbon dioxide and water vapor. When the catalytic converter fails, the exhaust emission rate slows down, leading to a build-up of pressure. With a clog in the converter, the combustion chamber flow can slow down as well, causing a stalling situation and a Drivetrain Malfunctioning message. "
How To Fix The BMW Drivetrain Malfunction Message?	"To fix the BMW drivetrain malfunction message, you need to read the error codes from the engine and transmission control modules with an OBD2 scanner to determine what is causing the problem. You can also try restarting the engine and inspecting the engine quickly.Here is a more detailed list of how to fix the BMW drivetrain malfunction warning message:1. Restart MotorWhen the error first pops up on the dash, you want to pull over safely to the side of the road. It?s best to turn the engine off and let it sit for a moment. There?s always the chance that the message is just a fluke. After five to ten minutes of resting, restart the engine. However, you want to skip this step if the car message comes on and the drivetrain goes into limp mode. In this case, it?s best to simply get the car where it needs to be, because it might not start again once you shut down the engine. 2. Inspect EngineBefore you go any further, it?s best to take a quick look at the engine. It?s possible that there?s a simple fault that can be repaired to get you back on the road. For example, there might be an oil or transmission fluid leak that needs to be repaired. If you notice anything obvious, you?ll have a better idea of what needs to happen next.3. Scan CodesObd ScannerIf there?s no visible reason for the warning message, it?s time to use your code-scanning tool. Make sure your scan tool is compatible with your BMW vehicle before proceeding. With most BMW vehicles, the DME (digital motor electronic) is responsible for storing codes coming out of the engine, while the EGS (electronic gearbox) or AGS (adaptive gearbox) sends out the codes from the transmission. You will need to scan both modules to get all of the error codes.Here?s what the steps look like to get the codes.Find the OBD II port in your BMW. It?s usually located below the dashboard on the driver?s side.Plug your code scanner into the port. Turn the key in the ignition to the On position. Do not start the engine.Select the appropriate vehicle model and specs in your scanner.Read all of the DTCs coming from the DME and the EGS/AGS modules.Make a note of the trouble codes so you know what you are dealing with. If you aren?t able to get the codes because you don?t have a compatible scanner, you will need to move on to visit a mechanic. You don?t want to guess what the problem is.4. Repair FaultsWith the codes in hand, you should have a better idea about what should be fixed. You might be able to perform some of the more basic repairs yourself. The cost will vary based on what needs to be repaired and whether you need help from a professional.As an example, changing the spark plugs might cost you $100 or less, especially if you can do it yourself. On the other hand, replacing the catalytic converter could run $950 to $2,500, even if you don?t need a professional?s help. You should also look for technical service bulletins, because many BMW models have bulletins about the drivetrain malfunction issue.5. Get Help from a MechanicIf the job seems to be too complicated at any stage in the diagnosis or repair, it?s time to get help from a professional. You may need to find a specialized BMW mechanic, as these luxury cars aren?t meant to be worked on by just anyone.Not only should a specialized scanner be used, but some of the repairs go beyond what?s ordinary. You will pay more to visit a BMW mechanic, but the guarantee you get is enough to provide peace of mind. "

What Does The Battery Saver Active Message Mean?	"The Battery Saver Active warning message shows that the battery will no longer hold a charge or is running down too low. To conserve the power, the computer will automatically shut down some of the electrical components to preserve the life of the battery. However, you could still end up stranded if the battery drains completely. The battery saver system will maximize the current from the alternator and battery, whatever is being provided. With the help of the PCM (powertrain control module) and the battery sensor, the system can adequately determine how much charge is remaining.The rationing of power helps to keep the battery running longer, so you have time to pull over in a safe location or possibly get home. With this warning, you may not face an immediate shutdown. "
What Causes The Battery Saver Active Message?	"The Battery Saver Active warning message is in most cases caused by a bad alternator, that?s not able to charge the car battery properly. It is also common that the battery itself is bad and won?t hold the power that the alternator provides.Here is a more detailed list of the causes of a Battery Saver Active warning message:1. Failing AlternatorAlternator LocationThe alternator is responsible for keeping the battery charged and is the most common reason why the Battery Saver Active message comes up. While the engine is running, the alternator will provide a charge to the battery while also supplying power to the electrical components. As long as the engine is running, many of the accessories, such as the radio and headlights, are running through the alternator. If the alternator is failing, it can no longer adequately charge the battery while you are driving. For this reason, the battery might start to die with no chance of getting it back up to optimal power.2. Dead BatteryLocate BatteryAnother common reason to see this warning light is due to a dead car battery, especially if you saw this message when the engine was not running. As the battery becomes weaker, it can no longer hold a charge. If it is holding less than 12.4 volts, the sensor will report the problem to the computer, causing the warning to illuminate.To conserve power, the system shuts down any electrical equipment that is no longer needed. You may not have a lot of time to pull the car over before the battery fails completely. 3. Bad ConnectionTo ensure that the battery works as it should and the alternator can supply adequate power, the connections must be solid. The charging system is made up of several connectors and cables, all of which need to be secure.If the battery cables are loose or the connections come off, electrical flow is going to be interrupted. Corrosion can cause the same situation. Thankfully, these problems can be easy to repair. 4. Malfunctioning Battery Current SensorSome car models are equipped with a sensor that measures the flow and voltage to the battery. If the sensor discovers that the flow has dropped below 12.4 volts, it will tell the computer to turn on the light and ration power. However, the battery sensor can also malfunction. If the computer can?t understand the messages coming from the battery sensor, the warning light might come on as a precaution. "
How To Fix The Battery Saver Active Message?	"To fix the active battery saver message, you need to make sure that the battery connections are good and there is no corrosion.

You can take the alternator to a local auto parts store for testing or do it yourself. Here are some steps to follow.Turn all of the electrical accessories off in your car. Turn off the ignition.Set your multimeter to 15-20V DC.Connect the black lead to the negative terminal on the battery.Connect the red lead to the positive terminal on the battery.Good battery voltage won?t drop below 12.1V. With the connections still attached, start the engine. The voltage of the battery should rise dramatically. It should now read between 13.5 and 14.5V.If it?s lower than this, the alternator might be undercharging the battery.If the value is higher, it could be overcharging, which is also a defect.You can also test the system with a load. Turn on the radio, air conditioning, headlights and taillights. Even with all of these components on, the voltage shouldn?t drop lower than 13V. You may spend between $75 and $450 to get a new alternator. If you can?t put it on yourself, you also need to pay for the labor charges. 3. Replace Dead BatteryIf the battery is dead, you will need to replace it. Most car batteries last around four to six years, so if it?s been a while since you got a new one, now might be the right time. You can test the battery yourself or take it to a local auto parts store. Here are the steps to check your car battery. Turn all of the electrical accessories off in your car. Turn off the ignition.Set your multimeter to 20V DC.Connect the black lead to the negative terminal on the battery.Connect the red lead to the positive terminal on the battery.Good battery voltage won?t drop below 12.1V.

If you know it?s been a very long time since the auxiliary battery was replaced in your Mercedes, you may want to replace it even if it isn?t causing the problem right now.After reading this blog post, you should now be aware of the auxiliary battery and why you should not ignore the problem. You should always make sure to check both your batteries regularly and replace them when necessary to avoid issues."
What Does The Toyota Maintenance Required Light Mean?	"The Toyota Maintenance Required Light shows up on the dashboard as MAINT REQD. It?s set to come on at regular intervals to remind you that it?s time for service. It will remain on until the light is reset, indicating that it?s time to reset the 5,000-mile interval. When this light comes on, it indicates that service is necessary. However, the light doesn?t know if service has already been provided. All it knows is that it?s been 5,000 miles or 6 months (or since the last time the light was reset). Most car models have Toyota?s maintenance requirements set at 5,000 miles or 6 months from the factory, but this can vary slightly depending on the car model and whether it has been modified after the factory. If you have a newer Toyota model, you can check it on Toyota?s website."
What Causes The Toyota Maintenance Required Light?	"The reason why the Toyota Maintenance Required Light shows up is that it indicates it?s time for a service. Once the odometer on your vehicle counts down another 5,000 miles, the Toyota Maintenance Required Light comes on automatically.It?s possible that the service has already been provided and the light remains on. This problem indicates that the service light hasn?t been reset, so it?s not counting down another 5,000 miles yet."
How to Fix the Toyota Maintenance Required Light?	"If you haven?t had the Toyota serviced, you want to proceed with the 5,000-mile appointment. During this service, the light will be reset by the technician. If you perform the service yourself, make sure you reset the light when you are finished. If the service has been provided and you are ready to start the countdown again, you need to reset the light. This procedure is simple and discussed in detail down below. Toyota 5,000-Mile Maintenance Schedule1. Oil and Filter ChangeThe most basic aspect of the 5,000-mile service is the oil and filter change. If you are running conventional oil in your Toyota, you want to have it changed every 5,000 miles. During this time, all of the old oil is removed and new oil is added. Plus, the oil filter should be changed at the same time to ensure there are no remaining contaminants in the system. 2. Tire Inspection/RotationThe tires are the next part to be inspected. The air pressures will be checked and adjusted as needed. If the tire tread is worn excessively, the tires might need to be replaced. Additionally, a tire rotation can add more life to the tread. 3. Fluid CheckTechnicians will check all of the fluids to ensure there are no leaks worth worrying about. Fluids include transmission fluid, antifreeze, brake fluid, power steering fluid and windshield washer fluid.If the systems are low, they will be topped off. Additionally, any low fluid level might indicate a leak, so the technician will look it over to determine if there?s a problem. 4. Quick InspectionEvery other major system should be quickly checked over for integrity. For starters, the car battery should be checked to ensure it won?t leave you stranded.The brake system will also be looked at. Beyond that, lights, accessories and electrical components will be turned on to guarantee everything?s working. 5. Further ServicesWhile you are performing regular service, there will be some additional services at higher intervals. On top of the 5,000-mile service, you can also expect a cabin filter replacement and suspension system check every 15,000 miles.Beyond that, the 30,000-mile service includes a new engine air filter. As the odometer reaches mileage higher than this, you can expect the services to include more parts and come with a higher cost. "
How to Reset the Toyota Maintenance Required Light?	"To reset the maintenance required light in most Toyota cars, you should put the key in the ignition and turn it to position one. Press and hold the trip meter button and turn the ignition to position two. Hold the trip meter button for 10 seconds until you hear a beep. Turn off the ignition.Here is some more detailed information on how to reset the Toyota maintenance required light.1. Check Owner?s ManualWhile most Toyota models have a Maintenance Required Light, not all of them use the same procedures to reset the light. For this reason, it?s best to read the owner?s manual or service guide to determine the right steps for your vehicle type.If you don?t have the manual, you may also find instructions online based on what model you drive. Otherwise, you can follow our basic steps that work with most Toyota models. 2. Turn ON the VehicleYou can?t perform a reset unless the vehicle is on, but you don?t want the engine running yet. Instead, just turn the key until it sits at the Accessory position.Everything should be powered up on the car, so you can see the dashboard lit up. At first, the odometer should reveal the miles, not a trip meter.3. Hold Trip Meter Reset ButtonActivate the trip meter on the dashboard. Once that?s displayed, hold the reset button while you switch the ignition to the ON position.Hold that button for another ten seconds. You should see the light flash and/or there should be a beeping sound. Once that occurs, the light should turn itself off. 4. Start VehicleOnce the light has turned off, you are ready to start the vehicle. Let go of the reset button and start the engine. Give the dashboard time to run through the startup cycle. The light should be turned off once it?s done. If not, you can turn the engine off and try once again. However, if it doesn?t work after two cycles, you are going to need further guidance. 5. Visit Service Center for More HelpIf the service light doesn?t go out after your diligent efforts, you may need to reach out to a local mechanic. First, make sure you are following the proper procedure for your vehicle type. If you are, there could be a larger problem at hand.It might be best to visit a local Toyota dealership, although this option can cost more. Some independent mechanics have enough experience to get to the bottom of the problem, so shop around. "
Can I Drive with the Toyota Maintenance Required Light On?	"The Toyota Maintenance Required Light doesn?t indicate any type of mechanical failure. It?s simply a reminder that service is needed. For this reason, you could easily continue driving your vehicle without any trouble. However, there are some downsides to this.First, driving with the dashboard light on can be distracting. It could become annoying and make you dread driving your car.On top of that, if the light doesn?t get reset, it could become easy to neglect regular service. Without the reminder turning on at appropriate intervals, you could forget to perform an oil change or tire inspection when it?s due. For these reasons, we recommend resetting the light every time the 5,000-mile service is performed."
What Does The Maint Reqd Light Mean?	The Maint Reqd light is short for Maintenance Required on Toyota vehicles. The Maint Reqd light basically means it?s time for a service appointment. It is usually a minor type of service with an engine oil change and a basic check.
Is the maintenance required light the same as the check engine?	"No, the maintenance required light does not indicate that there is something wrong with your car, like the check engine light does. The maintenance required light only comes on to tell you it?s time for a scheduled service appointment."
Does maintenance required mean you need an oil change?	"Yes, when the service due light comes on, it means it?s time for an oil change, if it was reset at the right time at the last service. Check your service history to determine when the engine oil was last changed and change if necessary."
How long do you have after maintenance required light?	"On most Toyota models, you have 5,000 miles or 6 months until you will see the maintenance required light on the dashboard again. However, this depends on which model you have and where you live. Check your owner?s or service manual for the correct service schedule."
Conclusion	"The Toyota Maintenance Required light is not a warning system that indicates a problem with the car, but it comes on when the engine oil needs to be changed or when another scheduled service is needed.Doing an oil change and performing the maintenance required light reset yourself is often quite simple, but if you?re not comfortable doing any of these repairs yourself, take it to a mechanic. They will be able to help diagnose and fix the problem quickly and easily."
What does the EPC Light mean?	"The EPC light is a warning light that indicates a problem with your vehicle?s electronic power control (EPC) system. When this light comes on, it usually means there is an issue with the car?s throttle system.The EPC light often shows up together with the Engine, ABS, or ESP Light, depending on where the problem is. The Electronic Power Control system is monitored by the engine control unit, brake control unit, transmission control unit, and steering control unit.The EPC system is Volkswagen Group?s traction control system, and therefore you will also find the EPC system in Audi, Skoda and Seat car models."
What Causes An EPC Light?	"The most common causes of an EPC light are a faulty throttle body, a faulty ABS sensor, a cracked ABS ring, a bad brake pressure sensor, or a faulty brake pedal switch. It can also be caused by wiring issues or other electrical issues.Here are a few of the issues that could trigger the EPC light:1. Throttle body failureThrottle Body CloseThe throttle body controls how much air should enter the engine when you press the gas pedal. The EPC system uses the throttle body to control the engine power, and if there is an issue with the throttle body, the EPC system will not be able to function properly.Most throttle bodies today are electric, and if there is a problem with it, it will light up a check engine light and an EPC light on your dashboard.2. Failed Brake Pedal SwitchBrake Light SwitchThe brake pedal switch or brake light switch is used to know when you press the brake pedal, so the car should activate the brake lights. The switch is also used for other functions such as the cruise control system or the EPC system.If there is a problem with the brake pedal switch, the EPC system will not be able to recognize when you press the brake pedal or not, and therefore it will illuminate the EPC light and store a fault code.3. Bad ABS sensorAbs Sensor In HandThe ABS sensors measure the speed of each wheel on your car. It uses this information mainly for the ABS system, but there are other systems that use this information and the EPC system is one of them.The ABS sensors are located on the wheel hubs and are very exposed to dirt, rust, and water, and are therefore prone to failure. It can also be an issue with the ABS reluctor ring, from which the ABS sensor is measuring the speed from.4. Failed brake pressure sensorAbs Control Module (2)If you have a Volkswagen car and an EPC light on your dashboard, there is a high risk that the brake pressure sensor has failed. The brake pressure sensor works like the brake light switch, but it doesn?t just measure ON/OFF, it actually measures the brake pressure you apply through the brake pedal.Unfortunately, the brake pressure sensor on many VW models is located inside the ABS control module, making it quite difficult to replace. Often you need to replace the entire ABS control module if there is a problem with the sensor, which can be very expensive.5. A bad steering angle sensorSteering Angle Sensor LocationThe steering angle sensor sits behind your steering wheel and is used to measure which position the steering wheel is in. The EPC system will use this information to determine which direction you turn the steering wheel and correct the brake force with this information.To be able to turn the steering wheel, there is also a clock spring where the wires to the steering wheel angle sensor and the steering wheel buttons go. This clock spring is known to fail, and if it fails, it may look like a problem with the steering angle sensor.6. A Bad Engine SensorCar Engine SensorsThe EPC system uses a lot of different engine sensors to function properly, and if there is an issue with one of the engine sensors, it could result in an EPC light on your dashboard. It is therefore important to read the trouble codes when you see the EPC light to be able to pinpoint where the problem is.Some of the engine sensors that can trigger the EPC light are the MAF sensor, the IAT sensor, the ECT sensor, or the O2 sensor. Keep reading to find out how to determine which of these sensors is causing the EPC light.7. Wiring IssuesBroken WiringsBecause of all the electronic wiring in modern cars, there is a high risk that there is a wiring problem that is causing the EPC light. Unfortunately, wiring problems can be quite difficult to find unless you know exactly what you?re looking for.The most common wiring problems are broken wires, corroded electrical contacts, or burnt contacts. If you?ve tried everything else on this list and don?t have the knowledge to diagnose the wiring, you may need to hire a professional."
How to fix the EPC light?	"To fix the VW EPC light, you need to read the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner. Once you know what the trouble codes are telling you, you need to continue to troubleshoot these codes. Just guessing the problem will only waste your money.Here is more information about the steps you should take to fix your EPC light:1. Check Trouble CodesThe first thing you should do when you have an EPC light on your dashboard is to read the trouble codes from the engine control module and ABS control module with an OBD2 scanner. When the EPC warning light is on, it means there are one or several trouble codes stored in one of these control units.Modern car models have advanced on-board diagnostic systems, and if there is a warning light on your dashboard, it means that there is a fault code stored in one of the control modules. Instead of just guessing and replacing the wrong parts, you can save time and money by reading these error codes.You have to scan the engine control unit, ABS control unit, steering control unit, and transmission control unit for any stored trouble codes. You can either take your car to a mechanic to let them read the trouble codes, or you can do it at home with your own OBD2 scanner.However, the cheapest diagnostic scanners can only read the engine control module, and because this issue could appear in other control modules as well, it?s recommended to either get a more advanced diagnostic scanner or let a workshop read the other control units? codes.2. Check the brake light switchThe brake light switch is a common reason for the EPC light to come on, and it?s often quite easy to check. Just have someone press the brake pedal while you check the brake lights on your car. If there are no brake lights, the risk is high that the brake light switch is bad.But in many car models, there are two different currents in the brake light switch, so even if the brake lights work, there is a chance that the switch is still bad. Therefore, it is better to diagnose it with a scan tool.3. Check sensor dataIf you have a diagnostic scanner but can?t find any good trouble codes to continue troubleshooting from, you need to check the sensor data. Check the values from the brake pressure sensor to ensure they appear realistic.You will also want to check the sensor data from all other engine sensors and sensors related to the brake and EPC system.4. Talk to a professionalEPC systems can be quite difficult to diagnose correctly without the right knowledge and tools. Therefore, if you did the basic things, but still can?t figure out what?s wrong, it may be time to contact a professional mechanic who has dealt with this problem before.Although leaving it to a mechanic can be expensive, you will likely save money over simply guessing and replacing the wrong parts. If you want to fix the EPC light, you should definitely contact a Volkswagen or Audi workshop that has dealt with these issues before.You do also want to check if there are any recalls or campaigns for your VW or Audi model."
Is it dangerous to drive with the EPC light on?	"Yes, it can be risky to drive with the EPC light on without knowing what is causing it to come on. Always fix the EPC problem as soon as possible. When the light is on, it means that there may be several restricted functions in your car.Because the EPC system is integrated with the engine, steering, and brake system, it could cause engine damage or even cause a serious accident because of limited brake or steering functions. Therefore, when the EPC light appears on your dashboard, drive to the nearest mechanic repair shop as soon as possible.Usually, the EPC system issue won?t cause damage to your car if you drive carefully, but the issue could be more severe in some cases, and therefore it?s best to check it up as soon as possible."
What does the EPC Light mean on a Volkswagen or Audi?	"The EPC warning light on your Volkswagen or Audi means there is a problem with the EPC (Electric Power Control) system. The EPC system controls the throttle control, including the throttle body, accelerator pedal, cruise control, or traction control."
Can a misfire cause an EPC light?	"Yes, a misfire can cause the EPC light to come on indirectly. If the engine misfires, it will interfere with the engine?s performance, and in most cases, the check engine light will also come on. If there is a problem with the engine system, it can also trigger the EPC light."
Can the EPC Warning Light Cause a Loss of Power?	"Yes, the EPC warning light controls the throttle system and can cause a sudden power loss. Sometimes, you can?t rev up the engine at all when the EPC light appears."
How much does it cost to fix the EPC light?	"There is no fixed price to fix the EPC light because there are so many potential issues that could cause it. Usually, it will cost anything between $100 to $400 to fix the EPC light, but sometimes it can be more expensive."
Is the EPC light serious?	"Yes, due to the variety of issues that can cause the EPC light to come on, your EPC light could be on due to a serious issue. Therefore, it is important to diagnose what is causing the light to come on before you continue to drive."
Conclusion	"The EPC light indicates there is a malfunction in the electronic power control system. The electronic power control (EPC) system is controlled by the engine control module, and you will find this system in Volkswagen, Audi, and other VAG models.Although the EPC system seems quite simple, it is an advanced system that is integrated with many different systems, and therefore it can be quite difficult to pinpoint where the problem is.Fortunately, with the information in this article, you should be able to properly begin a real diagnosis of why there is an EPC light on your dashboard and get rid of it without wasting your money. I hope this information helps you"
What is the Service AdvanceTrac Warning Light?	"The Service AdvanceTrac warning light indicates that there is an issue with the AdvanceTrac system. AdvanceTrac is only found in the Ford lineup of vehicles. It?s the company?s name for the electronic stability control system.This stability control system relies on steering inputs, wheel speed sensors and other technology to determine the car?s path versus the intentions of the driver. If needed, it can provide gentle correction that helps to avoid sliding and skidding, ensuring control is over maintained of the vehicleAs an example, if you are driving with the steering wheel to the left, but the car keeps moving in a straight line, the AdvanceTrac system can gently apply the brakes and reduce torque to correct the path. It?s a beneficial component when driving on slippery roads and during bad weather. "
what are the Causes Service AdvanceTrac Warning Light ?	"The most common cause of a Service AdvanceTrac warning light is a faulty wheel speed sensor or mismatched wheels. It could also be a problem with the steering angle sensor, clock spring or the engine control system.Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of a Service AdvanceTrac warning light:1. Failed Wheel Speed SensorThe wheel speed sensor is placed on each wheel hub. These sensors are meant to monitor the speed of each wheel, ensuring that each tire is spinning at the rate it should. The information is sent to the ECU, where the data is used to determine what adjustments need to be made. If a wheel sensor fails, the data won?t make it to the ECU. Therefore, the AdvanceTrac system can?t make the necessary adjustments and the warning light shows up on the dashboard. 2. Mismatched Tires/WheelsIf you alter the wheel or tire size, you could throw off the specification of the AdvanceTrac system. This is most noticeable if you decide to mismatch the tires or wheels. If the sensor determines that a value is out of the usual parameters, a code in the system could be set. Until changes are made, the AdvanceTrac system may not work as it was designed. 3. Malfunctioning Steering Angle Sensor or Clock SpringThe clock spring is made up of wire coils that run to the steering angle sensor. It?s also connected to the airbag and steering wheel controls. If the clock spring breaks, the signal running from the steering angle sensor to the ECU can be disrupted. Without this connection, the AdvanceTrac system becomes inoperable. You may also see an airbag warning light and have trouble using the steering wheel controls. It is also possible that the steering angle sensor itself is the issue and not the clock spring.4. Bad Engine SensorThe AdvanceTrac system works in conjunction with the engine control module and if there is anything wrong with the engine?s performance, it can also cause a Service AdvanceTrac warning light.A faulty MAP or boost pressure sensor is a common cause on some Ford vehicles that will cause this warning light to turn on.5. Corroded Battery TerminalAnother common problem on Ford vehicles that will cause the Service AdvanceTrac warning light is corroded battery terminal wires.Carefully check and pull all wires connected to the positive terminal to make sure there are no loose wires there due to corrosion or rust.6. Blown FuseEverything electrical in a vehicle runs through the fuses. There?s a fuse for every electrical function needed by the vehicle. If the fuse blows, the signal will be interrupted with the AdvanceTrac system, leading to further problems. If the fuse is replaced and continues to blow, there could be a larger electrical system issue.In many Ford vehicles, you will find a fuse located on the positive battery terminal that will blow and can cause the Service AdvanceTrac warning light to illuminate.7. Electrical Wiring DefectThe most common electrical defect with AdvanceTrac systems is a problem with the ground connection. The bad ground will also lead to other electrical malfunctions since all of the sensors rely on it.However, any electrical connection could be to blame. It could be damaged wiring, a corroded connection or simply a crimped wire leading to your trouble. 8. Low Brake FluidThe brake fluid level must remain full to keep the system running at its best. If the level drops, it can reduce braking ability, putting you in danger on the road.It can also affect the AdvanceTrac system and ABS since the brakes are used with both systems. In some cases, this low fluid level is due to a leak that must first be corrected. 9. Limp ModeWhen the vehicle faces a major malfunction, it will go into limp mode. During this limp mode, any system that isn?t vital will be shut down to ensure the vehicle remains protected.In most cases, the limp mode will shut down the AdvanceTrac system temporarily, which can also cause the warning light to come on. With this condition, it?s unlikely that the AdvanceTrac system is to blame and it will be re-engaged once you determine what?s causing the failure. "
Service AdvanceTrac Warning Light Fixes ?	"1. Use Code ScannerOnce you see any warning light on the dashboard, it?s imperative to see what?s going on by using your OBD-II code scanner. Not every scanner is capable of reading these messages, so you will need a higher-end model to move on. However, these devices are a must-have if you want to do your own work.Scan the system to see what errors are showing. If there are a lot of codes present, you can clear the codes and take a drive until the warning comes back on. This simple step ensures that only the most recent codes are looked at.Once you see the codes, you can research the problem to determine the appropriate fix. Whether you need a new wheel sensor, clock spring or other component, it?s imperative that the problem gets repaired to ensure AdvanceTrac working again. 2. Check Brake FluidIf the code doesn?t narrow down the problem, you should look closely at the brake fluid level. If it?s not filled to the appropriate line, you want to fill it up. Make sure you use the right fluid for your vehicle.If the fluid continues to run low, you need to find the leak that?s causing the problem. Fix the leak to ensure proper brake and AdvanceTrac operation. 3. Inspect Electrical Wiring/ConnectionsIf your diagnosis is leading you to the electrical system, start with the fuses. Find the appropriate fuse and determine if it is still working correctly. If it?s blown, replace it with a comparable fuse to fix the problem.When the fuse isn?t to blame, any other wiring or connector could be to blame. Start by examining the ground connection. There must be a clean connection to ensure proper conductivity. If you have other sensors causing problems, you might be able to better figure out where the fault is. It?s helpful to have a wiring diagram for your vehicle to track down what?s happening. Otherwise, you could get lost in all the wiring and connectors. 4. Visit a Professional MechanicAll of the steps above are aspects that can be handled by most well-versed home mechanics. If these repairs and diagnostic steps don?t help you resolve the problem, you might find yourself in need of more support. Don?t be afraid to reach out to a local repair shop if you are stumped. After all, you can?t have knowledge about every fault, nor do you have all of the professional equipment needed to repair the bigger problems. Sometimes, it makes more sense to pay a little extra and get the job done right. "
Cost to Repair Service AdvanceTrac Warning Light ?	"The average cost you incur from fixing this warning light depends on what needs to be repaired. In some cases, you are looking at a minimal amount of money, especially if you only need a new fuse or some extra fluid is required. On the other hand, some of the repairs can be more expensive. For example, a clock spring could easily cost $775 or more on some vehicles, while electrical malfunctions can raise the repair costs if many hours of labor are needed to pinpoint the issue. "
Should I Drive with the Service AdvanceTrac Warning Light On?	"The car should continue running with the Service AdvanceTrac warning light on unless the car is in limp mode due to an engine issue. You could easily continue driving, and you may not notice any other issues during that time. In fact, if the weather is clear and the roads are dry, the drive might seem completely normal to you, causing you to wonder if you need anything fixed at all.While it can be tempting to put off the repair, you will start to notice trouble when the weather turns bad or you hit slippery surfaces. You don?t want to be put in a dangerous situation, which is why we always recommend getting a repair as soon as you can.Also, if the warning light is caused by a bad engine sensor, it can lead to more issue if you don?t repair the cause."
What?s the difference between traction control and AdvanceTrac?	Traction control ensures that your car does not lose traction between your car?s tires and the road. The AdvanceTrac system is a stability system that prevents your car from skidding or skidding on the road at higher speeds.
Should Advancetrac be on or off?	The AdvanceTrac system should be on in most cases and for most drivers. The only time you would want to turn off the AdvanceTrac system is if you are stuck in mud or snow. This will prevent the system from removing power from the wheels.
What is the AdvanceTrac on a Ford?  	"AdvanceTrac is an electronic stability control system that is available on most Ford cars. It helps to prevent the wheels from slipping and losing traction, which can cause the vehicle to skid or spin out of control. The system uses sensors to monitor the driver?s inputs and the vehicle?s motion and then intervenes with braking and engine power to help keep the vehicle on course."
How do I turn off AdvanceTrac?	"To turn off the AdvanceTrac system, you need to find the AdvanceTrac / Stability Control button in your car. Start the engine and hold the button for 5 to 10 seconds until the indicator light comes on."
What is the Honda FCW System?	"The FCW system is Honda?s forward-collision warning system. The FCW (Forward-Collision Warning) system utilizes sensors to determine if a collision is about to occur. These sensors can be a combination of cameras, lasers and radars. Once the system detects that a collision is imminent, it sends an alert to the driver to avoid the collision.This alert could be an alarm, vibration of the wheel, or a visual warning. If the driver is not reacting to the message, the car can brake automatically, depending on the car model.With this warning, the driver should be able to react and avoid an accident. However, there are times when the system needs to help the driver by providing gentle steering motions or braking to reduce speed. "
What does the FCW System Failed message mean?	"The ?FCW System Failed? message means the forward-collision warning system has failed in your vehicle. The FCW System is an essential safety feature meant to notify you when a collision is imminent. If the system fails, you won?t be notified of a possible collision.Honda Accord and Honda Odyssey are two common Honda models that often suffer from the FCW System Failed message. If the FCW System Failed message occurs, it can be alarming. However, there are several instances where repair is easy."
what are the Causes of FCW Sensor Failure ?	"1. Bad WeatherSnow Radar SensorOne of the main reasons that the FCW system fails is because of bad weather. If you are driving in extreme rain or snow, the system might misinterpret this as a possible collision and malfunction as a result.In this case, the only solution is to pull over and wait for the weather to pass. We recommend turning off the engine for a few minutes to let the system reset. 2. Dirty Sensor or CameraIf you have driven on a muddy road or haven?t washed your car for a long time, it can cause the FCW system to fail. If the camera or radar sensor is covered in dirt or mud, it will not work properly and you will see this error on your dashboard.Clean your car or the area in front of the camera or radar sensor.3. Normal WearAs with any car part, these sensors can wear down over time. That?s why it?s important to have the vehicle regularly inspected and looked at.Maybe you can?t see any major damage to the sensors, but they still need to be replaced. Someone qualified to work with these advanced safety systems will know what?s going on.4. Defective Sensor or CameraCar Radar SensorIt?s possible for the sensors or camera to fail prematurely or for no reason at all. Even if you have taken care of your vehicle, the sensor can die and malfunction all on its own.If the sensor or camera detects collisions that aren?t there, or it fails and sends you a dashboard message, you want to have it looked at. The only way to remain safe is to fix it promptly.5. Software MalfunctionSometimes it?s not the sensor that has failed, but the software running it. There is software installed to run the FCW system that is prone to failure.Some automakers can provide an update to correct the situation. Otherwise, it will need to be reprogrammed. 6. DamageThe FCW system can fail if damage has occurred. If you?ve been in an accident, the sensors might have sustained damage that renders them inoperable.It?s important to have the vehicle looked at after any collision, no matter how small it is. Once you get the okay from a mechanic, you are good to go again. "
Where is the FCW Sensor Found?	"Each make and model has FCW sensors in various places. In most cases, you can find the sensors in the front of the vehicle, since this is where collisions occur.The sensors can be found near the headlights or in the grille. If cameras are involved in the system, these might be on or near the windshield. You can get more information from the owner?s manual. "
Can I Drive with the FCW System Failed Message?	"We?ve discussed how important the FCW system is to your on-road safety. If it fails, you are putting yourself and your occupants in danger. You won?t be alerted if there?s a possible collision up ahead, leaving you on your own to navigate the road.While you can drive without the FCW system working, it?s best not to. We prefer that you have it repaired right away to ensure the safety of everyone around you. However, we also understand that you might need to drive a little bit to get to the service center. During this time, take your time and be extremely cautious since you are driving unprotected. "
how to Reset/Recalibrate Honda FCW System ?	"Reset FCW SystemTo reset the advanced safety system, you will need the help of a professional that has high-tech scanners. Most code scanners aren?t able to reset the system and it can?t be done from the vehicle itself.The mechanic will use their calibrated tools to turn off the warning light. Once the problem is resolved, the light shouldn?t come back on.Some people recommend resetting the ECU to reset the system on its own. This would be done by disconnecting the battery for thirty minutes. However, we don?t recommend this method because of the inconvenience it can cause with other systems in your vehicle.Recalibrate FCW SystemIf you?ve had your windshield replaced or a front body part put on, you might need to have the FCW system camera recalibrated. With the help of dynamic or static camera aiming, the system will be good to go once again. This aiming process is done at a professional shop only.The cameras must be aimed at specific targets according to the factory specifications in the service manual. The auto repair shop will put on the parking brake and turn off both the DRLs and headlights before starting. It must also be done in a garage where natural light sources aren?t interfering. "
Cost to Fix FCW System Failure ?	"The cost to repair the FCW system failure depends on what needs to be done. If the sensor simply needs to be cleaned off, you may only spend $75 or so. On the other hand, major failures could quickly add up to $1,500 or more. This isn?t a cheap system to work with.Not only does it matter what has caused the problem, but your make and model of the vehicle will also influence the price. A cheap, economical car might not cost as much to repair as a luxury model. Plus, some luxury brands require special mechanics to work on these systems. You would have to visit a particular dealership or another repair shop that is certified to work on your vehicle type.In some cases, you might be able to perform the repair on your own if you have the right equipment. However, the scanner needed to recalibrate or reset the system is expensive and not something most home mechanics have. For this reason, it might be better to bite the bullet and visit your local repair shop instead."
Why is my FCW light on?	"If your FCW warning light is on, it means there is a problem with your forward collision warning system. To find out what is causing the warning light, you need to scan the trouble codes with a code scanner and continue troubleshooting from there."
Where is the FCW sensor located?	"The FCW sensor is either a camera placed on top of the car?s windshield, or a radar sensor placed behind the lower grille in the front of the car. It depends on the car model you drive and the type of FCW system your car uses."
Can you turn off the FCW System?	"Yes. You can turn off the FCW (forward collision warning) system if you?d like. To do so, simply press and hold the FCW OFF button located on the instrument panel for two seconds. If you can?t find the button, check your owner?s manual. Please note that while the FCW system is turned off, you will not receive any visual or audible warnings if someone or something is in front of your vehicle."
Which car models use the FCW System?	"There are many car brands with different types of radar collision systems, but the FCW (Forward-Collision Warning) System is Honda?s system. This means you will find the FCW system in most modern Honda vehicles and you can also find it in other brands that use Honda?s system."
What Does the ?Check Fuel Fill Inlet? Message Mean?	The dashboard warning message indicating ?Check Fuel Fill Inlet? means that something is wrong with the evaporative emissions control system (EVAP) that is causing a leak. It could be something as simple as a loose gas cap or contamination that needs to be cleaned.The Evaporative Emission Control System (EVAP) prevents gas vapors from escaping from the fuel tank. These systems have been required on all gasoline-powered vehicles since back in the 1970s and are made from several components that work together in harmony.
What is Fuel Fill Inlet?	"The fuel fill inlet is where the fuel gets fed into the gas tank. It is topped with a gas cap that covers the inlet. With most cars, this inlet is determined by both the gas cap and the tube leading into the tank. Without this inlet, you wouldn?t be able to get fuel into the tank so it could run."
Reasons for Check Fuel Fill Inlet Warning ?	"1. Fuel Cap MissingIf you fail to put the fuel cap back on the tank, you will probably see the Check Engine Light come on. It can also cause the ?Check Fuel Fill Inlet? message on the dashboard. Because of the modern sensors on today?s cars, you can expect to see some warning if the cap is missing.Thankfully, fuel shouldn?t spill out as a result of the missing cap. Still, the system is meant to be closed and it?s not with the cap open. To fix the problem, all you need to do is put the cap back on and viola, it?s repaired. 2. Unsecured Fuel CapMaybe you put the fuel cap on, but it didn?t click all the way. In this case, you could also receive either message on the dashboard. With the cap off slightly, the pressure in the system won?t be right. Before you pull away from the gas station, ensure that the cap clicks in place so you know it?s properly tightened. There?s also the chance that the cap is loose because of damage. If you can?t get it to click, you might need to replace it with a new one. Any damage to the gas cap should be taken seriously. With the low price of a new cap, there?s no reason to procrastinate with the fix. 3. Overtightened Fuel CapTo counteract the loose fuel cap, you might go ahead and overtighten it, but this isn?t a good idea either. The cap is fitted with silicone material and rubber gaskets to ensure a proper seal.When you tighten it too hard, these parts can break or fail. Any damage to the sealing function can lead to vapors escaping, which causes the warning light to come on. To repair it, you?ll still need a new gas cap. 4. Dirt ContaminationEven if you are diligent about cleaning your car and keeping it in good condition, there?s probably one area you neglect. The fuel filler neck is the opening where you fill-up the gas tank. It?s a spot that seems to collect dirt quite easily but never seems to get cleaned out. If the fuel filler neck or inlet becomes contaminated, it can stop the cap from sealing and lead to other malfunctions. As the buildup becomes worse, you could also see the Check Fuel Fill Inlet warning. Beyond that, dirt that?s allowed to sit on the components can eventually lead to breakdown or corrosion of the parts. Do yourself a favor and clean the area out with a rag when you are washing your car. 6. Evaporative Emission Control System (EVAP) LeakIf there?s a leak in the EVAP system, you may see both the Check Engine Light and the Check Fuel Fill Inlet message. To determine what?s going on, you want to use your code scanner for better insight. Trouble codes P0455 and P0456 both indicate a sign of an EVAP leak. However, these leaks can be caused by something as small as a contaminated or broken gas cap, as we mentioned above. Still, you don?t want to overlook the chances of a broken EVAP system component. In general, an EVAP leak isn?t going to lead to major trouble with the car, but you should still take it seriously. Not only is the car pumping out gases that hurt the environment, but you can also fail an emissions test until you have it fixed. The best way to find an EVAP leak is to use an EVAP smoke machine."
How to fix ?Check Fuel Fill Inlet? on Ford ?	"While you can find the ?Check Fuel Fill Inlet? message on some different car brands, the most common car model you will find it on is Ford vehicles. There is also a reason why you will find it on these models, and that?s because of the capless gas tank that these car models often use.Instead of a normal gas cap that you remove before refilling fuel, these cars have a flap valve that seals the gas tank instead of the standard gas tank. Unfortunately, if this flap valve gets dirty or worn, it won?t seal properly, and you will see the check fuel fill inlet message on your dashboard.Some of the affected models are:Ford F150Ford EdgeFord FusionFord EscapeFord ExplorerFord MustangYou may find this message on more Ford models, but these are the most common.If you have a Ford vehicle with a capless gas tank and see the ?Check fuel fill inlet? message on your dashboard, you need to clean and lubricate the gas tank flap.Look at the gas tank flap and press it with a screwdriver or something similar. Be careful so that you don?t drop it into the gas tank. Clean the sealings from any dirt around the sealing area and spray some lubricant. Open and close the flap a couple of times. By doing this, you can often get the flap to seal better, and that may be enough to fix the message."
Cost to Repair Check Fuel Fill Inlet Message ?	"The cost you encounter to repair the Check Fuel Fill Inlet message could be anywhere from $5 to $1,000+. It?s difficult to estimate what you are up against because a complete diagnosis is needed first.Obviously, if there?s a problem with the gas cap, this will be your least expensive repair. Even if the cap is simply dirty, you are looking at a fix that?s essentially free.On the other hand, if you have a vacuum leak to deal with, you could spend a lot of money between diagnosing and repairing it, especially if you need help from a certified mechanic. For this reason, we encourage you to do your research ahead of time to determine what?s causing the problem. If it?s something you feel confident repairing on your own, you might as well save the labor cost. "
Can I Drive With A Check Fuel Fill Inlet Message?	"Most of the problems that cause this message to come on aren?t severe. For this reason, you don?t have to stop driving immediately. However, you should always have faults looked at and repaired as soon as possible to ensure the rest of the car continues running as intended. What?s more alarming is what could happen while these messages remain on the dashboard. If another component were to fail while the Check Engine Light was on, you wouldn?t know what?s happening. Something major could happen and you would keep driving, which isn?t wise. For this reason alone, we recommend resolving the issue and getting the warning lights off of your dash, so you can remain informed."
Why do new cars have no gas cap?	"The idea behind a capless fuel system is that it makes refueling your car faster and less messy. The fuel goes into a sealed tank with a valve that only opens when the nozzle from the pump is inserted. This helps to prevent the evaporation of gas fumes, which can pollute the environment. However, these capless gas tank inlets do unfortunately sometimes fail."
Can I put a cap on a capless gas tank inlet?	"It depends on the car model, but you can actually find aftermarket gas caps that will fit the capless gas tank inlet on your car model. You can also make one yourself, but it may require some basic skills, and it is much easier to buy one that is custom made for your car model."
How do I reset the check fuel fill inlet message?	"The easiest way to reset a fuel check message is to use an OBD2 scanner. Just connect the scanner and clear the error code memory. But if you didn?t fix the problem that caused the message in the first place, the warning light will return sooner or later. Depending on the car model, it can also reset by itself if you solve the issue and let the car make a couple of successful test cycles, but it may take a while."
What is the Transmission Warning Light?	"When the transmission warning light is activated, it indicates that there is an issue with the transmission or gearbox. Not every vehicle contains a transmission warning light. If your car has one of these lights, it could look different depending on the make and model you drive.It might be a thermometer surrounded by a gear symbol or there could be a text string alerting you to the trouble.You can find details on your particular model in the owner?s manual. Either way, if an alert comes on the dashboard related to the transmission, it indicates that a fault has been noticed that should be investigated right away. "
How to Fix the Transmission Warning Light ?	"1. Stop DrivingAs with the Check Engine Light, you should always pay attention to the transmission warning light. When the light comes on, it?s always best to stop driving and get a better feel for what?s happening before continuing.Even if you don?t notice any signs of something wrong, you want to perform a complete inspection. Otherwise, permanent transmission damage could occur. As an example, if the system lacks fluid and you continue driving, you may end up needing a whole new transmission. Instead, you could have just added some fluid and been done. 2. Scan Trouble CodesWith your compatible OBD-II code scanner, you can see what alerts are set in the system. Plug your code scanner into the OBD-II port and read the DTCs to see what?s going on.If there are too many codes to navigate through, it?s best to reset the light and take the car for a test drive. After a few minutes, the light should come back on, allowing you to retrieve just the relevant codes to the current problem.3. Go to a Professional MechanicIf the codes don?t provide you with the information you need to repair the problem, it?s best to talk to a mechanic. When you call, you should be prepared to explain anything unusual you see going on along with the trouble codes.In some cases, it?s best to visit a shop that deals specifically with the transmission. This would be ideal if you are concerned that there?s a major issue that might require a transmission rebuild or replacement. "
what are the Causes of the Transmission Warning Light ?	"1. Low Transmission FluidWhen the transmission fluid drops too low, the alert might go off to prevent damage. Additionally, the transmission might not operate normally when the levels are low. Your car shouldn?t be burning through transmission fluid as it might oil. For this reason, any drop in transmission fluid should be dealt with right away, as there is probably a leak present. 2. Overheating TransmissionWhether the fluid is low or there?s failure occurring internally with the transmission, if this vital component starts to overheat, the alert will come on. In some cases, an overheating transmission can be caused by a blocked cooler.The transmission can also overheat if you are carrying excessively heavy loads. Either way, it should be treated the same way that an overheated engine is. You should stop driving immediately until the transmission cools off. 3. Shift Interlock FailureIn some cases, the transmission warning light might not actually indicate failure with the part itself. It could mean that something else working with the powertrain is failing.As an example, BMW models have a shift interlock system that keeps you from shifting out of Park unless you push down the brake pedal first. If this system malfunctions, the transmission warning light could come on. 4. Malfunctioning Valve BodyThe automatic transmission and CVTs include a valve body. This vital part contains valves that are responsible for directing flow through the passages, so it gets delivered to the transmission when it?s needed.In today?s valve body, there will also be a transmission control module (TCM) that operates all of the sensors and electronics. If any of these valve body parts fail, the transmission warning light could come on. 5. Faulty Torque ConverterThe automatic transmission also contains a torque converter. This part pairs the engine to the transmission, serving as the link between the two.With excessive use or old age, the torque converter can wear out. When this happens, gear slippage and shuddering can occur. It can also come apart, leading to your transmission system being contaminated with debris. Either way, a failing torque converter is going to light up the transmission warning light. 6. Internal Transmission FailureWith so many internal parts working to keep the transmission running, it?s possible for just about anything to fail. Inside the transmission, you will find the gear sets, clutch packs and more. With any internal failure, the transmission won?t be able to run as intended. This problem causes the transmission warning light to come on. 7. Electrical/Computer MalfunctionThe modern transmission is run by many high-tech sensors and electrical connections. With the transmission control module, all of the sensors are run accurately and efficiently. However, any of these electrical connectors and sensors can fail at any time.If there?s even the smallest glitch in the system, the transmission might not be able to run properly. For this reason, damaged wiring, a failing computer and a defective solenoid can all cause the transmission warning light to come on. "
Can I Drive With the Transmission Warning Light On?	"I?ve previously discussed this, but it?s important to reiterate that you shouldn?t drive with the transmission warning light illuminated. Your car?s transmission is expensive ? one of the most valuable parts of the vehicle. For this reason, you don?t want to mess around with any faults that could lead to permanent damage. Maybe you stop driving and realize that only a minor issue is occurring, such as a small leak. In this case, you could fill up the system and keep driving while keeping a close eye on the situation. However, if the transmission is overheating or there is an internal failure, you don?t want to procrastinate in any way. Even if it?s just a leak, you could let it go temporarily, but at any moment, it could become a much bigger problem.For these reasons, it?s best to have the problems resolved immediately. You want to repair the fault and head off any potential transmission failure before it occurs. Otherwise, you could end up stranded on the side of the road, far away from your mechanic. You could also face a transmission replacement, which might cost you $1,500 to $3,500 or more."
what are the Causes of Low Tire Pressure Light is On with Correct Tire Pressure ?	"If your low tire pressure light is on even if the tire pressure is fine, you may need to reset the TPMS. It can also be due to a faulty TPMS sensor. However, the sensor battery might also be dead or the TPMS receiver could be damaged. If you have an indirect TPMS system, the problem could be due to the loss of traction. Here is some more detailed information on possible reasons why the low tire pressure light is on but the tire pressure is good.1. Faulty or Unprogrammed Tire Pressure SensorIf you corrected the tire pressure, but the TPMS light is still on, you may need to reset the TPMS system with either a scanner or check the procedure for your specific car model. Sometimes the tire pressure sensors lose the programmed data and you may need to use an OBD2 scanner or TPMS Reset tool to reprogram the TPMS sensor if everything else seems fine.The TPMS sensor can also be easily damaged, which causes the light to remain on. The problem with a faulty sensor is that it isn?t monitoring the tire pressures, putting you at risk.The sensor can be damaged due to debris or contaminants. It can also be damaged during the mounting and dismounting of the tires, as special care is needed to ensure the sensors are protected. 2. Dead Battery in SensorDirect monitoring TPMS sensors need batteries to operate correctly. These batteries are made to last a long time, but they can still fail. On average, the batteries might fail every five to ten years. If the battery dies, there can?t be any feedback through the system. This breakdown in communication causes the light to come on. 3. Defective TPMS ReceiverThis issue isn?t as common as the other two, but it can happen. The receiver of the TPMS can fail, leading to a loss of pressure data from the tires. There?s no rhyme or reason as to why this happens occasionally, other than it?s electronic equipment that can be fallible. It won?t matter what pressure is in each tire, the TPMS light will come on. 4. Traction LossIf your car uses an indirect TPMS configuration, any loss of traction could cause the light to come on. These systems use the wheel speed sensor information to tell when there?s a problem with the tire pressures.However, when traction is lost, the sensors could determine the cause is low tire pressure, even when it?s not. This problem can lead to some confusion, especially when the light comes on and off periodically. "
differnece between Understanding Direct and Indirect TPMS ?	"1. DirectThe direct TPMS is used in most cars on the road today. With this design, all four wheels have a sensor that feeds information back to the computer. If the tire pressure gets low, a signal is sent and the alert comes on the dashboard.Because of where the sensors are located, there can be damage to them when driving on harsh road conditions, such as dirt driveways or during service. They also go bad simply because of old age, requiring replacement over time.2. IndirectSome manufacturers prefer the indirect system, which doesn?t use a sensor on each wheel. Instead, the TPMS runs from the sensors on the anti-lock brakes. These sensors determine when the rotation speed is slow, indicating that tire pressure might be low.The indirect TPMS is considered more durable than the normal system because it doesn?t fail as often. However, you aren?t going to know if multiple tires are running low since there aren?t separate sensors. Up until now, it?s only been some Asian and European automakers that have chosen this TPMS configuration. However, other automakers are discussing switching over, making it more of a standard option across the board. "
How to Fix TPMS Light ?	"1. Fill Tire with AirThe most obvious solution is to fill the low tire with the right amount of air. When the light comes on, you should always start by checking the tire pressures.You can compare the reading with the recommended air pressure by looking at the driver?s side door jamb. If the light remains on despite the pressures being right, you have to move on to our other tips.2. Repair FaultThe repair you continue with depends on what is causing the fault. If you don?t have the equipment to figure out what?s wrong, you should visit a qualified mechanic.If the car needs a simple TPMS sensor, you might spend between $75 and $250 for the part and labor. In most cases, a dead battery will also require a new sensor replacement. If the receiver needs to be replaced, the price is going to be slightly more. If you have the equipment to work on these sensors and receivers, you could perform the repair yourself. By doing so, you cut out the expense of the labor charge. 3. Reset LightIf the light has come on because there was a problem after wheel rotation or another service, you may just need to reset the light. Most manufacturers have a simple way to reset the warning light. You can find it in your owner?s manual.There might be a reset button in your car?s glove compartment or in the menu of your car settings. However, you need to know how long to press the button and what steps are necessary to get the job done. "
Can I Drive with the TPMS Light On?	"You should never ignore the warning given by the TPMS light. If you notice it on the dashboard, you want to stop as soon as it?s safe to ensure that there?s enough air pressure in the tires. If the tires aren?t inflated properly, failure is imminent. The tires could overheat and blow out, leading to a dangerous situation. You also lose control as the tire pressures continue to drop. At the least, the underinflation is causing the tires to wear unevenly, leading to the need for replacement more frequently. Additionally, when the TPMS light is on with the tires perfectly inflated, you aren?t going to know when there is a problem. If a sensor is bad and you ignore it, one of the tires could become underinflated and you have no way of knowing. As the tires get lower, you start to deal with:Delayed driving responseAdditional wear to the tiresOverheating tiresReduced tractionBumpier rideLess on-road controlFor the cost of adding air or repairing the fault, it?s not worth taking the risk. You will spend a fraction to get the repair than what you might be liable for in the instance of a major accident. Plus, a significant collision could lead to a complete change in lifestyle if there are injuries. Is any of this worth ignoring the helpful TPMS light?"
How Does the Odometer Work?	"The odometer is a measurement device that shows the total distance traveled by the car. It?s found on the car?s dashboard. Two Greek words come together to form the word ?odometer,? leaving us with the meaning of path and measure.There is also a trip odometer on most cars. Unlike the standard odometer, the trip odometer is easy to reset to show how many miles were traveled during a specific time. It?s a helpful tool if you want to figure out the approximate gas mileage of your vehicle. "
How to Check the Odometer Reading ?	"Whether you have a mechanical or electronic odometer, you can read the numbers that are shown on your car?s dashboard. These numbers show how many total miles the vehicle has been driven. However, there are some ways these numbers can be messed with, giving you a false impression. Here is more detailed information on how to check your car?s odometer, depending on whether you have a mechanical or electronic odometer:1. Mechanical OdometerMechanical OdometerMechanical odometers are constructed with a few cogs. Each one represents a numerical digit. The functionality of this kind of odometer begins at the car?s transmission. There is a small gear used to change the odometer which is found attached to the transmission. The drive cable for the speedometer is connected to this gear, with the other end reaching the instrument cluster. As the car moves, the transmission gear also turns in conjunction. The drive cable connected to it changes the digits on the odometer. As can be seen by the illustration above, the counting begins on the right. This particular odometer shows 160,648 km. All of these numbers will reach a peak value before resetting to zero and starting again. However, the mechanical odometer numbers can often be slightly off-center, making them more difficult to read. 2. Electronic OdometerDigital OdometerThe electronic odometer design is newer than the mechanical type. It?s a digital odometer that is run by the electrical system. While there is still a special gear measuring the mileage, there isn?t a drive cable. Instead, a magnetic sensor is used to count how often the gear turns with the transmission. The mileage is then shown by the numbers reflected on the dashboard electronically.Electronic odometers are more accurate than mechanical ones, and they aren?t as easy to alter. If you look at the illustration above, it shows the mileage of the vehicle at 100000 km, revealed electronically."
Why is the Odometer Reading Important?	"The numbers you read on the odometer show you how many miles the vehicle has traveled. When you look at the odometer, you know how many miles are on that vehicle?s engine, transmission and other vital parts.This measurement is important to know before you purchase a vehicle, since the mileage determines a large part of the car?s value. Vehicles are often priced according to the model year, condition and mileage. The lower the mileage, the higher the resale value typically is."
How to Calculate Fuel Economy with the Odometer ?	"You can use the odometer to figure out the approximate fuel economy of your vehicle. Knowing what the car should be getting, you can determine if the engine is working as it should.When you fill-up the gas tank, reset the trip odometer.Drive normally until the next time you fill-up.At that filling session, write down the number of gallons you added and take note of the trip mileage since the last fill-up. This shows how many miles you drove for that many gallons of gas.You can divide the number of miles driven by the number of gallons you put in the tank. For example, if you drove 200 miles on 10 gallons of fuel, the average fuel economy was 20 mpg. To get the most accurate reading, try to record the mileage for an entire tank of fuel. You can also perform the test several times to see a better average. "
Can the Odometer Be Wrong?	"It?s possible for the odometer to show the wrong measurement. If you have a mechanical odometer, you want to watch it periodically to ensure it is recording the mileage correctly. If you measure the distance you?ve driven, the odometer should accurately report it. If the odometer isn?t working correctly ? even a little ? the mismeasurement can quickly add up. Let?s assume that the odometer changes too soon ? again, even by a little. It won?t take long before the car is showing far more miles than what has actually been driven, leading it to lose resale value unnecessarily. It?s possible to have the fault repaired and get back on track. If you plan to sell your car in the future, this is something you want to take care of right away."
What Does it Mean to Roll Back an Odometer?	"Dishonest people aren?t afraid to roll back the odometer to make a car look like it has fewer miles than it actually has. It is much easier to roll back a mechanical odometer. While there are some hoops to jump through to get around the security system, criminals know how to make it happen with minimal effort.It?s not impossible to roll back a digital odometer, and those who have sought out how to do it have succeeded. It is a lot harder ,because the security features are more advanced, but it?s not impossible. With either type of odometer, you must be on guard against tampering and fraud.Otherwise, you could pay more for a vehicle, assuming it?s worth a higher value than it actually is. Odometer tampering is illegal. If you realize that the odometer of a vehicle has been rolled back, you want to take legal action against the car dealer. "
How to Tell if Odometer Has Been Rolled Back ?	"Before you purchase a vehicle, you want to be sure that the odometer is accurate. The best way to do this is to run a CARFAX report on the vehicle. With this vehicle history report, you can see how many owners the car had and see the service records. With all of the reported mileage and dates, you will know very quickly if the odometer has been turned back at some point.For example, if the CARFAX shows that in 2019 the car had 156,000 miles on it, you would know something is wrong if you are looking at it in 2022 with only 125,000 miles on the odometer. This simple step indicates that the odometer has been messed with and you should avoid the car at all costs. You can also physically look at the mechanical odometer to see if anything appears shady. If you see scratches around the numbers or other imperfections, this should serve as a red flag to you. Finally, listen to your gut. If the car dealer gives you a bad feeling or doesn?t seem to care about regulations, it?s best to choose somewhere else to do business. If the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is."
What is the Gas Light on the Dashboard?	"The dashboard contains many lights that alert you to problems. When the light comes on that looks like a gas pump, this is the low fuel warning. This fuel light is controlled by electronic sensors in the fuel system that determines how much gas is left.Most systems rely on a floatation device in the tank that measures how much fuel is left. When it reaches a certain threshold at the bottom of the tank, the light comes on. As soon as you fill the fuel beyond that threshold, the gas warning light will go off."
How Many Miles Can You Drive Once the Gas Light Comes On?	"Once the gas light comes on, the tank isn?t necessarily empty. Most vehicles will travel 30 to 50 more miles once the gas light comes on before the gas tank is empty. Each vehicle can drive for a different amount of time, depending on how big the tank is and where the low fuel threshold is.Some models like Nissan Altima can travel more than 100 miles once the low fuel light comes on, but F-150 trucks are only meant to travel around 35 more miles.If you want to know exactly what your vehicle has left, you would need to look at the size of the fuel tank and figure out the threshold that activates the light. From here, you should be able to determine an approximate amount of miles you could still travel. You can find the exact distance in the owner?s manual for many car models also."
what is the Dangers of Driving with Low Fuel ?	"There is no doubt that high gas prices are annoying, but you should never drive around with low fuel level as it can get even more costly repair bills in the end. Here are a few reasons why you should refill before your gas gauge hits the bottom.1. Damaged Fuel PumpYou don?t want to deal with replacing a fuel pump because it?s not normally a simple fix. Yet, frequently driving with less than a ¬ of a tank can quickly lead to fuel pump damage, if the fuel level is low and it starts to pump air instead of fuel. So, you don?t want to make it a habit to drive until the fuel level is too low.To replace the fuel pump, you probably have to remove the gas tank. You will also need to drain the fuel, so you might prefer to take it to a shop for repairs, which is going to cost more money. 2. Excessive Engine SedimentAll gasoline has some sediment in it. This is true even if you are using top-tier fuel from the best gas stations.When the fuel levels get low, sediment make its way into the engine. Also other deposits and debris could enter the engine when the fuel level is low. This is a top contributor to permanent engine damage and would require a costly replacement to fix. 3. Clogged FiltersThat sediment that?s making its way into the engine is also getting caught in the fuel filters. While you can change the fuel filter, you don?t want to replace unnecessary parts prematurely.Once the fuel filter is clogged, you will have trouble starting the engine and will notice a decrease in acceleration. It can also cause a rough idle and misfiring. The lean fuel mixture due to lack of fuel can even damage the catalytic converter if you are very unlucky.4. Fuel Injection System CorrosionWhen the fuel levels get lower, more condensation can occur. With temperature differences and the added moisture, corrosion begins in the fuel injection system. When this occurs, the engine won?t run properly. You could be facing expensive repairs that would have been easily avoided."
Tips to Conserve Gas ?	"1. Drive CarefullyIf you are braking erratically or accelerating rapidly, you are wasting fuel. In fact, you could be wasting more than 33% of your fuel economy. It?s best if you drive sensibly, maintaining normal speeds and braking slowly. Not only does this step benefit your gas mileage, but it also keeps you safer on the road. 2. Maintain the Speed LimitOnce you start traveling above 60 mph, your car uses more fuel than it needs to. In fact, for every five mph you travel over this speed, you could be spending an extra $0.30 a gallon for fuel. There?s another way you save money by driving the speed limit. You avoid the chance of speeding tickets, which can be extremely expensive. 3. Remove Extra WeightIf you are carrying a bunch of cargo around with you that?s not needed, go ahead and unload it. For every 100 pounds of cargo you carry, you reduce the fuel economy by 2 percent. Keep a bin in the vehicle and fill it up after every trip with the gear that?s not needed. By carrying this bin inside at the end of the day, you gain maximum fuel economy for your next trip. 4. Maintain the VehicleThe manufacturer?s maintenance schedule isn?t meant to simply earn the dealership more money. It?s designed to ensure that your car runs efficiently and the engine is optimized.If your car hasn?t been tuned up, you could lose about 4 percent of the gas mileage. Plus, it could fail an emissions test. 5. Check Tire PressuresBy ensuring the tires are properly inflated, you can improve gas mileage by more than 3%. Underinflated tires reduce gas mileage significantly for every one psi of pressure that is missing.To find the right amount of tire pressure for your car, read the label inside the driver?s side door jamb. You should check the pressures every month and any time the temperatures drop. 6. Use Right OilYou won?t get a big fuel economy boost by using the right oil, but every little bit helps. If your engine calls for 5W-30, don?t swap it with 10W-30 out of convenience. You can also shop for engine oil based on brands that offer ?Energy Conserving? properties on the API performance symbol. These oils contain additives that reduce friction for even more optimization."
What does the Tire Pressure Sensor Fault mean?	"The ?Tire Pressure Sensor Fault? message indicates that there is an issue with the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS). There is most likely an issue with a tire pressure sensor or the connection to the sensor.The error code may tell you that the tires? air pressure is too low or too high or that one of the tire pressure sensors is defective.It could also be caused by a faulty TPMS control unit, faulty wiring, or a TPMS reset. The easiest way to find out is to read the error codes from your TPMS control unit with an OBD2 scanner."
what are the 4 Causes of the Tire Pressure Sensor Fault message ?	"There are some reasons that could cause the tire pressure sensor fault message to appear on your dashboards. Remember to always check the trouble codes before making any conclusions, though. Here is a list of the 4 most common causes of a tire pressure sensor fault message:1. Faulty Tire Pressure SensorTire Pressure Sensor E1609809096288A faulty tire pressure sensor is, unfortunately, the most common cause of this message. Tire pressure sensors are located in the tires and have batteries in them. After some years, these batteries may run out of batteries, and you have to replace the whole sensor.2. Tire pressure sensor lost memoryTire Pressure SensorsSometimes it happens that the tire pressure control module and the tire pressure sensors lose communication with each other. If this happens, it can sometimes work to reprogram the sensors. To reprogram the sensors, you need a TPMS reset tool.3. You changed wheelsChange TiresIf you live in a colder country with cold weather, you probably change between the summer and winter tires. You may not know that you have to reset the TPMS after the wheel change, and if your car was never equipped with these tires before, you need to program the sensors to your car. If the tire pressure sensor fault message appeared after the tire change ? you might need to program the sensors.4. Low Tire PressureCheck Tire PressureIn some car models, the tire pressure sensor fault light can also mean low tire pressure in your car. Inflating your car tires is pretty easy, but if you don?t know how to do it, you can go to any workshop or fuel station and let it do for you. Make sure that you do not overpressurize your tires, as the tire pressure sensor fault light is also activated when the tire air pressure is too high. The tire pressure must be exactly correct."
How does a TPMS system work?	"A TPMS system can operate in two different ways. If you have a vehicle manufactured after 2007, you will most likely have a TPMS system in your vehicle. Some vehicles have sensors in each of the tires. The sensors detect what tire pressure you have and send that information to your TPMS control unitIf the tire pressure is too high or too low, or the control unit cannot communicate with your sensors, the message ?Tire Pressure Sensor Fault? appears on your dashboard.Other cars have no sensors in their tires, and they use the ABS sensors to calculate your wheel rotation. If you have low pressure, the wheel diameter will be more compressed and must rotate faster to reach the same speed as the car. If the speed at one wheel is different than the other wheels, the vehicle stores this as an error code in your TPMS or ABS.For this reason, you must drive for a distance before the car displays the tire pressure for you. This is only a simple estimation and not the exact tire pressure."
How to fix the ?Tire Pressure Sensor Fault? Message?	"Fixing the tire pressure sensor is often pretty straightforward, and here are some tips on how to easily fix this message.1. Check tire pressureInflate TireFirst, you should make sure that you have the correct tire pressure in all your tires. Check your tire pressure with a tire pressure gauge. To find the correct pressure, you should check the tire pressure label. You can often find the label on the body behind the driver?s door. You can also find it in your repair manual.2. Reset with the tire pressure button or with a ScannerOnce you have inflated your tires to the correct pressure, you often have to manually reset the system. Some cars have a reset button, and in some cars, you should drive for around 15 minutes until the lights go out. Refer to your repair manual to reset the TPMS system on your vehicle. In some vehicles, you need a diagnostic tool to reset it.3. Read trouble codesIf the error still occurs, you will need to read the TPMS system error codes to see the error codes. It could be a communication error with one of your tire pressure sensors or a damaged tire pressure sensor. Only the diagnostic tool can tell you. Remember that, in order to read the TPMS control module, you will need a diagnostic scanner to read enhanced trouble codes.4. Reprogram Tire Pressure SensorsSometimes the tire pressure sensors lose the communication or programming values to the TPMS control module. If this happens, you have to reprogram all sensors to the control module. This can often be done with a quality TPMS reset tool.5. Replace faulty tire pressure sensorIf you have tried everything but the problem still occurs, you probably have a faulty tire pressure sensor. Check the trouble codes to see which sensor is implicated, and replace that sensor. Do not forget to reprogram the sensors after you do this.Where is the tire pressure sensor located?Tpms Sensor Location E1609807829627Tire pressure sensors are typically installed inside your car tires. You can usually see it when you look at the tire air valve. When a tire pressure sensor is installed, you can often see a nut placed around the valve, but not in all cases.The only way to find this out is to remove the tires from the rim or call your authorized dealer and ask them."
Is it okay to drive with a tire pressure sensor fault?	Yes. It is okay to drive with a tire pressure sensor failure if you check and monitor the pressure in your tires to ensure the pressure is correct. Driving with low tire pressure is both dangerous and bad for your car.
How much does a new tire sensor cost?	"The price can range from $30 to $80 for a new tire pressure sensor, but it depends on the type of sensor. If you don?t know how to install and program the sensor yourself, it will generally cost an additional $30 to $50 to pay a mechanic to do it for you."
Can I replace tire sensors by  myself?	"You can replace a tire pressure sensor yourself, but it?s not easy. The sensors are located inside the tire, so you have to remove the tire to get to them. And if you don?t have the right tools or expertise, you could damage the sensor or the tire."
How much does it cost to fix a tire pressure sensor fault?	"Fixing a tire pressure sensor fault message can cost anywhere from $0 to $500. If the cause of the failure is only low tire pressure, you can fix it for free. However, if there is an electrical fault or a faulty tire sensor, you could spend a few hundred dollars."
Conclusion	"The tire pressure sensor fault message indicates that there is a problem with the tire pressure monitoring system. The tire pressure monitoring system includes the TPMS sensors and the TPMS signal receiver.When there is a problem with the TPMS system, it is in most cases either because of incorrect tire pressure in one of your tires, or because the TPMS system was not properly reset. However, it can also happen if a TPMS sensor loses memory or is bad.A tire pressure sensor fault is a common problem that can be easily fixed. By checking your tires regularly and keeping them inflated to the proper pressure, you can avoid this issue in many cases.If you do experience a tire pressure sensor fault, but don?t have the knowledge to inspect these issues yourself, don?t hesitate to take your car to a qualified mechanic to have it diagnosed and repaired as soon as possible!"
What Causes An Oil Pressure Warning Light?	"The most common cause of a low oil pressure warning light coming on is a low oil level. It can also be caused by a faulty oil pump, pickup tube, clogged oil filter or an internal oil leak. It could be a false alarm, caused by a bad oil pressure sensor or faulty wiring.As said, there are actually two scenarios when the oil pressure light illuminates. It can either be a false alarm or a problem with the oil pressure sensor or the wirings to it.The other scenario is that your engine actually has low oil pressure, which is a little bit more serious. Therefore, we recommend starting checking the oil pressure with a manual oil pressure guide to know where to start your troubleshooting. Here is a video of how to check the oil pressure.Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of an oil pressure light on your dashboard:1. Low Engine Oil LevelEngine Oil LevelTo achieve proper oil pressure in the engine, the engine needs to have oil available to pressurize. If there is no oil to pressurize, it will be impossible for the oil pump to properly do its job.If your oil pressure light comes on and sometimes disappears, especially when you turn the car, a low engine oil level might be the cause. You may also notice a yellow oil can symbol on your dashboard.Checking the engine oil level is pretty straightforward. Just check your car?s service manual, and you will find instructions there on how to do it properly.However, as a car owner, it is your responsibility to check the oil level regularly. This is a vital part of regular car maintenance. You may easily destroy your engine if you drive without checking your oil level on a regular basis.2. Faulty Oil Pressure SensorOil Pressure Sensor LocationThe oil pressure is actually the sensor that monitors the engine?s oil pressure, and its only job is to switch the oil pressure light on or off. These sensors are often made of plastic, and it is not unheard of for these sensors to fail.If you locate it on the engine block and you see a lot of engine oil around it, that may be a sign that there is a crack in the sensor, which may cause it to fail to read the oil pressure properly.You can measure these sensors? resistance with a multimeter to determine if they are functional or not. You need to find the right values for the specific sensor, though. Here is a video of how you can check it: How to test an oil pressure sensor3. Faulty Oil Pressure Sensor WiringsBroken WiringsFor the sensor to function, it needs one or two wires going between the instrument cluster and the oil pressure sensor.The engine compartment becomes hot while you are driving, and there are constant vibrations. This can cause wirings to get a bad connection or actually fail and break off completely.When the instrument cluster can?t feel the signal from the oil pressure sensor because of a broken wire or bad connection, it will light up the oil pressure light.Check the connector at the oil pressure sensor for any corrosion signs, and make sure that the wires look good.The next step is to measure the wiring, but I?m not going to explain how to do that in this article. At the very least, you will need a wiring diagram and some basic car electrical skills.It is not very common for the wires to go bad, so it is recommended to check the rest of the potential causes in this article first.4. Faulty Oil PumpOil Pressure InsideThe oil pump is the pump that pressurizes the oil inside of the engine. A chain often drives it from the crankshaft, but it can also be built directly around the crankshaft.It sometimes happens that this oil pump fails, which can cause a low oil pressure. The low oil pressure will cause the oil pressure light to show up on your dashboard.The oil pump also has an overpressure valve inside of it, which can fail, and this will also cause the oil pressure to drop.However, to replace this valve, you often need to disassemble the whole engine, so you anyways want to replace the whole oil pump instead of just the valve.5. Clogged Oil Pickup TubeVw Oil Pressure HiccupFor the oil pump to reach the oil all the way from the bottom of the oil pan, it must have a tube. Unfortunately, dirt is also collected on the bottom of the oil pan.This tube contains a ?net? to prevent dirt and other parts from getting sucked into the oil pump. If your car is old, and especially if the car?s oil maintenance has been bad, this pickup tube can get clogged by dirt and other oil sludge.When this tube gets clogged, it will cause the oil pump not to suck oil anymore, resulting in low oil pressure.To fix this issue, you need to remove the oil pan and clean or replace the oil pump pickup tube.6. Clogged Oil filterBad Oil FiltersInside a car engine, there are often many metal chips, carbon deposits, and other debris. The oil filter plays an important role in filtering all these contaminants and preventing them from entering the engine.During regular maintenance of the engine, the mechanic replaces the oil filter. If you follow the schedule of oil changes recommended for your car engine, there is no risk of getting a clogged oil filter.However, if you haven?t taken care of your car?s service maintenance properly, you may actually get a clogged oil filter caused by oil sludge. Your oil pressure to drop, causing an oil pressure light on your dashboard.7. Faulty Instrument ClusterInstrument Cluster FailedIt?s possible that there isn?t any problem with the sensor or low oil pressure at all. It may actually just be a problem with the instrument cluster.Inside the instrument cluster, there are many solderings, and in some car models, cracks can appear in these solderings. This will cause the connection to get worse, and eventually, it will light up the oil pressure light.To find these solderings, you need to help a professional who knows how to disassemble the cluster and check for cracks.To replace the cluster, you often need to reprogram it to the vehicle with a diagnostic tool, because the immobilizer is often integrated into it. This can often only be done by an authorized dealer.8. Internal Oil LeakCrankcase CarInternal oil leaks mean that the oil is leaking inside the engine, and you cannot see it without disassembling the engine. This is a fairly rare scenario and should only be considered if you have eliminated all other possible causes.Internal oil leaks are also very difficult to find, and you will need to disassemble the engine to look for cracks or other signs of leaks.9. Clogged oil passagesEngine BlockMost of the engine oil is stored in the oil pan. The oil pump pressurizes the oil to circulate to the engine and the subsequent moving parts.As soon as the oil leaves the pump, it moves through the oil filter. This removes most of the impurities. The oil then flows through the crankshaft and the head of the car engine.However, if any of these oil passages are clogged, it may cause the oil not to reach the oil pressure sensor, and it will cause the oil pressure to become low.This isn?t a very common problem either, and everything else should be considered first before you look into it.10. Wear of engine partsBad Rod BearingOil is needed to keep the crankshaft, cam bearings, and other moving parts working at their best.When these components wear out like bad bearings, oil begins to leak through the openings. This leak might contribute to low oil pressure.If you have noticed a slowly decreasing oil pressure in your engine over time, it can definitely be a sign of wear inside of your engine."
Direct and Indirect TPMS ?	"Before we move on to reset the TPMS system, it is important to understand your car?s type of monitoring system. There are 2 main types of TPMS: Direct and Indirect.The direct TPMS has sensors located on the tire?s pressure valve or the rim. These sensors collect information and send it to the car?s onboard computer. However, the direct TPMS will most likely malfunction due to bad weather conditions. It is usually found in cars in the United States.The indirect TPMS has sensors placed on the car?s ABS brakes and/or the speed sensors on each wheel. These sensors measure the wheel rotation speed and identify changes as underinflated tires rotate much faster compared to regularly filled tires. This system is most often found in cars in Europe."
How to Reset a Tire Pressure Light (TPMS) ?	"Resetting the TPMS differs from car to car, but some general techniques are easy to execute and help successfully recalibrate the monitoring system. Follow these steps to reset the TPMS light:Total Time: 5 minutesMake Sure You Have the Correct PressureCheck Tire PressureBefore you try to reset your TPMS light, you should always ensure that you have the right tire pressure in your vehicle.  Use a tire pressure gauge to check the tire pressure. Inflate each tire to its ideal PSI, then deflate the tires to zero. Then inflate again and drive for a couple of minutes at 15 mph to manually calibrate the sensors. If you want to learn more about how to find the correct tire pressure, you can check out this guide: Tire pressureUse the Car?s TPMS Reset ButtonTpms ButtonMost cars with direct TPMS have a reset button located under the steering wheel through which you can conveniently re-calibrate the sensors. These buttons can be located in different places depending on the car model. Check your car owner?s manual. Put the key in the ignition and turn on the battery but don?t start the car. Push the reset button for about 3 seconds or until the system?s light starts blinking. Start the vehicle and drive for 20 to 25 minutes, then turn off the ignition. Some newer cars have this reset in the menuDrive at 50 mphDrivingThis might be the easiest method, as it requires you to drive your car at 50 mph for about 10 miles. The sensors will automatically calibrate themselves after you have made sure that the tires have the right tire pressure. Some vehicles require a higher speed, and you can also use the cruise control to keep the speed constant. This method works only in some car models, often those that use the indirect method to measure tire air pressure.Remove and Re-Connect the Car BatteryDisconnect Car BatteryEvery car has an onboard computer that may face certain glitches from time to time. The best way to fix these glitches is to reset the computer, and this can be done by disconnecting and reconnecting the battery.Open your car?s hood and look for the battery?s negative terminal. Remove the negative terminal to disconnect the battery, then press the vehicle?s horn to drain out any remaining power. Reconnect the positive terminal, and the TPMS warning light should go away.Use a TPMS Reset Tool for Your VehicleTpms Reset ToolThere are a lot of different TPMS reset tools on the market. In some cases, you will have to reprogram the sensors if they have lost their information, and you need a TPMS reset tool for this job. With a TPMS reset tool, you can often reset the TPMS light with an easy click of a button. If you are interested in buying a tool like this, I recommend the Autel TS401 MaxiTPMS Activation Tool Link from Amazon. You can also reset the TPMS light with a diagnostic scanner if you have a good OBD2 scanner. Always make sure the tools are compatible with your vehicle before making a purchase.Damaged SensorsIf the above-mentioned techniques do not work, it may mean that the sensors may have been damaged and will have to be replaced. The sensors can get damaged due to various reasons; for example, tire replacement, brake repairing, oil change, filter change, or even during normal tire service.The sensors do also have batteries inside of them, which will drail out after a couple of years.You can also try out these specific methods depending on your car make and model."
Where is the TPMS Reset Button Located?	"The TPMS reset button is often located under the steering wheel or integrated with the car?s information display system. This heavily differs depending on which car model you have though.Down below, you will find some more vehicle-specific information about where the button is located."
TPMS Reset Honda Vehicles Introduced After 2016	"If you own a 2016 or later Honda car with a touchscreen display, follow these steps to easily re-calibrate the TPMS.Go to the home screenSelect settingsClick TPMS calibrationSelect ?Calibrate?For models without a touch display, use buttons on the steering wheel to select ?TPMS Calibration? and chose the ?Calibrate? option."
TPMS Reset Honda Vehicles	"For old Honda models without touch display, use steering wheel buttons and calibrate through these steps:Select MenuSelect ?Customize Setting?Choose TPMS CalibrationClick InitializeFor models without any display screen, a TPMS reset button can be found on the steering wheel?s left. Press the button for a couple of seconds, then release it to re-calibrate the system."
TPMS Reset Chevrolet Models	"Resetting TPMS on Chevrolet models can be performed at home as well, but it requires a J-46079 Tire Pressure Monitor Tester, which can be bought from eBay.Put the key in the ignition and turn to the ?ON? position, but don?t start the vehicle.Using the driver instrument cluster, click the ?Vehicle Information? button and navigate to ?Relearn Tire Position?.Click ?Set/Reset? and a message saying ?Tire Learning Active? will pop up.If you own an old model without an instrument cluster, press the odometer reset button until ?Tire Learning Active? message is displayed.Connect the J-46079 Tire Pressure Monitor Tester to the left front tire and press the active button. Wait for 10 seconds until a horn chirp sound is heard. Repeat the process for the remaining tires.Once all tires are done, turn the key to the ?OFF? position.Re-inflate the tires according to the recommended PSI."
TPMS Reset Volkswagen Models	"Resetting TPMS on a Volkswagen differs from model to model. The reset button can be found inside the glove box or near the gear shift for old models. Once the button is found, press it for a couple of seconds until a beep is heard, then release.For newer models, the TPMS can be re-calibrated easily through the infotainment system."
TPMS Reset Mini Models	"The TPMS on Mini models can be re-calibrated easily through the button as well. For old models (2002 to 2006), the reset button can be found in the emergency brake handle?s front cabin.Turn on the ignition ? but don?t start the car ? and press the reset button until the yellow indicator on the dashboard starts blinking. The TPS will be automatically calibrated on your next drive.On the newer models (2007 and onwards), start the car and navigate to ?Set/Info? on the instrument cluster. Scroll down until the tire monitor symbol is displayed, click on reset, and re-calibrate the TPMS system."
TPMS Reset Toyota Models	"Toyota cars normally have a reset button under the steering wheel. The reset button can be hard to find, and you can find it in the lowest area in front of your pedals. Just press the reset button for 5 seconds while the ignition is on, and the TPMS should be reset.Turn the ignition ONPress the reset button for 5 secondsTurn off the ignitionStart your car and check if the light is gone"
Post-Reset Tips	"Once the TPMS system resets and the warning light goes away, you can follow a few maintenance tips to avoid the problem in the future.If you replace the valve-system core, choose a stainless steel core instead of a brass core.Never leave the tire without a cap screwed to the valve stem.Do not use aerosol flat fixer as it damages the sensor capability to measure changes.Take your car to an authorized dealership to have your vehicle and tires inspected."
Can I Remove the TPMS Function instead?	"It is possible, but you should remember that getting rid of the TPMS is not the right solution. According to the law proposed by ?The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),? all cars newer than 2008 are required to be equipped with a TPMS. This law was introduced to minimize the number of road accidents due to overinflated or underinflated tires."
When should I reset my TPMS?	"The TPMS, or tire pressure monitoring system, should be reset when you change your tires. This is because most TPMS systems calculate your current tire pressure based on the size and weight of your original tires. When you switch to a different set of tires, the TMS will not give an accurate reading."
Do I have to reprogram TPMS sensors when changing tires?	"It depends on the car model. In some cars, you need to reprogram TPMS sensors when changing tires because the pressure information the sensors transmit will be incorrect if they are not calibrated to the new tires. In other car models, simply resetting the TPMS with the reset button may be sufficient."
Do TPMS sensors reset themselves?	"Some TPMS sensors do reset themselves, but many do not. It depends on the make and model of the sensor. Some sensors have a ?learn mode? that needs to be activated before the sensor will start transmitting data again. Others will continue to transmit data even if they are not reset. If you?re not sure how to reset your TPMS sensor, consult the owner?s manual or contact the manufacturer for assistance."
Can I drive with the TPMS light on?	"While you can drive with a TPMS light on, it is not recommended as you will lose the ability to monitor tire pressure without doing so manually. It?s important to take care of this as soon as possible, as driving with an underinflated tire can lead to decreased fuel economy and increased wear and tear. If the TPMS light comes on while you?re driving, pull over at the next safe opportunity and check your tires? air pressure levels. You can typically find the recommended levels in your car?s owner?s manual."
Conclusion	"To reset a TPMS system, you must either press the TPMS reset button or use a TPMS reset tool after inflating the tires and making sure the tire pressure is correct. In some car models, the TPMS system will reset itself after you inflate the tires and drive for a while above 50 mph.If your TPMS system has been reset according to the correct procedure for your car model and the TPMS light is still on, you may still have a problem with incorrect tire pressure in one or more of your tires.Try checking the air pressure in each tire with another more accurate gauge (don?t trust gas station gauges) and inflate them up to the recommended PSI rating. If the light comes back on after driving for a while, there may be a faulty TPMS sensor in one of the tires."
what is the VDC Light Meaning ?	"VDC stands for Vehicle Dynamic Control and the VDC light illuminates when there is an issue with the anti-lock brake system or the traction control system.Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) works with your car?s anti-lock brake system to provide more traction. When VDC is engaged, you might feel some vibration occur in the brake pedal. This doesn?t mean that something is wrong with the system; it only indicates that everything is working as it should.In most cases, the VDC is going to apply brakes individually at the wheels to counteract any slippage that occurs. If the vehicle is understeering, VDC applies the brakes on the outer front wheel, causing it to turn the way it should. While VDC will not steer the vehicle, it does offer input to make the car easier to maneuver.The VDC system is consistently monitoring the direction and steering of the vehicle. It determines what the driver intends to do compared with what the vehicle is actually doing. If there is no deviation, VDC does nothing. However, if there is a problem, the VDC system enables to counteract the loss of traction and wheel slippage. "
what are the Causes of VDC Light ?	"The most common causes of a VDC light are a defective ABS wheel sensor, a malfunctioning steering angle sensor, or low brake fluid. It can also show up if you are driving on a low-quality road. In rare cases, it can be caused by a bad steering rack or a bad control module.Here is a more detailed list of the common causes of a VDC light:1. Defective Wheel SensorsAbs Sensor CloseAt each wheel, there are sensors attached that monitor speed and function. Any information provided by these sensors is sent to the ECU for analysis. For example, if a wheel begins to slip, causing it to turn faster than the others, the speed is sent to the ECU to show there is a problem.The VDC system kicks in to reduce power to that wheel and provide better traction. However, if you have a faulty wheel sensor, the correct data might not be sent. The VDC light will go on, alerting you that the sensor is broken or has debris on it. 2. Malfunctioning Steering Angle Sensors Steering Angle Sensor LocationAny wheel that has traction control is also going to contain steering angle sensors. The job of these sensors is to measure the angle of the wheel as you drive. However, the sensors are subject to malfunction because of their location.When the sensors fail or become contaminated with debris, the VDC light will come on. You will notice this can happen even when you are driving on smooth roads with no extra need for traction control. 3. Low Brake FluidLow brake fluid is a common problem that can cause the VDC light to come on. As your brakes wear, the brake fluid will get lower and lower in the reservoir even if it isn?t leaking. When you change the brake pads and push in the brake caliper, the level will go back up.You need to check the brake fluid reservoir in the engine compartment and add brake fluid if the level is low.4. Low-Quality RoadsThe VDC system is meant to create stability while traveling across slippery terrain. However, the system can malfunction if the conditions are extreme.If you are driving across ice and snow, you might see the VDC light come on for a moment until traction is restored. However, as soon as the car begins driving normally again, the light should disappear. 5. Bad Steering RackThe steering rack is responsible for controlling the wheels based on the input from the steering wheel. It is located on the body of the car as part of the steering system.The steering rack uses hydraulic fluid, which turns the wheels. If the rack fails or malfunctions, there might be trouble steering the vehicle, causing the VDC light to turn on. 6. Defective ECUThere are numerous sensors communicating with the car?s computer at all times. The computer is responsible for taking the data from the sensors and translating it into action. As the wheels begin to slip, the ECU needs to cut power to the wheel for correction.However, the ECU is not foolproof, and it can go bad when the ECU doesn?t read the messages from the sensors, which can cause the VDC light to come on.  "
how to Fixe the VDC Light ?	"To fix the VDC light, you must first figure out what the problem is. If the light is only illuminated because of the road you are on, it should go off when travel returns to normal. In this case, no fix is required. However, if the VDC light is on because of a defective sensor, you will need to replace it. Sometimes, the sensors can be cleaned, which saves you some money. A mechanic will also check the wiring of the sensors to ensure everything is working as it should. However, if your vehicle requires a new steering rack or ECU, you are looking at a more costly repair. The steering rack can be difficult to replace, requiring more time. The ECU must also be professionally reprogrammed. The easiest way to fix a VDC light is by checking the brake fluid level and topping it up if it?s low. Then read the trouble codes with a diagnostic scanner.You also want to look for technical service bulletins and recalls for your car model. For example, you can find bulletins for the VDC light on some Infiniti car models."
What does the ESP light mean?	"The ESP Light indicates there is a problem with your electronic stability program system or that you are driving on a slippery surface. When you drive through slippery surfaces, the ESP light will turn on and flash on your dashboard when it?s working.If the light is constant and not flashing on and off, you have a problem associated with your Electronic Stability Program."
How does the ESP system work?	"The ESP does not work alone. It works in conjunction with the traction control and the anti-locking brakes (ABS). Modern cars have an onboard computer that monitors most of the car?s functions.If one wheel slips, the ESP will control the other wheels by reducing power and applying the brakes to correct your car?s stability.The ESP can also inform the car?s engine to reduce power if your car is steering dangerously. This will then influence the power that is being supplied to individual wheels. This comes in handy when, for example, you keep revving the car on the icy ground, but there is no traction on the wheels. Power will be reduced, enabling you to have more grip on the wheel."
what are the  Causes of an ESP warning light?	"The most common reason the ESP light illuminates is because of a faulty ABS sensor or ABS ring. It can also be caused by issues like a bad throttle body, brake pedal switch, or steering sensor. If it?s blinking while driving on a slippery surface, it?s working correctly.The ESP works together with the ABS. This makes it hard to identify the main cause of the problem immediately.To determine the problem causing the ESP light, it is always recommended to check the trouble codes with a diagnostic scanner.Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of an ESP light.1. Faulty ABS Speed SensorCar Abs SensorThe wheel sensors send information about each wheel?s speed to the ABS control unit. The ABS control unit then measures this information and applies necessary solutions when one or more wheel slips.If one ABS sensor fails, it may think that one wheel is slipping even when it isn?t, which will cause the light to come on.2. Faulty ABS ringsBroken Abs RingThe same thing applies to the ABS rings. The ABS sensor measures the wheel speed from the ABS rings. These rings sometimes break, and when that happens, it will cause the ABS sensor to measure the wrong speed.3. Faulty Throttle bodyThrottle BodyThe throttle body is used to control the power output for the ESP system when your car slips. If there is anything wrong with the throttle body, it will cause the ESP light to come on.4. Faulty Brake Pedal SwitchBrake Pedal PushThe ESP system needs to know when you are pressing the brake pedal. For this function to work properly, there is a brake pedal switch installed on your brake pedal.If this switch is faulty and sends out the wrong information, it may cause the ESP light to come on.5. Faulty Steering Angle sensorSteering AngleThe ESP system also uses the steering angle to calculate what to do in a slipping situation. If your steering angle sensor is becoming worse or is not programmed correctly, it may cause the ESP light to come on.6. ABS wiring issuesAbs Broken WiringYou do also have wirings from the ABS control unit to each wheel sensor at each wheel. These wires move a lot because of the suspension, and this can often cause the wiring to become worse when your vehicle becomes old.The easiest method to see this is to measure the ABS sensors from the connector plug at the control unit. To do so, you need to check a repair manual for the correct pinout."
What to do if the ESP light comes on?	"If your ESP light illuminates, you need to check the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner to see what is causing the ESP light to come on. Just guessing and replacing parts you think are faulty, will likely waste a lot of your money.You can either check the trouble codes at a workshop or do it yourself at home with an OBD2 scanner."
Is it safe to drive with the ESP light on?	"If you are not used to driving without the ESP, it is probably not safe to drive with the ESP light on. The ESP system is designed to maintain the traction of your wheels on slippery surfaces, and it is important that it works correctly. If the light is on, it means there is a problem with the system, and the ESP system will be disabled."
Is ESP the same as traction control?	"No. The ESP system is not the same as the traction control system. The traction control system is designed to prevent slipping and skidding when cornering, while the ESP system is designed to prevent your wheels from spinning on slippery surfaces."
What happens if you drive with ESP off?	"If you drive with ESP off, the only difference is that the ESP system will be switched off. If the ESP system is disabled, your car?s tires will spin freely on slippery surfaces, and if you are not used to this, it can make it difficult to control your vehicle and could result in an accident. ESP can help prevent accidents, so it?s important to keep it on while driving."
How do I reset my ESP warning light?	"To reset an ESP warning light, you must use an OBD2 scanner. However, simply clearing the fault code memory will likely not solve the problem permanently. To get rid of the ESP warning light, you need to fix the problem that is causing the light to appear in the first place."
Conclusion	"The ESP light indicates that there is a problem with your car?s electronic stability program (ESP) that needs to be repaired. It can also flash if you are driving on a slippery surface. The ESP system cooperates with the traction control, the ABS system and the engine control system.The first thing you should do if you see an ESP light on your dashboard is to read the trouble codes from the ABS, traction control, and engine control systems. For this, you need a good OBD2 scanner compatible with your vehicle.If you see this light come on and feel like you don?t have enough knowledge, it?s important to have your vehicle checked out as soon as possible by a professional mechanic. While the problem may be something minor, such as a dirty sensor, it can also indicate a more serious problem."
What Does The ESP BAS Light Mean?	"The ESP BAS Light indicates a problem with the electronic stability program or brake assist program with your vehicle. Some of the top causes for this light include defective wheel speed sensors, a bad steering angle sensor, a bad brake switch, or other braking system failures. The light comes on for a variety of problems, ranging from mild to serious. However, the codes can be read with the help of a handheld code scanner that?s compatible with these systems. "
what are the  Causes ESP BAS Light ?	"1. Defective Steering Angle SensorSteering Angle Sensor LocationModern vehicles contain advanced sensors, including one for the steering angle. Sadly, this sensor also leads to the majority of reasons that the ESP BAS Light comes on. The steering wheel sensor keeps the steering wheel in line with the car?s wheels. With the help of the sensor, the car knows which way you turn the steering wheel based on the input given by the steering angle sensor. The sensor can lose contact due to a poor connection, causing the ESP BAS light to show up on your dashboard. It could also mean that the sensor has failed. 2. Bad Wheel Speed SensorAbs Sensor CloseEach wheel contains a speed sensor that measures how fast the wheel is moving. These sensors are also part of the vehicle?s ESP BAS system. With the help of these sensors, the ESP BAS system can tell when traction has been lost, so it can counteract the issue.In normal circumstances, the ESP BAS Light can come on because traction has been lost momentarily. However, as soon as the situation is resolved, the light should go off on its own. If it doesn?t, there?s a chance that one of the wheel speed sensors is bad. 3. Failed Brake SwitchBrake Light SwitchThe brake switch can also cause the light to come on. Even though this part is supposed to last forever, there?s always the chance that it has failed. The switch turns on the rear brake lights when you push down on the pedal. If it isn?t working, people behind you might not know that you are stopping or slowing down. That?s why the failed switch must be replaced as soon as you are aware of the defect. 4. Wiring IssuesThere are a lot of wires going between all the different sensors and the ABS control module. The wirings to the ABS wheel speed sensors are attached to the wheels, and sometimes they get damaged.This is not very common in newer car models, as the wirings are often very protected, but it can still happen if you are unlucky. The bad thing about wiring issues is that they can be very difficult to find if you are not experienced.        "
How To Fix The ESP BAS Light?	"The easiest way to determine what is causing the ESP BAS light is to read the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner from the ABS control module in your car. This will help you locate the issue or start troubleshooting instead of just guessing and replacing parts.Here are some other common things that can fix the ESP Bas warning light:1. Recalibrate Steering Angle SensorSometimes, the steering angle sensor just needs to be recalibrated. You can do this in your driveway without any special tools.Sit behind the wheel of your car and gently turn the wheel from one side to another, where it would lock. You might also need to cycle the key for the calibration to take effect. In some cases, an OBDII scanner can recalibrate the steering angle sensor. Read the codes and recalibrate as needed. 2. Replace Steering Angle SensorIf the calibration doesn?t fix the problem, you might need to replace the sensor. Thankfully, this job is usually simple and only requires the use of a socket and ratchet.Make sure you unplug the battery first. You must then remove the airbag from the steering wheel by pushing on the clip located on the rear of the wheel. Lock the steering wheel in the center and use your socket and ratchet to remove the main nut.Mark the wheel?s position, so you know where the center is. After you remove the clock spring, you will see the sensor. Take it out and put the new one back in. Connect everything back up and turn on the vehicle. You will also need to recalibrate the system for the light to turn off. 3. Replace Wheel Speed SensorBehind each set of braking discs, you can find the wheel speed sensor. Because of how easy it is to access, it?s relatively simple to replace a defective sensor, but sometimes it can get stuck by rust.Jack up the vehicle and remove the affected wheel. When you take off the sensor, you can pop the new one in its place with ease. 4. Install New Brake Switch SensorWith your OBDII code scanner, you can hunt down the problems with the brake switch sensor. Unlike some of the other sensors, this one is inexpensive. You will find it located above the brake pedal. Simply unplug the defective sensor and put the new one in. You might also need to reset any codes that were set to turn the light off. 5. Repair BrakesIf it?s time for a brake job, get it done and see if it turns the light off. Put the car up on jack stands and take the wheels off. When you unbolt the brake caliper, make sure you rest it somewhere, so none of the lines break.From here, you can remove the rotor and replace it if needed. You might prefer to have it resurfaced if there is still plenty of material available. Additionally, it?s not hard to replace the brake pads. The problem comes in when the caliper is stuck. Unless you have advanced brake system expertise, you might need to have a professional help out."
What Does The DSC Malfunction Light Mean?	"The Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) Light illuminates when there is an issue within the stability control system. It can also show up and start blinking while you are driving on a slippery surface.While that?s a lot of potential meanings for a light, if you know how it functions, then it?s pretty easy to understand what it?s telling you when it turns on."
what is the DSC Light Function ?	"As I noted above, there are several different reasons that your DSC light might be on, but understanding the way it functions makes everything a little more clear.When you first turn on your vehicle, it goes through a system check. During this system check, your vehicle checks every component in your vehicle to ensure it is functioning correctly. When you look at the dash, you?ll see all the lights come on and then turn off. This is completely normal, and as long as the DSC light turns off, you?re good to go.From there, the DSC light will turn on and stay on if there is a problem in the system. If the DSC light stays on, that?s when you should consider taking your vehicle to a mechanic. But before you do, check out the causes section below ? I might be able to save you a little bit of money with a quick fix.Finally, your DSC light will come on when the system is in use. Unlike when there?s a problem in the system, the light will flash on and off repeatedly when this is happening. Additionally, you?ll feel your vehicle applying the brakes to specific wheels to help you maintain control of your vehicle.Once your vehicle regains stability, the light should stay off, and everything should work as expected. Unless the DSC light is coming on when it shouldn?t, this isn?t a problem and you?re good to go."
what are the DSC Light Causes ?	"The most common causes of a BMW DSC light are that you?ve accidentally turned the system off or you have a faulty wheel speed sensor. But while those might be the most common problems, they aren?t the only things that could be causing your problem.Below, I?ve highlighted the four most common causes of a DSC light.1. The DSC System Is Turned OffBmw ButtonsWhether you know it or not, you can turn your DSC system off. All you need to do to turn the system off in a BMW is hold the DSC light for at least three seconds. This will disable the DSC system, which can be helpful if you?re trying to drift.But once you?ve turned the system off, the DSC light will appear in the dash. Before you take your vehicle to a mechanic, try holding the DSC light button for at least three seconds to see if you can turn it back on. If you?ve already tried this and it didn?t work, then you have an actual problem you need to address.2. Faulty Wheel Speed SensorAbs Sensor CloseThe most common underlying problem in a faulty DSC system is a defective wheel speed sensor. Your BMW uses these sensors to determine when one or more of the wheels is slipping. But when one of the sensors is giving errant readings or is completely offline, then the system can?t work like it?s supposed to, and you get a DSC light on the dashboard, often together with an ABS light.3. Faulty Steering Angle SensorSteering Angle Sensor LocationAnother critical component in your BMW?s DSC system is the steering angle sensor. This component is critical because as you turn, your vehicle?s outside wheels turn faster than the inside wheels.This is completely normal, but if the steering angle sensor reports that you?re still heading straight while you?re actually turning, then the DSC system will think that the wheels are slipping. If this happens, the DSC system can kick on when it shouldn?t.4. Wiring/Electrical ProblemsIt doesn?t matter if all the sensors are working the way they should if they can?t communicate with the ECM or aren?t getting power. That?s why it?s crucial to verify your connections before replacing sensors.While it?s more common to have a faulty sensor than broken or corroded wires, it?s not unheard of. The most likely place you?ll run into these problems with the wiring is right at the wheel speed sensors where the wiring is exposed to the elements."
Is It Safe To Drive With a DSC Light?	"While it?s never as safe to drive with a DSC light compared to when you?re driving with a functioning system, you can usually drive with a DSC light. But this depends on if you know what the underlying condition is.Because there is a possibility that the DSC system could kick on when it shouldn?t while you?re driving. While it?s rare, it can happen. On the other hand, if you?ve manually turned off the DSC system or you know that it?s completely disabled, it?s safe to drive with a DSC light.Still, you?re losing a safety feature, so it?s best to get it working the way it should as soon as possible."
Conclusion	"While the DSC system can be a little frustrating when it starts to act up, it can save you from an accident when everything is working the way it should. So, while the little extra cost in sensors now can be frustrating, it?s well worth it in the end."
What Does The Check Engine Light Mean?	"The Check Engine Light means there is something wrong with your engine?s electrical system. It can be due to a faulty engine sensor or any other damaged part in your engine. Mostly it?s due to something wrong with the emissions control system.In 1996, automakers began standardizing all systems with the OBD-II protocol. This system provides a list of diagnostic trouble codes that can be read through a universal connector. The Check Engine Light illuminates when the car?s computer recognizes a problem. It can be orange, amber, or yellow light, depending on the car manufacturer. The Check Engine Light can shine steadily, which indicates there?s an issue that must be checked out. These problems aren?t generally immediate concerns, but you should get right to the mechanic.However, the Check Engine Light that flashes off and on is indicating a critical fault. At this point, you should pull over and have the car towed. Some people confuse the Check Engine Light with the service light. This important indicator has a wrench-like shape and says, ?Service Now? or ?Service Soon.? This light only serves a reminder to get your scheduled maintenance performed and doesn?t indicate an issue."
what are the Causes of Check Engine Light ?	"The most common cause of a check engine light is an issue with the emission control system like a bad oxygen sensor or MAF sensor. It can also be due to issues with the ignition like bad spark plugs or ignition coils. Basically, the check engine light can be caused by any issue with your engine.Because the Check Engine Light is responsible for alerting you to any trouble, it can indicate small issues to major repairs. Here are the five most common reasons this indicator turns on.Remember that a lot more things can cause the light to come on! Check further down how to diagnose it properly!1. Loose Gas CapOpen Fuel Tank CapThe car?s gas cap seals the fuel system, so the tank receives the right amount of pressure. When you don?t apply the gas cap tightly enough or it is damaged, the pressure could be off in the fuel system. Thankfully, this is one of the easiest fixes. You can either secure the gas cap or replace a damaged one for just a few dollars. 2. Failing Oxygen SensorO2 Sensor On CatWhen an oxygen sensor begins to fail, you might also notice a decline in the fuel economy. Many vehicles contain four oxygen sensors, and any of these can fail.Depending on the make and model of your vehicle, the oxygen sensor replacement cost could be around $250. 3. Failing Catalytic ConverterClogged Catalytic ConverterTypically, the catalytic converter fails because you haven?t performed regular maintenance or you ignored other issues. If the spark plugs, wires or oxygen sensor require replacement, you should do it right away, or you could end up with this costly repair.Catalytic converter replacements cost $1,000 or more in most situations. 4. Defective Spark Plugs or WiresSpark Plug MisfiresWhen the spark plugs corrode or wear out, you will notice engine performance issues. It?s also possible that the engine won?t start at all. That?s because this critical part supplies the spark needed for ignition. The spark plug wires are just as critical, supplying the spark created from the coil to the plugs where it can ignite the air-fuel mixture. Both of these parts are replaced as part of a regular tune-up. Check your owner?s manual to follow the manufacturer?s recommendations. 5. Failing Mass Air Flow SensorCleaning Maf SensorThe mass air flow sensor keeps track of how much air enters the engine. Then, it uses these calculations to determine how much fuel needs to mix in. When the MAF sensor starts to go bad, you might notice a drop in fuel economy because the engine can?t run efficiently anymore. For most cars, the mass air flow sensor replacement is only between $100 and $400. "
How to Fix Check Engine Light ?	"1. Buy an OBD ReaderIt isn?t expensive to buy your own OBD code reader. With this handy tool, you can check common engine faults without paying a mechanic.If you don?t want to buy an OBD reader, you can check with your local parts store. Many of the nationwide locations will check the codes for free.2. Scan for Engine CodesUnder the driver?s side dashboard, you will see a trapezoid-shaped port. That?s where you want to plug in the code reader. Make sure the engine and key are off when you plug it in.However, once the scanner is hooked up and on, you want to turn the key to your vehicle on but leave the engine off. Press the scan button and watch the codes that come up. 3. Search the Engine CodeYou can take your code to the internet to find the cause of your fault. At Mechanic Base, we keep our readers informed of the most common trouble codes. If you can?t find the information you need online, consider calling your local dealership for help.4. Replace the Defective PartOnce you know what the problem is, you can purchase the necessary replacement parts and install them. Obviously, some of the repairs are going to cost a lot less than others, such as a replacement gas cap versus a catalytic converter.However, you should never prolong a repair, as it could lead to more serious issues down the road. 5. Erase the CodeOnce everything is fixed, it?s time to erase the codes. Plug your scanner back in and hold down the erase button.You might need to confirm the changes. We recommend rescanning the engine to be sure they are gone. You will also see the Check Engine Light go off.If you are repairing an issue to pass a smog check, take your vehicle for a few drives before getting retested. Many technicians can tell if you have recently deleted a code, so it?s best to drive for at least 50 miles first. "
What does the ABS Light mean?	"An ABS light on your car?s dashboard means there is an issue with the car?s anti-lock braking system. The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) is a safety system that prevents the wheels of a vehicle from locking up when braking and this warning tells you that the system is not working as intended.When you turn on the vehicle?s ignition, you should see the ABS light come on for a second as the system performs diagnostics. After this self-check, the light should turn off.If it doesn?t light up at all, the bulb might have burnt out. On the other hand, if the ABS light doesn?t turn off or it comes on while you are driving, you need to figure out what?s causing the alert."
what are the Causes of the ABS Light ?	"1. Bad Speed SensorAbs Sensor CloseThe wheel speed sensor takes the rate at which the wheels are moving and reports it to the ECU. With this information, the ECU can determine how to use the ABS. If the ECU sees that one of the wheels is moving faster than another, it will push out more brake fluid, allowing the wheel to move at a slower rate to increase grip on the pavement.When the speed sensor stops working, the ECU won?t have accurate data. Not only will this cause the ABS light to come on, but you should also notice that the car can lose traction when you slam on the brakes. In fact, the traction control light might also come on. The speed sensor is mounted very close to the wheels so it can measure how fast they are moving. Because of its location, it endures a lot of damage from being by the brakes and dealing with all of the excessive heat. It can also endure damage from metal shavings or debris coming off of the brakes.2. Bad ABS Tone RingBroken Abs RingThe ABS sensor needs something to read the wheel speed from, and this is the ABS tone ring. Sometimes the ABS ring becomes rusty and cracks, which causes the ABS sensor to give an incorrect measurement, which causes the ABS light to illuminate on your dashboard.Some ABS rings are installed inside the wheel bearing and in that case, you need to replace the entire wheel bearing. However, if it is installed on the driveshafts, you can often inspect it visually to see if you can find any cracks or other damage.3. Defective ABS Module or WiringsAbs Broken WiringIt?s possible for the ABS module to go bad. However, the wiring itself might also be to blame. These wires are subject to corrosion that would cause delays or a lack of communication between the ABS module and speed sensor. It would be better if the car just needed some updated wires. However, you may need to replace the ABS module if you are unlucky, which costs much more.With either problem, you should notice a lack of response with the brakes. At first, you might only notice it periodically, but it should continue getting worse. It?s also possible that the brakes could lock up or you might hear some clicking noises 4. Malfunctioning Hydraulic PumpAbs PumpThe ABS system must control the brake fluid that comes through the hydraulic pump. This pump is responsible for pushing brake fluid through the cylinder, so it?s distributed to the brakes when the brake pedal is pushed down. The ABS system also adjusts the brake pressure to each wheel based on the reading from the speed sensor. With this information, the appropriate amount of fluid can be pumped to the brakes where it is needed the most. In most cases, this system works just as intended. However, the hydraulic pump can fail or you could face a malfunctioning valve in the hydraulic system. Neither of these situations is good. The pump is subject to debris and metal shavings from contaminated brake fluid, it can wear out. However, if you get the fluid changed regularly, you help prevent this situation from occurring.When you have issues with the pump, braking performance becomes disintegrated. It will start out slowly and get worse as you let it go. If the master cylinder fails, the brakes can feel good one minute, but you can lose complete power a second later, making it very dangerous to drive. Additionally, there could be a fluid leak as a result of the defect. If the fluid is seeping out, the pedal can start out firm, but it will get spongy until it sinks down to the floor. 5. Blown FuseThe ABS runs because of the electrical parts of your car. In fact, the ABS runs on its own fuse. These fuses are not immune from failure. For no reason at all, a fuse can blow at any time. Thankfully, it isn?t difficult to check the fuse. In fact, it might be the first step of diagnostics if you aren?t noticing any symptoms other than the light comes on the dashboard. 6. Low Brake FluidThe ABS pump needs brake fluid to work correctly. This fluid is pushed through the cylinder to feed the brake system. If there?s not enough brake fluid, you are going to run into issues, including a possible illuminated ABS light.If the fluid is low, it?s important to figure out why. It?s possible that you have a leaking fluid reservoir, air in the brake system or a seal that is damaged. It can also happen when the brakes are worn. If you allow the system to get too low, the ABS module won?t balance the pressure between each wheel, so there will be slippage and skidding. As the brake fluid continues to get lower, you might also see that it becomes harder to stop. There?s also the chance that more noise will occur when you are braking. "
what is the Diagnose ABS Light ?	"If you want to figure out what needs to be replaced, consider following these steps.Check the ABS fuse. This step only takes a few seconds and it can save you a lot of headaches. It?s located in the fuse panel under the dash. You can find a diagram pointing to the fuse location in your owner?s manual.Check the brake fluid level. If the brake fluid is low, add some more. If it looks contaminated, drain it and refill it. Check the system for leaks. You should be able to see leaking brake fluid from under the car. Fresh fluid has a light yellow color, while contaminated oil will appear slightly darker, even brown.Test the ABS wheel sensor with a voltmeter. You can also read trouble codes with your OBDII scanner that should point out if there?s a fault.If you are having trouble finding the problem, it?s time to take your vehicle to a qualified mechanic for further diagnostics. "
How to Fix ABS Light ?	"You can spend as little as $20 to as much as $1,000 to fix the ABS light, depending on the problem causing it to come on. Let?s take a closer look at the most common repairs to fix the ABS light, but you must perform a complete diagnosis to determine what?s causing your problem before you start replacing parts. After all, there is no reason to put parts on the car that aren?t needed. The cheapest issue would be a blown fuse. Not only should this fix cost you $20 or less, but it?s easy to fix. Simply open the fuse panel and replace the one running the ABS. The next easiest fix will be to add more brake fluid if it is low. This fix only costs you the price of the brake fluid, as long as there are no issues causing a leak. From here, you could replace a faulty speed sensor or a bad ABS tone ring. The average for this repair might be between $100 and $300. This seems to be one of the most common issues with the ABS light. There?s also the chance that you need to replace the ABS module or rewire the system. Fixing the wiring fault might be cheaper, but a new module will probably cost you $200 to $600. The largest of the problems would be to replace the hydraulic pump or a master cylinder. The master cylinder replacement could be between $300 and $600 while putting a new hydraulic pump can easily hit $1,000 or more. "
Can I Drive with the ABS Light On?	"The short answer is yes, but it really depends on your situation. This answer comes with a big warning. The only way you should drive with the ABS light on is if you know there are no issues. You don?t want your normal braking affected or you put yourself at risk. The ABS system will be out of function if the ABS light is on, and therefore it may cause danger if you are not used to driving a car without ABS.Even if the braking system seems to be fine, it could fail at any time if there?s a problem. For that reason, it?s imperative to take the ABS warning light seriously. You don?t want to be left stranded somewhere and you don?t want to cause an accident. We understand the need to save money and we know that all car repairs don?t always show up at the best times financially. However, the cost you will pay if an accident is caused can be immeasurable. Instead of taking chances, we recommend having the ABS codes scanned to find out what the problem is immediately. "
How long can you go with the ABS light on?	"It?s not recommended to drive with an ABS light on at all, especially not if you are not used to driving cars without ABS. But even if you know how to drive cars without ABS, you still want to check what?s causing it. You should take your car to a mechanic as soon as possible to have it diagnosed and repaired."
Can low brake fluid cause ABS light to come on?	"Yes, if the brake fluid level gets low, it?s possible that the ABS pump will lose pressure and the anti-lock brake system (ABS) will go into ?fail-safe? mode. When this happens, the ABS light will come on."
Can I drive without ABS?	"You can drive without ABS, but it is not recommended. Without ABS, your braking ability will be reduced and it will be more difficult to control your vehicle in emergency situations. If you must drive without ABS, be sure to allow extra distance for braking and be extra careful when driving in slippery conditions."
Can a weak battery cause ABS problems?	"A weak battery could cause ABS problems, but it?s not very common. You will more likely find other malfunctions with your car first if your car battery is bad. However, if you?re having ABS issues, it?s worth checking your battery to see if it may be the culprit."
What Does TCS Mean On A Car?	"TCS on a car stands for Traction Control System. The traction control systems detect when the wheels are about to lose traction. When the system detects this, it intervenes by reducing engine power to the wheel. This helps the car to maintain traction and stay on the road.If you see a TCS light on your dashboard, it means there is an issue with the traction control system, which I will now discuss further."
What Does The Traction Control Light mean?	"The traction control light (TCS) illuminates when there is a trouble code stored in the traction control system. The traction control system helps to keep you in control of your vehicle in the event that one or more of your wheels lose traction while you?re driving.This is most common in snowy, icy, or otherwise less than ideal road conditions. Moreover, your driving patterns affect how often you?ll need your traction control system. The more reckless you drive, the more you?ll need traction control to bail you out."
what is the Traction Control System Light (TCS) Function ?	"Your TCS light serves several functions. For starters, it lets you know when the system is active. When you?re driving and the light flashes on and off, it means that your traction control is on. You?ll feel the brakes locking up and releasing as the ABS kicks on and off. If your wheels were slipping, everything is working as it shouldMoreover, the light should turn on and then off when you first turn the key in the ignition. This is a system check, and as long as the light goes away, it means that everything is working the way it should.When you should be worried is when the TSC light doesn?t go away after the system check. If it stays on, it means that your vehicle?s traction control system isn?t working the way it should, or you?ve turned it off.Finally, if the light is flashing randomly as you drive even though your wheels aren?t losing traction, that means you have a serious fault in your system, and you shouldn?t be driving your vehicle until you fix it. Otherwise, you?re risking your ABS randomly applying your brakes as you drive, and this could quickly lead to an accident."
what are the Causes of Traction Control System Light (TCS)?	"The most common cause of a TSC light is that the system is turned off or a faulty wheel speed sensor. But while those are the most common problems, they aren?t the only things that could lead to a TSC light.Below, I?ve highlighted the four most common reasons your vehicle?s TSC light might be on.1. TSC System Turned OffDid you know that you can turn off your vehicle?s traction control? While the specific steps to do it for each vehicle are slightly different, almost every vehicle allows you to do this. While it usually only helps you when you?re trying to drift, it?s one of the most common reasons this light stays on.Look up how to turn your vehicle?s traction control on and off. Give it a shot. If the light goes away, that was your problem. But if it doesn?t, keep reading.2. Faulty Wheel Speed SensorsBy far the most common reason that a vehicle?s traction control system starts acting up is because of a faulty wheel speed sensor. Each of your vehicle?s wheels has a sensor that reports how fast it?s spinning to the ECM.When one or more of those readings doesn?t match what the rest of the wheel speed sensors are reporting, then your traction kicks onto to remedy the situation. But if the wheel speed sensor is offline or reporting faulty readings, your traction control is going to start acting up.3. Faulty Steering Angle SensorAnother critical component in your traction control system is the steering angle sensor. That?s because as your vehicle turns, the outside wheels are going to turn faster than the inside wheels. This is completely normal, and it?s your steering angle sensor that lets your ECM know what?s going on.But if the steering angle sensor reports that you?re still going straight while you?re actually turning, the traction control system will register a fault, and it could kick on while you?re turning.4. Faulty Wiring/Electrical IssuesWhile wiring and electrical issues are less likely than a faulty sensor, it is still a distinct possibility. That?s because even if all the sensors are working correctly, it won?t matter if the wires that transmit that signal are corroded or broken.The most common location for faulty wiring is right by the wheel speed sensor since those wires are often exposed to the elements. Always rule out faulty wiring or deeper electrical issues before dropping a ton of money on new sensors."
Is It Safe To Drive With a Traction Control System Light (TCS) Light?	"It is usually safe to drive with a TSC light ? but it is not advisable to do so. The reason for this is twofold. First, your traction control system is there to help your vehicle maintain traction on slippery road conditions, so you?re losing an important safety feature when it?s not working correctly.Second, depending on the fault in the system, your traction control could kick on while driving. This would mean that your ABS would start applying your brakes as you drive down the road. This is incredibly rare, but it can happen, which is why you should fix the fault as soon as possible."
conclusion	"While your traction control system can seem like a headache when it?s not working the way it should, this innovation has prevented thousands upon thousands of accidents throughout the years. So, while you might be cursing the system now, you?ll be thankful for it when you need it most.Take the time to fix your traction control system if it starts acting up. Chances are you?ll be thankful that you did."
What Does The Reduced Engine Power Warning Mean?	"When the Engine Power Reduced warning appears, it means that the performance of your vehicle is limited. The PCM detects a system failure and alerts the message to illuminate. In conjunction with the warning message, the engine might not act normally.The reduced power can prevent the vehicle from shifting and can stop you from accelerating. In extreme cases, the PCM will restrict fuel to the engine, leaving you with a car that won?t run.Some people refer to this system as the fail-safe mode. However, it?s also known as the limp mode because the warning gives you time to drive home without causing further damage to the engine or transmission. This warning message is very common in Chevy vehicles instead of the normal limp home mode."
what are the Causes of Reduced Engine Power Warning ?	"The reduced engine power warning is often caused by bad engine sensors like a bad oxygen sensor, MAF sensor, or a bad throttle body. It can also be caused by a loose connection to any of these sensors. A clogged catalytic converter is also often to blame.However, the reduced engine power warning can be caused by so many different reasons, and therefore you should never just replace parts you think could be faulty.The easiest and most secure way to determine what is causing the Reduced Engine Power Warning message is by checking the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner. When the message shows up, there is almost always a trouble code stored in the system. This can save you a lot of money by helping you pinpoint which parts need to be repaired or replaced, so you aren?t guessing and maybe replacing perfectly good parts at random.Here are some other ideas of what can cause the reduced engine power warning to come on:1. Loose ConnectionWire ConnectorEvery major component in your vehicle is connected with wires. If there is a short in the electrical system or one of the wires is damaged, the engine could go into a fail-safe mode. This problem can also exist if you have a loose clamp, or a ground wire isn?t properly secured. While a loose connection is simple to repair in most cases, it isn?t always easy to find. You would have to perform a full inspection of the systems to find the defect. 2. Defective Oxygen SensorBad O2 Sensor E1609866265874Oxygen sensors are needed to measure how much O2 is leaving the system by way of the exhaust. If there is too much or too little oxygen coming out, the ECU is going to adjust the air-fuel ratio to balance performance.However, a defective sensor can send faulty information back to the computer, causing adjustments to be made that shouldn?t be. This creates an imbalance in the air-fuel mixture, which not only leads to poor performance and engine issues, but can also trigger the Reduced Engine Power Warning.3. Throttle Body IssuesDirty Throttle BodyThe throttle body contains several parts that can go bad and lead to these warnings. First, the butterfly valve is responsible for letting air into the engine. When this valve breaks, the proper amount of air can?t be delivered into the engine.Carbon can also build up around this valve, leading to issues with the operation. When the engine can?t get enough air, it?s going to misfire and sputter while causing warnings on the dashboard.Not far from the butterfly valve is the throttle position sensor, which must also work properly to allow free movement of the air. This sensor reads the position of the gas pedal, telling the computer to open the butterfly valve. However, if the sensor is faulty, the valve cannot get the appropriate data, and air will be constricted. 4. Malfunctioning ECUEngine Control Unit E1623003106373The Engine Control Unit is the brain of the entire operation. All of the sensors communicate what is going on with the ECU so proper adjustments can be made. If the air-fuel mixture isn?t right, it?s the ECU that alters what?s happening for better performance.However, when the ECU starts to fail, any number of issues can occur. You might start to notice poor performance while the engine compensates for problems that may not even be happening. 5. Failing Mass Airflow SensorMaf Sensor LocationYou will find the mass airflow sensor between the intake manifold and the engine air filter. Its job is to measure the pressure and density of the air that enters the engine. Once these measurements are performed, the information is sent to the ECU so the proper fuel ratio can be applied. When the MAF sensor fails, the wrong data is sent, which creates problems with the ratios and causes warning lights to illuminate. 6. Clogged Catalytic ConverterClogged Catalytic ConverterAfter the exhaust manifold, you will find the catalytic converter. The main purpose of this vital component is to convert dangerous exhaust gases into less harmful contaminants. However, the catalytic converter can become clogged if the engine hasn?t been running properly, or simply as the vehicle ages.Once this happens, the vehicle will not only fail an emissions test, but you will experience some engine performance issues. It won?t always illuminate the Reduced Engine Power Warning, but you can expect the Check Engine Light to come on at a bare minimum. 7. Transmission FailureTransmission Valve BodyTransmission issues are never fun to deal with and can lead to a lot of headaches. If the transmission is slipping or the fluid has become low, you can expect to see some error codes.While people don?t think a reduction in engine power is linked to the transmission, these two systems are intertwined. If none of the other culprits are to blame, it?s time to take a look at the transmission."
what is the Reduced Engine Power Repair Cost ?	"The cost to repair a Reduced Engine Power Warning ranges widely from $0 to $2,500. The only way to know the exact cost would be to determine what?s causing it.Using an engine code scanner should help you narrow down where the fault is. The OBDII scanner will read any fault codes, showing you what systems might be to blame.Ideally, you would notice a loose connection, which wouldn?t cost you anything to fix if you could re-establish the link. However, replacing the catalytic converter or swapping out the ECU could be a costly fix that might lead to your vehicle heading to the junkyard.You should never drive with the Reduced Engine Power Warning light on. If Limp Mode has been activated, you should immediately drive the vehicle to a safe location and turn it off. Turn on your hazard lights to let other drivers know you are having trouble.If you have more than a few miles to drive, it?s recommended that you have the vehicle towed instead. You don?t want to end up stranded on the side of the road or cause an accident because of the lack of power."
How do I fix the engine power reduced warning message?	"To fix the reduced engine power warning message, you must first scan the trouble codes with an OBD scanner. When this warning message appears, it means that there are one or more trouble codes stored in the ECM. The diagnosis will be much easier if you read these codes first."
Can I drive with reduced engine power?	"It?s not recommended to drive with the reduced engine power warning message, as you will not know the severity of the problem until you properly diagnose it. The problem that is causing this error to show up could be a simple fix, but it could also be something serious that could damage your engine even more if you continue to drive without resolving it."
Is reduced engine power serious?	"The reduced engine power light can be both serious and non-serious depending on what is causing it. It could be something as simple as low battery capacity, but it could also be an internal engine problem that gets worse and more expensive if you ignore the problem."
Can low oil cause reduced engine power?	"Yes. Low oil can cause a reduced engine power warning message. Low oil can lead to low oil pressure which can negatively affect the engine in many possible ways. In the worst case, it can also lead to serious engine damage if you do not fix the problem as soon as possible"
Can a reduced engine power be a battery problem?	"Yes. The reduced engine power message can be caused by a bad car battery. Modern cars are very sensitive to the correct battery power, and if it is too low, it can lead to many different electrical problems with your car. However, don?t just replace the battery without diagnosing it first, because many problems can cause this warning message."
Conclusion	"The reduced engine power message means that there is a problem with your engine or transmission and that there is a trouble code stored in the engine control module. There are many things that can cause this warning message.Therefore, it is very important to read the trouble codes with a compatible diagnostic scanner before replacing any parts in an attempt to solve the problem. This message means that your engine has entered a safe mode to prevent further engine damage, so it is never wise to ignore it."
What Does O/D Off Mean In A Car?	"O/D stands for overdrive, and O/D Off means that the overdrive system is deactivated. This feature is present in many of today?s vehicles with an automatic transmission. Overdrive is a gear that helps reduce stress on the motor by reducing the RPMs.When overdrive is off, the engine can produce additional power in a lower gear. When it?s activated, the vehicle can withstand a higher speed with lower RPMs. This function creates less engine noise and increases fuel efficiency. It also leads to less wear on the vehicle. When the O/D Off display is lit, the overdrive gear has been turned off, meaning the torque converter isn?t locked. The overdrive gear is not currently engaged, so the RPMs are going to rise higher. However, it only takes the push of a button to reactivate the overdrive gear. "
When to Use Overdrive ?	"1. Driving Highway SpeedsOverdrive is a vital part of the equation when you are driving on wide-open roads. If you are traveling on highways maintaining a consistently high speed, overdrive helps you maximize the engine?s efficiency.Allowing your car to hit the top gear will keep the RPMs to a minimum. You will gain less engine noise on top of pushing the fuel economy to its maximum. 2. Everyday DrivingThe overdrive function should be on in the majority of driving situations. Even though lots of people online will tell you that you need to tell the transmission what to do, this isn?t generally the case.In fact, new cars have a lot of technology included to optimize operation. The transmission and its computer know in most cases when to shift without any input from you. "
When to Turn Off Overdrive ?	"1. Hauling/TowingIf you have a heavy load in your vehicle or you are towing, it might be time to turn off overdrive. By allowing the transmission to hit the highest gear, you could find the vehicle struggling. This problem might be more prevalent when going up hills or steep inclines.In fact, most car manufacturers recommend turning the overdrive off while towing. If in doubt, follow the advice given in the owner?s manual. 2. Erratic ShiftingIn most cases, the transmission should shift smoothly without a problem. However, if you notice the transmission is continually shifting between the top gear and the one below it, you might want to turn it off.Allowing the vehicle to do this continuously is damaging to the transmission. In most cases, you will only notice it when the car is attempting to gain speed, such as when you are going up a hill. Turn overdrive back on as soon as you hit the level ground again. 3. Overtake Another CarWhen you turn the overdrive off, the transmission is forced to shift down. When the gear drops, the RPMs increase, giving you more power to increase speed.You could overtake other cars to pass with overdrive turned on. However, having it off helps the car to be more responsive and forceful, thereby cutting down the amount of time needed. 4. Engine BrakingWhether you need to come to a stop or you are heading downhill, you can use more than your brakes to slow down. The engine is capable of slowing the car down by increasing the RPMs. Some people will argue that engine braking is bad for your vehicle, but there?s no proof that is true when used correctly. If your brakes are getting hot, it might be better for your car to rely on the engine for a little. "
How to Turn Off Overdrive ?	"The majority of today?s cars have an overdrive button located on the gear shifter. In many cases, it won?t be labeled as the overdrive button. Sometimes, there?s a sign of a vehicle traveling on a hill. Find the overdrive button on your gear shifter. It should be on the left-hand side.Push the button in when you want to turn overdrive off. You should see an O/D off symbol on the dashboard when you are successful. Push the button again to turn the overdrive on.However, there are some cars that don?t have the overdrive button. In these cars, you just need to move the gear shifter to the next gear down. This creates the same effect, otherwise known as manual shifting. "
Is It Okay to Leave the Automatic Car in Overdrive All The Time?	"In today?s automatic vehicles, overdrive is automatically activated once your car reaches a certain speed, unless you turn it off. When you aren?t traveling at highway speeds, the car won?t go into overdrive. Therefore, it?s only going to be used when it is needed.You want to leave the car in overdrive in normal driving circumstances. What you don?t want to do is drive your vehicle every day with overdrive turned off. While this isn?t proven to be dangerous to the engine or transmission, it doesn?t provide the driving dynamics you are looking for. With overdrive off, you will use up more fuel than what?s needed and you will notice more engine noise because of the higher RPMs. Unless you have a purpose for turning overdrive off, it?s best to leave it alone, allowing the transmission to do its job. "
How do airbags work?	"So before we look at how to reset the airbag light, you should know how the whole system works.Airbags are lifesavers when you are speeding and hit another car head-on or hit a stationary object. If you do not have an airbag, you could hit your head hard on the steering wheel or dashboard. When you hit something at high speed, your car will decelerate, and this will activate an accelerometer that triggers the airbag circuit.The airbag circuit has a heating element activated through an electric current. This heating element promotes an explosion inside the airbag that rapidly generates a harmless gas. Most airbags use sodium azide as the explosive element, and the gas produced can either be argon or nitrogen. This gas floods the airbag and causes it to expand; hence, protecting the driver from injuries by occupying the steering wheel and the side. The airbag acts as a cushion."
How to reset the airbag light with a scanner ?	"Now that we know how airbags operate, it is time to learn how to reset the airbag light.All work done to the airbag system should be done by professionals if you are not 100% sure of what you are doing! Follow these steps to reset the airbag light:Total Time: 1 hourStep 1: Check the passenger airbag switchAirbag SwitchSome cars have a ?passenger seat Airbag on/off button.? This is the first thing you should check when you want to remove the airbag light. Maybe someone before you turned it to ?Off? by mistake ? this will make the airbag light stay on in most cars.This button is usually on the dashboard on the passenger side, and you may see it if you open the passenger door or the glove box.Step 2: Read the trouble codes with an OBD2 ScannerCar Trouble CodesWorking with your airbag system is crucial. You should always read the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner to get an idea of where to start your troubleshooting. Never clear the trouble codes before you fix the problem caused by the airbag light. Read the codes and get information about what can cause the problem and continue the diagnosis.Step 3: Repair the faultRepair Airbag ClockspringYou should never just reset the airbag light without repairing the problem. This can deploy the airbags or prevent them from functioning if an accident occurs. Let a professional replace the airbag?s parts if you are not sure how to do it. Remember always to remove the battery connection when working with airbags. The airbag light will often go away by itself after repairing the problem, but not in all car models.Step 4: Clear the trouble codesClear Trouble CodesAfter you have installed the new parts and are 100% sure that the parts are installed correctly, it?s time to reset the engine light. To do this, you need to use an OBD2 scanner. There is no other way to reset. Reset the airbag light and make sure that it has disappeared from the dashboard. If it is still there, reread the codes and check for any trouble codes.Step 5: Restart your car & test-drive.Drive CarIf the airbag light seems to have gone away from your dashboard, restart your ignition and go for a test drive. If the airbag light is gone after a test drive, there is a big chance that the problem has been solved. If the problem comes back, reread the codes and continue the procedure."
How to reset the airbag light without a scanner ?	"It is impossible in most car models to reset the airbag light without a scanner. This is for safety reasons, because you should always repair the fault after the airbag light has come on. Luckily, in many car models, the airbag light will also go away by itself if you have repaired the problem.In some older cars, though, it is possible to reset the airbag light without a scanner by removing the car battery terminals.Check the wiring system underneath the driver or passenger seat for any loose wires or corrosion in the connector plug. Spray the connector plugs with an electronic cleaner and restart your car.If you can not find any problems there, you should really get an OBD2 scanner or let a workshop read the codes; otherwise, you will be taking a stab in the dark when you try to guess the problem."
What happens if you pull the airbag fuse?	"If you pull the fuse to the airbag control module, it will disable the airbag function in your car after 1-2 minutes. However, it won?t remove the airbag light as you might expect. If the dash does not receive a signal from the airbag module, it will illuminate the airbag warning light."
How can I bypass the airbag light?	"You can bypass the airbag light or the airbag parts by bridging them with resistors. However, we strongly recommend fixing the issues instead, because if you?re in a serious accident, you?ll probably wish the airbag function was working."
How much does it cost to reset the airbag light?	"Resetting the airbag light can cost anywhere from $0 to $1000. It all depends on what is causing the airbag light. If the problem was only temporary, it might be enough to simply reset the codes, which can be done for free. It can also be caused by an expensive faulty part like the steering angle sensor, which can cost you over $1000."
Does disconnecting the battery disable the airbag?	"Yes and no. Airbag systems have large capacitors that will store energy in the system for a while even if you remove the battery cable. However, this energy is often drained within minutes."
Conclusion	"To reset an airbag or SRS light, you need to use a diagnostic scanner to clear the codes after you repair the issue. In most modern cars, there is no way to reset the airbag light without a scanner.If you clear the codes, but the airbag light keeps coming back on, there is a problem that needs to be fixed first. You should never attempt to reset the airbag light without correcting the problem first, because this could cause the airbags to deploy.Now you know how to handle the airbag light. You may understand the safety importance when working on airbags or SRS systems in a car. If you feel that you don?t have the knowledge to work on airbag systems, take it to a mechanic and have them run a diagnostic test."
What is StabiliTrak? 	"GM patented its own electronic stability control (ESC) system, known as StabiliTrak. This ESC system is designed to stop wheels from slipping by reducing engine power during low-traction situations. However, other auto manufacturers have a similar system with a different name. Even though there won?t be a StabiliTrak warning on a vehicle outside of the Chevrolet and GM vehicle lineup, many of the same principles exist across the board. "
What Does Service StabiliTrak Mean?	"The Service StabiliTrak message means that there is an issue with your Chevy?s StabiliTrak system. This generally occurs when a sensor detects issues with the wheel location or the reaction to steering. If everything is operating as it should, the system will respond to the understeer or oversteer automatically. When it?s working correctly, safety and vehicle stability is improved for occupants, especially when traveling on slippery surfaces. If a sensor fails, you will receive an alert that there?s a fault. While the warning is illuminated, the traction control system is not operating as it should. This isn?t a dangerous situation in most cases, but you still want to have the fault repaired. "
what are the Possible Causes of Service StabiliTrak Message ?	"The Service StabiliTrak message is usually caused by a problem with the traction control system, brake components, or steering wheel system. A faulty ABS sensor, throttle sensor, or a bad steering angle sensor are some of the most common causes.The StabiliTrak system runs through the traction control system, ABS brake system components and steering wheel. However, there are aspects beyond these systems that could cause the malfunction.The most common causes of a Service StabiliTrak message include:There are many issues that could lead to the StabiliTrak light coming on. The most common complaints have to do with a bad sensor, where the system can?t receive the information it needs, causing it to shut down. A code scanner will be able to give you a fault code that tells you which sensor is failing so that you can resolve the issue quickly. The most unusual problem is the use of E85 fuel, but it?s been noted many times by drivers. When conventional gasoline is added back into the tank, the StabiliTrak light and check engine light seem to go off by itself, so it?s always something to consider, especially if you just visited the gas pump and there are no obvious trouble codes present.It?s also possible that a bad fuel pump is causing the issue, even though the StabiliTrak isn?t part of the fuel system. For this reason, it?s important to monitor all of the symptoms that the car is exhibiting to make a proper diagnosis. If there are other things going wrong at the same time, it will be much easier to diagnose. You do also want to look for technical service bulletins. You will find some published for GM vehicles, such as Chevrolet Volt and Buick Envision."
How to Reset Service StabiliTrak Message ?	"If the Service StabiliTrak warning light has come on the dashboard, you should take heed that there?s something wrong with the system. There could be a computer failure or software malfunction turning the system off. Before you try to turn off the warning light, you want to run a full diagnostic of the system to find the fault. Warning lights are meant to alert you to danger. Once the diagnostics are completed and you know how to resolve the problem, you are ready to reset the warning light.Here are some general guidelines on how to reset the Service StabiliTrak Message:Check the StabiliTrak button. If it has been pushed in manually, the light will remain on. Consider the weather systems and road conditions. If there?s a reason for the system to be disabled automatically, that could be why the warning light is on. Rotate the steering wheel clockwise. If the light turns off, there?s probably nothing wrong with the StabiliTrak system. If the light remains on, continue with the following steps. Shut down the vehicle. Walk away and do something else for about 15 minutes. This time gives the system a chance to reset.Restart the vehicle. If the message is gone, you don?t need to service the vehicle. Otherwise, it?s time for complete diagnostics. If the Service StabiliTrak light persists, there could be several faults with the system. It could be caused by a defective input sensor or a malfunctioning controller. It?s also possible that there is simply a bad connection in the system that needs to be re-established. You might spend, on average, $200 to $550 to repair a Service StabiliTrak warning, depending on what?s causing the fault. If you aren?t sure how to proceed, get the car diagnosed through a mechanic that understands the GM technology. "
Can I Keep Driving with the StabiliTrak Light On?	"If you?ve chosen to turn StabiliTrak off, there?s nothing wrong with the system and you are free to drive as needed. Just be aware that having the system disabled means that there will be no traction control, meaning that you could notice the tires spinning and skidding in slippery situations. Drive accordingly to prevent any accidents.However, if StabiliTrak is turned off because of a fault, you need to have it looked at. Only after the trouble codes are diagnosed should you determine if driving would be safe. In some conditions, you can wait to get the repair ? as long as you are comfortable driving without traction control. With that said, some of the causes are going to lead to other problems. If the reason the StabiliTrak is malfunctioning is also causing other concerns, it?s best to have the fault repaired. "
Does StabiliTrak affect transmission?	"Yes. StabiliTrak can affect transmission. When the system is activated, it applies forces to the wheels in order to help keep the car stable. This can create resistance and drag that can impact how well the wheels rotate and, as a result, how well the car moves."
What are the symptoms of a bad StabiliTrak system?	"A bad StabiliTrak system can cause a StabiliTrak error message on your dashboard, and it can cause the car to veer off course or skid on slippery surfaces. If you experience any of these symptoms, it?s important to take your car in for service right away."
Is StabiliTrak covered under warranty?	"No. StabiliTrak is usually not covered under warranty. However, it really depends on your car?s make and model, as well as the type of warranty you have. It?s always best to check with your manufacturer or dealer to see what exactly is covered under your warranty."
Will StabiliTrak keep car from starting?	"No. The StabiliTrak system itself should not prevent your car from starting. However, there could be a major electronic problem with your car that is causing both the starting problems and the StabiliTrak problems."
what are the Causes of Battery Light On While Driving ?	"The most common reason for a battery light on while driving is a broken auxiliary or serpentine belt. It can also be because of a faulty or worn alternator, or the wirings to it. In rare cases, a faulty dash cluster or a bad car battery is to blame.There are actually quite a lot of things that can cause your battery light to come on. While these are just some of the most common ones, there are many more. Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of why your battery warning light is on while driving.1. Broken Auxiliary Drive belt (Serpentine Belt) Serpentine Belt ComponentsThis is by far the most common reason for your battery light to illuminate whilst your driving. If your auxiliary drive belt has broken, then it?s no longer able to spin your alternator, meaning there is no electrical charge being generated in which to charge your battery. Your vehicle is smart enough to recognize this as a fault and tell you through the battery light.If your belt has snapped, you will usually also notice a couple of other symptoms to indicate this, such as loss of power steering and loss of air conditioning. The process for diagnosing this fault couldn?t be simpler. Simply carry out a visual inspection on the engine, and it should be immediately obvious if your belt has snapped. As long as your vehicle hasn?t been driven for a prolonged amount of time without a belt, you should be able to get away with just replacing it and driving as normal.Top Tip: Make sure you remove ALL debris from the old belt that may have gotten lodged in various parts of your engine bay, as this could cause you problems down the road if it gets caught in pulleys or cooling fans. You can find more information about how to diagnose it here: Serpentine belt symptoms2. Faulty Alternator Alternator LocationIf your serpentine belt seems to be fine, the next component to look at is your vehicle?s alternator. Your alternator is a fairly complex unit with multiple internal components that could go wrong. From faulty diodes to broken windings, they will all cause your alternator to stop charging at the current rate that your vehicle requires. This is quite a technical diagnosing process, however, if you?re not comfortable working with electrics on a running engine, then take your vehicle to a local garage. They will often have a specialized tester that will be able to easily diagnose your alternator for you at a small fee. You can find more information about how to diagnose and check your alternator here: Alternator symptoms3. Broken Alternator to Dash Cluster Wire Alternator Cluster WireThis is a fault that can be a bit more tricky to determine, but I have seen it happen many times. The wire that feeds your dash cluster is often only a small 15 amp cable, making it prone to wear and corrosion. This wire will often be connected to the alternator via a standard block connector and will then run either directly to your dash cluster, or it will run through an ECU. The easiest way to determine this fault is the process of elimination. Have your battery and alternator tested to make sure that they?re both operating as they should be. If no fault is found with these, then you will need to check this wire next. Carry out a visual inspection on the block connector fitted on the alternator?s back and make sure a good connection is visible. Next, carry out a visual inspection on the actual wire to check for corrosion or breaks in the cable. If any are found, repair and run your vehicle to make sure the battery light extinguishes after starting.4. Faulty dash cluster Instrument ClusterAlthough this fault lies towards the more uncommon end of the list, it still happens frequently enough to make it onto here. Usually, with a faulty dash cluster, you will also notice other faults such as faulty odometer readings or other warning lights that are one when they shouldn?t be.In order to determine if your dash cluster is faulty or not, you will usually have to have it bench tested by a specialist. 5. Faulty Battery Car Battery ChargerAnother common problem that would be indicated by your battery light illuminating whilst you?re driving is that your battery may be faulty. A shorted cell in your battery could prevent it from accepting the electrical feed from your alternator, thereby stopping it from being charged. This fault may also be shown by your vehicle being slow to start, especially on colder mornings. In order to diagnose this fault, you will need to take your battery to get tested. A simple multimeter will not always indicate a shorted cell within a battery. Most garages will have an appropriate battery tester, however, and will carry out the test for a small fee. 6. Corroded Battery Terminals Corrosion Battery TerminalCorroded/ loose battery terminals can cause a whole range of peculiar faults on your vehicle. Although it?s unlikely, it?s possible that this will cause your battery light to come on while you?re driving.Carry out a visual check on the battery terminals to check for corrosion and to ensure the connections are tight. Top Tip: Spray a small amount of clear grease onto your battery terminals to help prevent the build-up of corrosion. 7. Broken/ Corroded Engine Earth Strap Car Ground StrapSimilar to the loose/ corroded battery connections, a broken or corroded earth strap can also cause a whole range of strange faults on your vehicle. It?s a very uncommon but not unheard of fault that?s actually quite easy to check for.  You can often find one between the body and the engine,and one between the car battery negative terminal to the body.Simply carry out a visual inspection of your vehicle?s earthing straps and check for any breaks or tears. At either end of the straps, it?s important that you check for a build-up of corrosion, as this could cause a poor earth connection. Top Tip: Remove fixing bolts and clean up the contact points with a fine piece of emery paper to ensure a good connection. Then, refit the strap and fully torque the fixing bolts. 8. Worn Alternator PulleyAlternator Pulley ClutchThis is a fault that is uncommon on most cars but quite a common occurrence on the German car models. Some of these alternators feature a specially designed pulley that is designed to only spin one way. While this design is great for preventing damage to the alternator; it can be an awkward fault when it goes wrong. To diagnose, simply remove your auxiliary drive belt and try manually turning your alternator pulley hand. It should spin freely in the direction of rotation. If not, then the pulley will need replacing; this can often be done without replacing the whole alternator assembly."
Conclusion	"If your battery light illuminates whilst you?re driving, just be aware that your vehicle won?t run for very long, depending on battery health and what accessories you have switched on. Pull over as soon as it?s safe to do so and have your vehicle towed home or to a garage, because by continuing to drive, you run the risk of causing further damage to your engine. It?s important to have your battery regularly tested, as it can lower the chance you get caught out with a fault such as this. I hope this list can be of some great help for you, so please feel free to refer back to it when you need to."
What Is The Honda Oil Life Percentage Indicator?	"The Honda Oil Life Percentage Indicator tells drivers when the oil quality has degraded and requires a change. It counts down the percentage of the oil quality, meaning that 100% is completely new oil. As it hits drastically lower quality levels, a light comes on, indicating it?s time to change the oil. Getting regular oil changes is essential to keeping the engine running its best. In general, people can keep track of the mileage to determine when it?s time again, but many people overlook the maintenance because they become busy. With the Honda Oil Life Indicator, drivers are reminded when the time is drawing near, ensuring that it never gets overlooked again. Instead of relying on the odometer reading and date, the indicator lets you know when service is required. The Honda Oil Light doesn?t just run on mileage. It also evaluates the current condition of the oil, ensuring that changes are only performed when the time is right. "
How Accurate is the Honda Oil Life Percentage?	"Honda isn?t using a new algorithm to determine when the oil needs to be changed. In fact, it?s very similar to the other systems that are offered by some of the top car manufacturers.This Oil Life Monitor remains fairly accurate and is often more conservative than it needs to be. Therefore, if the regular oil changes are set up for 7,000 miles and the indicator is saying you can go longer, it?s probably just due to you changing the way you drive or where you are traveling. If you?ve moved from driving in the city to spending more time on the highway, the mileage could easily be extended.However, there are also times when the system gets reset. When this happens, it could believe that you recently got an oil change even though you didn?t. This could cause the system to become inaccurate.On the plus side, when the system works, it can help you save a lot of money. For example, if your car should have the oil changed every 5,000 miles, it doesn?t mean that it always needs one at that time. By blinding changing the oil by mileage, you could be getting rid of perfectly good oil that could have gone longer. This costs you more in the long run and forces you to spend more time on car maintenance than necessary. With the maintenance minder systems, the mileage isn?t the only factor, ensuring that the oil only gets changed when it actually needs it. "
How to Reset Honda Oil Life Percentage ?	"The steps to reset the oil life percentage system will vary based on what year and model you drive. You can find the specific directions in your car owner?s manual. However, here are a few basic steps to follow.Turn the key in the ignition to the ON position. Don?t start the engine.There?s either a knob on the dash or a button on the steering wheel that allows you to Select/Reset. Push this button and scroll or select the options until you get to ?Engine Oil Indicator %? or ?Engine Oil Life.?Hold the Select/Reset button down for ten seconds. You should see the Engine Oil Percentage Indicator blinking. Once the display shows ?Engine Oil Life,? you want to push the Info Button to enter Reset Mode.After you enter Reset mode, you can once again push the Select/Reset button and the engine oil life should return to 100%, indicating that you just had an oil change.You only need to know how to do this if you perform your own Honda oil changes. If you take your vehicle to the dealership for maintenance and service, the technicians will reset it as part of the appointment. If they don?t, you can take it back and have them do it."
differences between Oil Pressure Indicator and Oil Life Percentage ?	"Many people get confused between the Oil Life Percentage and Oil Pressure Indicator. These two symbols are very different, even though they both deal with oil. While the Oil Life Percentage Indicator helps you know when it?s time for maintenance, the Oil Pressure Indicator tells you there is a problem.This warning light features a red icon, similar to what a leaking oil can might look like. This light should never come on with the motor running. If the light starts flashing, the system is trying to tell you that the pressure has dropped low. If it goes off, the system has recovered. However, when the light stays lit, there is a loss of oil pressure that must be dealt with immediately. You must stop driving right away before severe engine damage occurs."
What does the VSC Light mean?	"The Check VSC System Warning or VSC light indicates that there is a problem with your traction control system, and your VSC and ABS systems will be temporarily disabled. It may also appear if you accidentally pressed the VSC button.VSC stands for vehicle stability control, and it is Toyota?s and Lexus? systems for handling traction control. Traction control helps your car to maintain its grip by reducing the engine power sent to the wheels and sometimes even applying brake force through the ABS system.VSC works together with ABS and other control modules. If you see the ?VSC OFF? warning light on your dashboard, it means that the traction control is completely disabled and the traction control will not work if you lose grip. If you have a newer Toyota or Lexus car, you may also see a ?Check VSC system Light? message on your dashboard instead of the regular VSC light."
What causes the check VSC system light?	"The most common cause of a VSC light is engine problems. If this is the case, you?ll see the VSC light along with a check engine light on your dashboard. It can also be caused by ABS problems such as a faulty ABS sensor or bad wiring.Since the VSC system is integrated with the engine management and brake control system to control your car?s traction, there are quite a lot of things that could go wrong. Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of a VSC warning light:1. Engine issuesEngine IssuesThe most common reason for the VSC light to come on is due to an engine problem. This is especially true if you also see a Check Engine light on your dashboard along with the VSC light.Modern engines have many different sensors, actuators and other parts that can result in a check light, which will also result in a VSC light if you have a Toyota or Lexus. Therefore, it won?t be possible to just guess what causes it.When the check engine light and VSC light illuminate on your dashboard, there will be a trouble code stored in the engine control module. You need to read this trouble code to find out what is causing the warning lights.Some of the common engine issues that could cause a VSC light are:However, there are many different parts that can cause this problem as well, so that being said, it?s important to read the codes with a scanner first if you see both warning lights on your dash.2. Faulty ABS SensorAbs Sensor CloseThe ABS sensors are located at each of your car?s wheels to measure wheel speed. It is not only the ABS control module that uses this information but also other important control modules such as the ECM and TCM.These ABS sensors are located at the wheel spindle hubs and are therefore also very exposed to water, rust and dirt and are therefore prone to failure.Because the VSC system uses this information, it will display a VSC light on your dashboard if there is a problem with an ABS sensor. It is also possible that there is a problem with the ABS reluctor rings from which the sensors measure the speed. It could also be a wiring problem between the sensors and the ABS control module.The steering angle sensor is also used by both the ABS system and the VSC system, and if this sensor gives the wrong signal to these control modules, it will turn on the VSC light.3. Faulty Brake Light SwitchBrake Light SwitchThe brake light switch or brake pedal switch is located on your brake pedal. Its job is not only to turn on the brake lights when you press the brake pedal, but also to provide information to many control modules when you press the pedal.One of the systems that use this information is the VSC system, and if there is something wrong with the brake light switch, it will store a fault code and turn on the VSC light on your dash.4. Wiring IssuesBroken WiringsModern cars come with a lot of electronics, and all these electronics need wiring. This is also why wiring problems have become a fairly common problem on modern car models. Unfortunately, wiring problems can be quite difficult to diagnose without the right skills and knowledge.So if you?ve checked everything else, it might be a good idea to talk to a professional if you think there?s a wiring problem with your car.5. Pushed VSC Button by mistakeTraction Control OffIn most car models with a VSC system, there is also a button to switch off the VSC system. There?s always the possibility that you?ve pressed this button by mistake, so you?ll want to double-check this before jumping to any conclusions.However, if the button is pressed, you will more likely see a VSC OFF light instead of a normal VSC warning light. Learn more about when to use the VSC button.Which car models use the VSC system?The VSC system is Toyota?s traction system. However, you will also find it in many Lexus cars. Here are some models with the VSC System:Toyota CamryToyota AvensisToyota VersoToyota SiennaLexus RX400HLexus is250Lexus is220d"
How to fix the VSC light?	"To fix the VSC light, you need to read the trouble codes with a scanner to find out what is causing the warning light to come on. You can also check the brake lights and brake fluid level.Here are a few more detailed steps on how to fix the VSC light:1. Read trouble codesDiagnose CarBecause of the variety of problems that can cause a VSC light, you must always scan the fault codes from the engine control module, ABS control module, and other related control modules before doing anything else.Modern cars have advanced diagnostic software, which will diagnose and tell you if there is a problem with an engine sensor or an ABS sensor. That?s good, because it means you don?t have to measure and diagnose every sensor in your car if there?s something wrong. This information can be read with an OBD2 scanner.To read the engine control module, you can use almost any scanner on the market. However, to read the ABS control module, you may need a special scanner for your car model.You can try reading the codes with a less expensive scanner, or you can go to an auto shop and have them read the ABS codes for you if you couldn?t find a problem in the engine control module.2. Check Brake LightsBrake LightsThe brake light switch is a common part that can cause the VSC light to come on. Therefore, checking the brake lights can be a simple and quick solution.Have a friend or family member press the brake pedal with the ignition on, while you check to see if the brake lights are working. Unfortunately, some brake light switches use two different currents inside them, and even if the brake lights work, it could be a problem with the switch.But if there are no brake lights on your car, it?s definitely time to take a closer look at the brake light switch.3. Check The Gas CapCar Leaking Gas CapA common cause of the VSC light on Lexus and Toyota if you see it along with a TRAC OFF light and a check engine light is a leaking or loose gas cap. If the VSC light came on after you refueled your car, you definitely want to make sure the gas cap is properly tightened.It can also occur if you leave your car running with the gas cap off when refueling the car. If so, simply clearing the code memory may be enough to fix the VSC light. However, you will want to inspect the O-ring on the gas cap and make sure it is sealing properly and not leaking.4. Check The Brake Fluid LevelBrake FluidAnother quick fix is to check the brake fluid level. Low brake fluid can cause many different problems with the ABS system, which can also result in VSC system failure.Therefore, you want to check the brake fluid reservoir and make sure the level is not too low. If it is very low, you need to inspect for any brake fluid leaking around the brakes, and then refill the reservoir.5. Talk to a professionalTalk To A MechanicIf you?ve tried everything above and still can?t figure out what?s causing the problem, it might be a good idea to get help from a professional. It can cost a lot of money to take the car to a mechanic to diagnose the problem. However, it can be a quick process as many mechanics have dealt with the same problem many times before and will solve the problem quickly."
How to reset the VSC light?	"There is a simple solution to try to reset the VSC light. Maybe it was just an intermittent problem that caused the VSC light to come on. To reset your VSC light, try the following:Stop your car and put the gear in Park.Locate the VSC button. It?s often near the gear stick, but it can also be by your steering wheel or behind it, depending on your car model.Press and hold the VSC button for a few seconds.You will now see that the TRAC OFF and VSC OFF indicator lights will come on. Both the traction and VSC system are now off.Press the VSC button again for a second. Both the TRAC and VSC lights will turn off, and the systems are now re-engaged.If this doesn?t work, you need to check the error codes and do some real diagnosis to find the problem. Take your car to a workshop if you don?t have the knowledge to do it yourself."
Where is the VSC button located?	"The VSC button is usually located under the steering wheel on the left or near the gear lever on both the Toyota and Lexus. Some cars have the text VSC on the button, but some models just have a skidding car symbol."
Can I drive with the VSC light on?	"In general, it is safe to drive with the VSC light on, and your car will run fine if you drive carefully. However, you should be extra careful because the car?s traction control system will be disabled. Therefore, it?s recommended to fix it as soon as possible."
How much does it cost to fix the VSC system?	"Fixing a VSC system can cost anywhere from $50 to $2000 because there can be many reasons why your VSC system is not working. For example, if a bad ABS sensor causes it, it could cost $250. But if it?s a broken throttle body, you could easily spend over $1000."
How do I clear my VSC light?	"Sometimes you can reset the VSC light by disconnecting and re-engaging the VSC system by pressing the VSC button. But sometimes you need an OBD2 scanner for the job, and most of the time there?s a problem you need to fix before you can clear the codes."
Conclusion	"The VSC light indicates that there is a problem with your traction control system and that the VSC system and traction control system will be deactivated until you fix the issue.The VSC system works together with many other systems in your car model, and therefore many different problems can cause the VSC light to come on. Therefore, it is also particularly important to start the diagnosis from the right place and read the codes from all control modules.I hope this article helped you, and if you read through it all, you should now have the knowledge to fix the VSC light on your dash.

Is It Safe to Drive with the Airbag Light On?	"No. It?s not safe to drive with the airbag light on. When the airbag light illuminates, it means that there is a problem with the system. Most likely, the airbag will not deploy in an accident because of this fault. Therefore, it is not recommended that you drive the car until you have the system repaired. You should never ignore this vital warning. While it doesn?t mean the car is unsafe to drive, there?s no reason to take chances with it. However, the light does indicate that the SRS components are not working as they should. This could also mean that the airbags won?t deploy if an accident occurs. You don?t want to wait until you are in an accident to find out if the airbags will protect you. "
What is the SRS Airbag Light?	"The Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) controls the car?s airbags. It?s designed to work with the seatbelts to provide another level of in-vehicle safety. The SRS sensors monitor all of the airbags in your vehicle, which could total ten or more in the newest models.The job of the sensors is to detect when a collision occurs so the airbags can deploy and reduce the impact. However, the sensors also determine if there is a fault in the system, which causes the airbag light to illuminate on the dashboard. "
Is it Illegal to Drive with the Airbag Light On?	"While it isn?t wise to drive with the airbag light on, you can?t get into criminal trouble for doing so. Local and state laws have no bearing on whether you are allowed to drive with dashboard lights on your car.However, you might have trouble getting the car to pass a state inspection with these lights on. In fact, many states will fail a vehicle for having the SRS light, Check Engine Light or ABS light illuminated. "
Will the Airbag Deploy with the SRS Light On?	"When the airbag warning light is on, it?s safe to assume that the airbags are not going to deploy in an accident. When the system detects a fault, it deactivates the airbags for your protection. For this reason, you won?t have to worry about the airbags deploying spontaneously because of the failure. To ensure your on-road protection, it?s critical that you have the light looked at right away."
Common Reasons Airbag Light is On ?	"1. Dead Backup BatteryThe airbag operates with the help of a backup battery. If your automotive battery died recently, it?s also possible that the power to the backup battery is dead.Once you charge the car battery, the backup might start working again, causing the light to go off. Otherwise, it needs to be replaced and the sensors need to be reset. 2. Faulty SensorThe sensors are needed to determine if a crash is occurring, so the airbags can deploy. However, these sensors can also fail because of old age or wear. When the sensors stop working correctly, the system detects a fault and the light comes on. You will need to have the sensors checked, and the system needs a reset to work properly again.3. Damaged Clock SpringThere is a clock spring with the airbag that maintains the continuity of the driver?s side airbag with the electrical wiring. The clock spring is built into the steering wheel and moves with the turns. Over time, it can become worn out, leading to a bad connection and airbag failure. To repair it, the clock spring must be replaced, and the SRS needs to be reset. 4. Water DamageIf your vehicle has become a victim of water damage, anything electrical could be damaged, including the airbag module. This valuable part is located below your seats.When it becomes shorted or corroded, it will stop working, leading to the light coming on. While you can replace the damaged part, it will only happen again unless you stop water from infiltrating the vehicle. "
Cost to Repair Airbag Light ?	"The cost to repair the airbag light depends on what fault has occurred. If the airbag in the steering wheel needs to be replaced for some reason, you could spend $1,100 to $1,500, mainly for the labor involved. However, replacing the clock spring should only cost $250 to $350, or less if you can repair it yourself.The average cost to replace an airbag sensor is between $350 and $450, with the parts averaging around $300. Because the codes will need to be reset, it?s best to have a mechanic perform the fix unless you have an advanced code scanner."
Will the Check engine light reset itself?	"The check engine light probably won?t reset itself unless you fix the problem. However, if you fix the problem, it may reset itself ? but it may take some time. A car usually needs 10-20 successful cycles before it resets the check engine light.A cycle is when you start your car cold and drive it until it is warm and then switch off the engine and are done with your driving.If you are sure that you have fixed the problem causing the check engine light, the engine light will reset itself after 10-20 successful cycles, and as you can imagine, 10-20 successful cycles can take a lot of time. In this case, it?s much more convenient to reset the check engine light with an OBD2 scanner."
What if the check engine light won?t reset itself?	"If you have been driving for a long time with many successful cycles after you fixed the issue without problems, but the engine control module still doesn?t reset the check light, you must understand that some car models will not reset the check light by itself; you need to reset it with a scanner.Although a scanner may sound like an expensive tool, you can actually get a pretty good scanner for cheap these days that can save you a lot of money instead of going to a mechanic every time you need to see or reset the engine codes.You can also go to a mechanic and ask if they can reset the codes for free, and many will happily do that because for them it will take 5 minutes and they may win a customer."
Why you should not ignore the check engine light ?	"If there is a small problem with your car that causes the warning light to come on on the car?s dashboard, but it does not affect the performance of the engine, most people will just ignore it and keep driving.However, this is a bad move. Even if it was only a small problem that caused the check light to come on, it means that you will not realize quickly enough if there is a more serious problem with your engine that causes the check light to come on.For some problems ? like bad camshaft timing ? a check engine light might be the only symptom of something severe enough to eventually destroy your entire engine. Therefore, you should always fix the problem, even if it is only a small problem that caused the indicator light."
How long does it take for the engine light to reset?	"It usually takes between 10 to 20 successful cycles or starts before the check engine light resets. A successful cycle is a complete warm-up of the engine without problems. Therefore, it is much faster to reset the warning light with an OBD2 scanner."
How can I get my check engine light to go off?	"The easiest way to reset the check engine light is with a scanner, which will give you an immediate result. Otherwise, you will have to wait a long time after repairing the problem, and it may reset itself. If you have an older car, you can also try disconnecting the negative battery cable."
Do car codes clear themselves?	Yes. The error codes clear themselves after a number of successful test cycles. The number of successful test cycles required depends on the car model and engine control module but is usually between 10 and 20 cycles.
How do you reset the check engine light with the gas pedal?	"In most car models, you cannot reset the warning light with the accelerator pedal. However, you can try fully depressing the gas pedal and hold it, turning the ignition on, and depressing the brake pedal seven times, then turning the ignition off. This will reset the codes in some car models, but will not work in most of them."
Conclusion	"So you probably understood how the engine control module works along with the check engine light and the successful cycles. What you should remember is that any time you work on the engine control module and warning lights, it will help tremendously if you have a diagnostic scanner available.I hope this article helped you with your car problems and that you now have the right knowledge to fix your check engine light problems."
What Does the SRS Light Mean?	"The supplemental restraint system (SRS) light indicates that there is a problem with the airbag system. In some vehicles, you will see the letters SRS when there is an issue, while others use a figure with an airbag.Where does the term SRS come from? When airbags were first installed in vehicles, the manufacturers thought they were a replacement for standard seat belts. However, it didn?t take long for them to recognize that they were better used in conjunction with seat belts or as a supplement. That?s where the term supplement restraint system came from.To understand how the SRS light works, you must know the various parts of the airbag system. Here are a few components that make up the airbag system in modern vehicles.Airbag module: The module or modules contain the airbag and inflator assembly. Airbag sensors: Most vehicles have multiple sensors to measure the conditions leading up to a potential collision. When an accident occurs, the sensors relay that situation to the SRS module to deploy the airbags. Clockspring: This cable allows the steering wheel to turn without causing a break in the electrical contact to the airbag module.SRS module: This computer is responsible for overseeing the airbag system.Some advanced airbag systems come with more components, but these are the basic parts installed in every modern vehicle. "
What Causes the SRS Light to Come On?	"There are quite a lot of parts that can cause the SRS light to come on. The easiest way to determine any problems with the SRS or airbag system is to use a diagnostic scan tool.Here are the most common causes of the SRS light:1. Seat Belt Latch FailureThe SRS contains sensors that monitor when the seat belts are fastened. If something has gotten into the buckle, it could be interfering with the connection. To repair the problem, clean out the seat belt buckle of foreign objects. If you don?t see anything, spray into the buckle with compressed air. 2. Defective Passenger Seat Occupancy SensorIf someone is sitting in the front seat, there is a sensor that alerts the SRS system. It not only tells the sensor that someone is there, but it also reads weight.If there is an adult in the seat, the passenger airbag will be ready to protect the occupant. However, when the sensor doesn?t work right, it can cause the SRS light to come on.3. CorrosionWater damage can quickly lead to corrosion inside your vehicle. If this occurs among the SRS components, it can spell disaster. Not only can it cause the warning light to go on, but it can also affect the functionality of the system.The only way to fix this problem is to thoroughly inspect all of the components for corrosion. Anything that is affected needs to be replaced. 4. Bad ClockspringRepair Airbag ClockspringThis electrical connector is located inside the steering wheel. Its primary function is to maintain a connection with the SRS computer, even while the wheel is turning. However, this part regularly suffers from a lot of abuse. If it stops working, the driver?s side airbag might not deploy during an accident. You will also get a warning with the SRS light alerting you to the situation. 5. Dead SRS Computer Battery BackupThe SRS computer needs a backup battery to retain the data it receives. This battery continues working even when the vehicle is off. If the battery is low on power or dead, it can cause the SRS light to go on. The only way to repair this situation is to install a new battery. 6. Previous AccidentYour SRS light might go on after an accident if the airbags do not deploy. When a collision occurs, the system is likely triggered through the crash sensors. However, if something malfunctions, causing your airbags to fail, a fault will be sent to the computer. The result is the SRS light telling you that the computer needs to be reset. 7. Faulty SRS ComputerOver time, all electrical components fail. The SRS computer is no different and is not immune to malfunctioning. Heat, excessive vibration, age and water damage can all lead to its demise.If the SRS light comes on because of a dead computer, the only repair is a replacement. "
How Do I Reset the SRS Light?	"You should never just turn off the SRS light. This doesn?t fix any of the problems; it only stops the alert from occurring. The only time you should reset the SRS light is after you repair the initial problems. With an OBDII scanner, you can erase the trouble codes and reset the light. However, not all scanners come with this capability. Before you purchase one, make sure it can read and erase SRS codes."
Can I Drive With the SRS Light On?	"No, it?s not a good idea to drive with the SRS Light on. Your vehicle will still operate with the SRS light on. However, if your SRS light is illuminated the airbag system will not function in case of an accident.We recommend getting to the service station immediately to find out what the problem is. If you have a code scanner, you might be able to read the DTCs yourself.Additionally, driving with the SRS light on could cause trouble with the insurance company. If you get into an accident and the black box recorder is looked at, the insurance provider will know that you didn?t protect the occupants, leaving you liable for the damages.  "
How Much Does It Cost To Fix The SRS Light?	"SRS light repair costs vary greatly depending on what the problem is. If your issue is something simple such as debris in the seat belt latch, you might just need some compressed air to resolve the situation. However, it could also be due to a failed airbag assembly, which could cost into thousands of dollars. The only way to know for sure is to have the codes scanned and get an estimate."
What does SRS mean?	SRS stands for supplemental restraint system. A supplemental restraint system (SRS) is an airbag or seatbelt used as an additional safety restraint to prevent or reduce injuries in the event of a crash.
Will airbags deploy if the SRS light is on?	No. In most car models the airbag will not deploy if the SRS light is on. This is considered a safety feature so that it will not be accidentally deployed if there is a problem in the system.
Can a blown fuse cause the airbag light to come on?	"A blown fuse to the airbag control module may cause the airbag light to appear, but it is not a very common problem. If your airbag light is on, the best way to determine what is wrong is to check the fault codes with an OBD2 scanner."
How do I turn off the SRS light?	"To turn off the SRS light, you must repair the problem and reset the trouble codes with a diagnostic tool. In older car models, it may be enough to disconnect the car battery. However, in modern car models, you may need to reset it with a tool."
Reasons For A Check Engine Light On But No Codes ?	"If your check engine light is on but can?t see any codes, it?s most likely due to having the wrong scanner or one that is incompatible with your vehicle. There could also be an electrical short or blown fuse causing the light to come on for no reason.Here is a more detailed list of the most common reasons why your check engine light is on but no codes:1. Wrong Code ScannerDiagnostics E1629754686101No two code scanners are the same. You can find plenty of low-cost diagnostic scanners on the market that read the most basic codes, but these aren?t going to give you everything you need with the emissions system or transmission. Additionally, if you choose to go to a local auto parts store for a free code scan, the workers there aren?t busting out an expensive diagnostic tool. Instead, you are getting a basic scan that might not encompass the codes that are set.You can find some good scanner alternatives here: The Best OBD2 Scanners2. Electrical ShortIt?s unlikely that there?s an electrical short causing your trouble, but not impossible. If a short has occurred somewhere in the system, power could be jumping to the light, forcing it to be on.You can confirm if this is the case by turning the key to the On position without starting the engine. The light should go off after a few seconds. If it doesn?t, a short might be the problem. 3. User ErrorWhile you may think you have automotive diagnostics in the bag, there?s always the chance that you missed something. Even though the code reader is a simple tool to use, you can?t overlook the possibility that you did something wrong.Take a moment to re-read the owner?s manual of your scan tool. Follow the instructions, no matter how simple they may be. It?s possible you overlooked something basic.4. Blown FuseWhen the code scanner is plugged into its port but nothing is reading, you might think about trashing the OBD2 device. Don?t get rid of it quite yet, because a blown fuse might be to blame.The engine control module (ECM), electronic control unit (ECU), and powertrain control module (PCM) all run off of a fuse, just like the other electrical devices in your vehicle. If the fuse blows, juice cannot get to the required component. The light might come on, even though there?s no actual fault. Read the owner?s manual to figure out which fuses you should check. 5. Contaminated PortWhen you are ready to use the OBD2 scanner, you plug it into the appropriate port located under the dashboard. If the scanner isn?t working or pulling codes, there could be an issue with the connection itself.Examine the OBD port to see if dust or debris has contaminated the connector. Thankfully, this should be an easy repair that only takes you a few seconds to fix."
What is the Check Engine Light?	"The Check Engine Light is otherwise known as the Malfunction Indicator Lamp. This light comes on the dashboard to alert you to an issue with the engine computer on your vehicle. Check Engine Lights can appear in a variety of colors, depending on the manufacturer. Usually, this light will be yellow, orange, or amber. If the light comes on solid, there?s an error code that needs to be read. However, if the light is flashing, it?s an indication that something major is happening that requires attention immediately. "
What is an OBDII Code Scanner?	"OBD2 stands for Onboard Diagnostics II. This advanced diagnostics system has been included in every vehicle since 1996. The technology allows you to check the engine and other vital systems to determine what issues are prevalent. OBD systems remain standard across all new car makes and models. With this system, there?s one universal connector used so the device can read a multitude of vehicles. If you plan to monitor the health of your vehicle, an OBD2 scanner is essential to reading engine codes. However, different code readers are meant to diagnose various systems, which is why you have to be careful which one you purchase. "
How to Fix Check Engine Light With No Codes ?	"The first place to start is by looking at the code scanner. Are you using the right scanner and is it capable of reading a multitude of codes? If you haven?t invested in a high-quality scanner, now might be the time. Of course, the scanner might also be defective. Try it out on another vehicle to see if it?s working properly. If not, it?s time to replace it. You also want to check the port where you are plugging it in. If there?s debris clogging up the connection, use some compressed air to clean it out. Your next step would be to check for a blown fuse. The layout of fuses can be found in the owner?s manual. Look for the fuse that?s running the ECU, ECM or PCM and check to see if it?s been blown. If so, replacing the fuse should only cost you a few dollars and the Check Engine Light should go away.Anything beyond these simple fixes might require a professional. If you aren?t sure how to hunt down an electrical short, you may want to take it into the shop for further inspection."
How to Reset Check Engine Light ?	"The easiest way to reset the check engine light is by using an OBD2 scanner. But if you don?t have one available, try disconnecting the battery, cycling the ignition, pulling a fuse, or letting it go away on its own.Here are some more detailed steps on how to reset your check engine light:Total Time: 5 minutesUse an OBD2 ScannerReset Engine LightIf you have an OBD2 scanner available, you can reset your Check Engine Light within seconds. To get one, you can check out our other article on the best OBD2 scanners to buy.When your check engine light is on, connect the scanner to the OBD connector situated under most car models? steering portion. Then switch on your car?s ignition to the ON position. After the connection is established between the computer and the car, press the ?read? button on the scanner to search for all the stored trouble codes.After the scan is complete, note down all error codes diagnosed by the scanner, decode those problems using the user manual of the particular make and model. Once the code is decoded, the problem is detected. Solve that problem; if that part needs to change, then change it, and if it needs to be calibrated, then calibrate it.Once you have solved any problems, erase the error from the scanner by pressing the ?Erase/Clear? button. Once the problem is solved, it is recommended to switch off the ignition, then switch it again, check to see that the engine check light is not on again, and recheck from the scanner whether it is giving the same fault again or not.Battery Disconnection TechniqueDisconnect Car BatteryThe best way to reset the check engine light without a scan tool is by removing the battery terminal for 30-60 seconds. This will reset the engine control unit in many car models.First, remove the negative car battery terminal. Then try to drain any available electricity present in the car?s capacitor by pressing the horn for around 20-30 seconds or turning on the lights. Once the electricity is disconnected, then leave your car for 10-15 mins. After this short time, reconnect the battery terminals, make sure they are well tightened to avoid any possible sparking, and then switch on your car.If your car gives that same check engine light after restarting, then it means there is some serious problem in your car, or your car stores the codes anyway. In such a case, it is highly recommended to check the codes with a scanner instead because some car models will not reset the codes by removing the power.Turning the Ignition On and Off Turn IgnitionSwitching the ignition on and off is also one method of hard reset without disconnecting the battery. Put the keys in your ignition and turn your ignition on and off consecutively after a second in each step.Once it is done, see if the engine check light is still coming on or not. If the check light is off, you are ready to go, but if it is still coming on, get ready by reading the codes with a scanner instead.Let it Go Off ItselfDriving CarAnother way to reset the check engine light is to wait and let it go off by itself. It is a straightforward method; you have only to wait and continue driving your car for around three days. Cars? computers work in a continuous cycle and refresh their present state.Remember that you have to make sure that the problem is gone before using this technique.For example, if the ECU detects a problem in the oxygen sensor that could occur due to a minor glitch, then it might fix automatically as the ECU will update the sensor?s status once the glitch is removed, turning off the check engine light. But if your check light is still on even after three days, then either apply the above-mentioned methods yourself or take your car to a mechanic. Read more about it here: Will the check engine light reset itself?Pulling Off the Fuse and Put It backPull FuseOne way to get your check engine light to turn off is to pull off the engine control unit?s fuse and then put it back again. Although this won?t solve the problem in newer cars, it may solve the problem in older cars, and it is easy to try. Check your repair manual to find the fuse to the engine control unit."
what should I do If the Engine Check Light Returns ?	"Once you have successfully reset your check engine light, you are ready to go. But if your check engine light turns on again after a few days, it means there is a problem in your car that needs to get fixed.It is now time to get your car diagnosed for real with a scanner. Either by buying one yourself or going to a workshop that can read the codes in your car."
Can I reset the check engine light without disconnecting the battery?	"You can reset the check engine light without disconnecting the battery by using an OBD2 scanner. If you drive long enough after fixing the problem, most car models? check engine light will go away by itself."
How do I reset my check engine light without a scanner?	"The best way to reset the check engine light without a scanner is to repair the problem and keep driving for an extended period. In some car models, you can also remove the battery terminals to reset the engine control unit."
How long does it take for the check engine light to reset?	"If you are sure you have fixed the problem, it takes around 10-30 successful cycles before the check engine light disappears. A successful cycle is defined as going from a cold start until the engine is warm."
Will the check engine light go off by itself?	"Yes. The check engine light will reset itself after a fixed amount of time if you fixed the problem in most car models. Usually, this is 10-30 cycles. One cycle is from a cold start until the engine is at working temperature."
Conclusion	"The most efficient way to reset a check engine light is by using a diagnostic scanner to clear the trouble code memory. There are also some other methods you can try, but most of them won?t work in modern car models. You can also drive for a long time after fixing the problem, and the check engine light will disappear by itself.A simple trick you can try to reset the check engine light is to pull the fuse to the engine control module or disconnect the car battery, if you have an old car. However, this won?t work in most newer car models.If you frequently deal with check engine lights or other warning lights, it is much more worthwhile to invest in a code scanner to reset the codes within seconds without having to disconnect batteries or pull fuses. If you have a workshop, having one is definitely a no-brainer."
What Does The Electronic Throttle Control Light (ETC) Mean?	"The electronic throttle control (ETC) light indicates that there is an issue with the throttle system. The throttle system includes the throttle body, accelerator pedal, and wirings. The electronic throttle control system controls and monitors the position of the throttle.While older vehicles use a cable that?s linked directly to the throttle body, most modern cars accomplish this feat through sensors and your vehicle?s ECM.While there are plenty of advantages to this, if everything isn?t working the way it should, then you?re not going to accelerate the way you should."
what is the Electronic Throttle Control Light Function?	"Your electronic throttle control light monitors the throttle control system to ensure that everything works the way it should. When it?s not, the light turns on to let you know that there is a problem.The only other time you should see the electronic throttle control light is when you turn on your vehicle. At this point, your vehicle is completing a system check, and when everything checks out, the light should turn off. However, if the light stays on, you have an underlying problem that you need to address.The easiest way to narrow down where you need to look is to hook up an OBD2 reader. While these tools can?t tell you with 100 percent certainty what the problem is, they can give you a good place to start your search."
What Causes An Electronic Throttle Control Light To Come On?	"The most common causes of an electronic throttle control light are a faulty throttle control sensor or a faulty throttle accelerator pedal position sensor. But while those are the most common causes of an electronic throttle light, they aren?t the only things that could be going on.We?ve taken a deep dive into the three most common problems below.1. Faulty Throttle Control SensorThrottle Body LocationJust because your vehicle?s ECM tells the throttle to open a specific amount doesn?t mean that the ECM trusts that it will. It actually relies on the throttle control sensor to tell it how far the throttle has actually opened and makes fuel-to-air ratio adjustments based on that.As every good mechanic knows, you need to trust but verify. This is exactly what your ECM is doing by listening to the throttle control sensor. So, when everything doesn?t come back the way it expects, it throws an electronic throttle control light so you can check out what?s going on.In some throttle bodies, the sensor is not replaceable and you may have to replace the whole throttle body, which can be quite costly.2. Faulty Accelerator Pedal Position SensorAccelerator Pedal Position Sensor LocationThere are a few different parts to your electronic throttle control system, and an integral one is the accelerator pedal position sensor. This sensor communicates with your vehicle?s ECM to let it know how fast you want to go.From there, the ECM tells the throttle how much to open or close. But if the ECM can?t get an accurate reading from the pedal due to a faulty sensor, you?ll never get the acceleration you want. If the computer recognizes that something is wrong with the sensor, you?ll get an electronic throttle control light.3. Stuck Throttle BodyDirty Throttle BodyIt doesn?t matter if everything on the electric side of the house is working correctly if the physical throttle body is stuck. There are plenty of reasons that the throttle body can get stuck, but a common one is carbon build-up.Take a look at your throttle body and ensure that it can easily open and close. If it can?t, see if you can remove any obstructions and try cleaning it with a high-quality carb cleaner. If that still doesn?t work, you might need to replace the throttle body."
Is It Safe To Drive With an Electronic Throttle Control Light?	"It is not safe to drive with an electronic throttle control light. While you might be lucky and only have a drop in fuel efficiency or a slight drop in acceleration, the problem can quickly get worse if the sensor readings continue to go awry.The throttle body controls how much air enters the engine, and if your vehicle?s ECM can?t keep accurate tabs on this, then it can quickly lead to an out-of-control engine. If you have an electronic throttle light that?s on, you can quickly damage your engine, which can lead to even more expensive repairs when you get it to a repair shop.This is true even if you don?t notice significant drops in your throttle response or vehicle performance. That?s because the air to fuel ratio isn?t what it should be, which can lead to premature engine wear over time."
How much does it cost to fix the ETC light?	"The cost to fix the ETC light will depend on the underlying cause of the light coming on. If it is a simple issue, like a dirty throttle body, then it may only cost a few dollars to fix. However, if there is a more serious problem, like a bad throttle body or throttle body sensor, it could cost between $100 and $800 to repair."
Is there a fuse for the electronic throttle control?	"There isn?t a fuse specifically for the electronic throttle control in the majority of most modern cars, but there is a fuse for the engine control module. The engine control module is what controls the electronic throttle control, so if that fuse blows, then the electronic throttle control will no longer work."
How do I reset my ETC light?	"To reset the ETC light, you must use an OBD2 scanner. However, in most cases you cannot simply reset the ETC light by clearing the fault code memory. You probably need to fix the problem that caused the warning light in the first place."
Why is my ETC light blinking?	"If your electronic throttle control warning light is blinking, it indicates that there is an ongoing issue that needs immediate attention. Take your vehicle to a mechanic workshop or diagnose it yourself as soon as possible."
Conclusion	"When the throttle control light comes on, it indicates a problem with the throttle control system. The throttle control system includes the accelerator pedal, throttle body, and all the parts in between.While you might feel that everything is getting more complicated in modern vehicles, these complicated features have huge benefits. Not only do you get better fuel economy, but you get a more powerful and more responsive engine.When your throttle control light comes on, the first thing you want to do is read the trouble codes with a diagnostic scanner. In most cases, the scanner will tell you exactly what is causing the warning light to come on.So, while you might be cursing at the electronic throttle control light now, when you get everything back to working as it should, you?ll be glad you have it. And despite what the crusty mechanic at the shop might tell you, the old linkage systems used to act up from time to time too."
What is the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL)?	"The Malfunction Indicator Light or MIL is the technical name for the Check Engine Light. It?s a warning light that comes on the dashboard to tell you when there?s a system malfunction. It?s the ECU?s way of alerting you to potential trouble.The light comes on after a series of checks to determine that something is operating outside of its parameters.Sometimes, the Malfunction Indicator Light comes on because of something trivial, such as a loose gas cap. Other times, it points to something more serious, such as catalytic converter failure. Either way, the only way to decipher the trouble is with an OBDII code scanner. "
What to Do When Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) Illuminates ?	"If the MIL is solid and consistent, you want to look for any signs of trouble. You should also have the diagnostic trouble codes (DTC) checked as soon as possible with an OBDII code scanner. If the Check Engine Light is blinking, pull the car over and don?t drive it until the diagnostics are complete. 1. Solid LightIf the Check Engine Light comes on and stays on, there could be multiple issues. However, the fault could be something obvious, such as leaving the gas cap off when you last filled it up. It?s wise to give your car a quick inspection to see if something noticeable is to blame. If so, you can correct the problem quickly and move on.However, if you don?t spot an immediate issue, you will need to pay close attention to any other symptoms that are occurring. Do you notice any performance troubles? Are there any unusual smells or sounds? Is the car shaking or vibrating? All of these answers will help you get to the bottom of what?s happening.It?s also wise to take note of any other lights that came on at the same time. With some faults, the issue will trigger multiple lights, which could help you narrow down where the problem is coming from. For example, if the Check Engine Light and Oil Pressure Light come on at the same time, you know the car is struggling with oil pressure. Fixing the other light first will help to turn off the Check Engine Light. You will use this information in conjunction with whatever the DTC scanner reveals. Plug your OBDII code scanner into the port and read the engine codes. If there are too many to read, erase them and take the car for a test drive to reset the most recent. With these codes in hand, you can better determine where the fault lies, so you can fix it. 2. Flashing LightYou should never treat a flashing Malfunction Indicator Lamp the same way you do when it comes on steadily. The flashing light is trying to get your attention, and you would be wise to listen. For starters, pull the car over in a safe location. You do not want to drive the vehicle with this light flashing, or more damage could occur.If you have a code scanner, you can read the DTCs and determine the issue. Otherwise, you might need to have the vehicle towed to a repair shop for further help. "
How to Turn Off the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) ?	"The Check Engine Light doesn?t turn itself off until the problem that triggered it is repaired. With some vehicles, the intermittent fault that occurred would have to be resolved for several trips before the light would go off on its own. Otherwise, you can clean the fault codes with your scan tool to reset the light.In older vehicles, you could disconnect the battery to clear out the memory and that would turn off the light. However, the Check Engine Light always comes back on if the problem isn?t repaired. Plus, pulling the battery can also cause some annoyances that aren?t worth dealing with. Before you clear any codes, consider if that?s the best option. By clearing out older codes, you might lose valuable data that will help you troubleshoot the problem. If you need to monitor conditions for a certain amount of time to troubleshoot, erasing the codes could set you back a little. You might have to wait for new data before you can get the heart of what?s going on. Instead, you want to read through the old codes first and try to decipher what?s happening. The only way to turn off the Malfunction Indicator Light for good is to repair the problem. Once the fix is complete, you can reset the codes and the light shouldn?t come back on. If it does, you have to go back to the drawing board and start diagnostics once again. "
Cost to Turn off Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) ?	"The cost to fix the Malfunctioning Indicator Lamp (MIL) depends on two important factors. First, the repair cost directly relates to what needs to be fixed. Secondly, your cost will change dramatically if you don?t have a code scanner and/or you need a professional to repair the problem. For the sake of this article, let?s assume that you need to have a professional fix the Malfunctioning Indicator Lamp. Here are a few problems you might be dealing with and the approximate repair costs. Tighten or replace a loose or broken gas cap: $25-$75Replace malfunctioning oxygen sensor: $150-$450Replace damaged catalytic convert: $1,500-$3,500Replace spark plugs and ignition coils: $250-$450Replace ignition coils: $150-$450Replace thermostat: $200-$400Replace mass airflow sensor: $250-$450Replace fuel injector: $300-$750Replace evaporative emissions (EVAP) purge control valve: $110-$275The repair cost also heavily depends upon what type of car you drive. If you are behind the wheel of a common vehicle, such as a Chevy or Dodge, your parts might not be as expensive as the luxury automobile, such as an Audi or Mercedes-Benz. You can also get just about any technician to work on your mainstream vehicles, where it could take a special mechanic to repair your BMW or other foreign import. For this reason, it?s difficult to give an accurate estimate of what the repair might cost.One way you can save money is to visit a local auto parts store if you don?t have your own code scanner. For free, many of these locations will scan the computer and give you the codes. You will still need to do your own research to figure out what the problem is, but you will save money on diagnostics."
Most Common Car Symbols & Warning Lights ?	"There are some dashboard symbols and warning lights that are more common than others. Some are specific to certain car brands, while others will be seen on most car models on the market. We start by showing you the most common dashboard symbols that can be seen on most cars.What you should know is that in general, when it comes to cars, a red warning light means that there is danger and it should be checked immediately, while a yellow or orange warning light is a warning and should be checked as soon as possible. A green or blue light lets you know the system is on and operatingNormally, most car dashboard warning lights and symbols should be on for 3-5 seconds after you turn on the ignition, but if it stays on while the engine is running, there is probably something wrong that needs to be fixed.

What do car dashboard symbols mean?	"There are over 100 different car symbols, so to see each meaning, you must check your owner?s manual for your particular car model. Red generally indicates stop or danger, and yellow is for caution ? you should visit a mechanic. Blue, green, and white all mean everything is normal and the system in your car is on and operating.However, it?s important to note that different car models sometimes use different colors for similar warnings, so it?s always best to check your owner?s manual before taking any action."
What does a flashing dashboard symbol mean?	"A flashing check engine light or another flashing symbol usually means there is a major issue with the system or that the problem is occurring at the moment. Severe damage or safety issues can occur if a flashing dashboard symbol is not addressed. Therefore, if you see a flashing dashboard symbol you should get in touch with a mechanic as soon as possible. However, this depends on the car model, and sometimes a flashing system just means a system is operating."
What are the symbols on the dashboard for?	"The symbols on the dashboard indicate the operation of various systems and devices in your car. For instance, a picture of a yellow engine means there is an issue with the engine system. A green light bulb means that the headlights are on. There are many other symbols, and they can vary depending on the make of your car. You can usually find an explanation of all the symbols in your car?s owner?s manual."
What are the main dashboard warning lights?	"The main dashboard warning lights used by most car manufacturers are the check engine light, ABS light, oil pressure warning light, airbag indicator, battery charge light, coolant overheating light, and low washer fluid light."
Conclusion	"Dashboard symbols are very important ? they give you an understanding of what is happening with your car. By familiarizing yourself with the various symbols, you can save a lot of time and money when something goes wrong.If you?re ever unsure of what a particular dashboard warning light or symbol means, check your car?s owner?s manual. If the problem persists, take your vehicle to a qualified mechanic as soon as possible to avoid serious damage."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Distributor ?	"When the distributor starts going bad, the engine may misfire or backfire. You may also get a Check Engine Light on the dashboard or deal with a shaking engine. The idle can be rough, acceleration more difficult and the car may fail an emissions test.Take a look at the symptoms closer to see which ones you are dealing with. Many of these occur whenever there?s something wrong with the ignition system, so more diagnosis may be necessary.1. Misfiring EngineEngine MisfiresWhen fuel isn?t combusting in one of the cylinders, the engine is going to misfire. A misfiring engine feels as if the car is jerking and failing to respond. A misfiring engine isn?t just caused by a bad distributor. It?s also a common symptom when there?s a spark plug issue, a bad fuel injector or a faulty ignition coil (on newer models).2. Backfiring EngineBackfireBackfiring is very similar to misfiring. It occurs when unburned fuel leaves the cylinder and ignites in the exhaust as it exits the system. Backfiring creates a loud sound that draws a lot of attention to your vehicle. It can also cause the car to stall. 3. Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light CarIf the distributor isn?t running the firing cycle correctly, the Check Engine Light will come on. This message tells you that something is wrong, requiring your attention.However, the Check Engine Light doesn?t only indicate something wrong with the distributor. Unless you read the trouble codes with a compatible scanner, you won?t know what?s going on. Keep in mind that OBD-II was only required on vehicles 1996 or newer. If you have an older vehicle, which is very possible, the same procedures will not apply. Also, the systems have become more functional as the cars have gotten newer. Even if it is equipped with OBD-II, you may not learn as much as you hoped for on an older car. If you need help deciphering the results of your scan, check out our online trouble code library.4. Shaking EngineWhen the car starts shaking, you may think there?s something wrong with the wheels or suspension. However, when the engine shakes, you are dealing with something more serious.If the distributor goes bad, the engine is prone to shaking and vibrating. Because the distributor affects firing order, any imbalance can throw off the normal operation. The shaking may not be to the same extent as when the tires are worn, but it could be enough to catch your attention. 5. Rough IdleCar Engine Rough IdleWith the firing of the cylinders off-track, the engine is going to run rough. You may notice it more when the engine is idling. In fact, the idle can become so bad that you think the motor might stall. If it does, you may also have trouble getting the car started again. Some people think it helps to keep the RPMs up while idling. To do this, you need to put a foot on the gas pedal and another on the brake while idling. Still, this isn?t recommended due to safety reasons.6. Rough AccelerationIt?s important for the firing to be just right if you want the engine to respond when you push down on the accelerator. If you put your foot down and nothing seems to happen right away or if the engine sputters slightly before accelerating, it could be because of the distributor.Of course, this symptom occurs with many other problems. For that reason, it?s important to run through a complete diagnosis before deciding that the distributor is to blame. 7. Failed Emission TestCar Emission TestIf you live in an area that requires emission testing, you may not recognize the problem until the car fails. The distributor is responsible for firing the cylinders in order. Without the right order, unburned fuel is going to leave the engine through the exhaust.If your car fails the test, don?t just assume the distributor is the cause. There are many other reasons for failing, so you want to troubleshoot the problem. "
What Is The Function Of A Distributor?	"The distributor is an integral part of the ignition system. Basically, it distributes the spark to each of the plugs. Voltage comes from the ignition coil and goes through the distributor cap with the help of the spark plug wire. From here, the voltage goes through the center terminal into the rotor, which is located within the distributor. The rotors turns, sending voltage to the outer terminals in the right order. As the voltage goes through the outer terminals, each of the spark plugs gets the power it needs. The spark plugs fire in an appropriate order, igniting the air-fuel mixture in the cylinders. Some distributors also have the job of running the engine oil pump, although this isn?t typical across the board. "
Where is the Distributor Located?	"The distributor is found under the hood of your car on the motor. As you search under the hood, you are looking for the distributor cap. It?s a plastic piece that?s colored red, gray or black. It resembles a crown. It?s connected with blue or black cables that come out of the top. These are the spark plug wires, which are transferring power to the plugs.If you are unable to locate the distributor, follow the spark plug wires to see where they attach to. The wires connect on one side to the spark plugs and the other side to the distributor cap. There may also be directions in your owner?s manual or you can look at a diagram in your factory service manual. If you find the distributor cap in bad shape once you locate it, you should replace it. The cap should never be cracked or worn. "
How Much Does it Cost to Replace a Distributor?	"The average cost to have a distributor replaced is $350 to $850. The main price factor is what type of car you drive. Older models tend to be even more expensive, especially if the parts are difficult to find. If you can perform the work yourself, the price will be lower because you won?t need to pay for the labor costs. However, you don?t want to replace a distributor unless you know what you are doing. "
how to test the Distributor ?	"If you want to test the distributor yourself, the steps aren?t difficult. You don?t need to be an ASE Certified Mechanic to work on the distributor. However, you do want to have some basic mechanical knowledge and some common tools on hand. Follow any recommendations in your service manual. Beyond that, you can use our steps.Locate the distributor in the engine compartment. You can find some suggestions up above.Inspect the distributor cap for damage. If there are any cracks, corrosion or damage, it?s important to replace it.Pull the spark plugs wires off of the distributor. Before you do this, take a picture or make a note of where they go. They must be reinstalled back in the same position.Put the tip of a screwdriver close enough to the distributor to create an arc with the engine running. Don?t touch the wires directly. This helps you diagnose any faulty connections with the distributor.You can also use a multimeter to run some checks. Here are a few suggestions.Connect the multimeter to the positive and negative coil terminals. Set it to Ohms.The resistance of the connections from the distributor cap should be between 600 and 1400 Ohms. If so, the coil is working normally. Connect the multimeter to the terminals on the igniter. Read the Ohms and compare them with factory specs.Connect the multimeter to the terminals of the pickup coil. Read the Ohms and compare them with factory specs.If you?ve tried to figure out what?s wrong and can?t or you are unsure about performing the repair yourself, reach out to a local mechanic. It?s better to pay for a professional repair than to cause more damage because of inexperience. "
Can a car run without a distributor?	"If the vehicle is set up with a distributor, it must be in good working order for the car to run. Without it, the engine can?t get the spark it needs to ignite the air-fuel mixture in the cylinders. In cases where the distributor is going bad, the engine will crank, but it will be unable to start or run correctly. "
How often does a distributor need to be replaced?	"The distributor itself should last the lifetime of the vehicle. However, most manufacturers recommend replacing the distributor cap, rotor and spark plugs on a regular basis. Some automakers have these maintenance services set up for as little as every 30,000 miles, although they should last longer. "
How many hours does it take to replace a distributor?	"If you are only replacing the cap and rotor, you may be able to complete the job in a couple of hours. Replacing the distributor can be slightly more complicated, requiring a half of a day or more. Having some expertise and the right tools can dramatically cut down on the installation time."
Can I fix a broken distributor?	"If the damage isn?t too severe, the distributor can be rebuilt. You can price out the difference between buying a new distributor and having one rebuilt. Most drivers find that it makes sense to spend a little more and get a brand-new distributor just for peace of mind. "
Conclusion	"While broken distributors are slowly becoming a thing of the past, there?s still a chance you have a car with one. If so, it?s important to know the symptoms of failure and have the tips to diagnose problems. Even though the procedures can be intimidating, there?s no reason to doubt your abilities.If your car isn?t running right and the distributor is to blame, you don?t want to waste any time. The vehicle could stall and fail to restart at any moment. Get the car looked at and have it fixed to ensure reliable transportation once again. "
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Coil Pack ?	"When the coil pack goes bad, you can expect the Check Engine Light to come on, and it will probably be blinking. The engine may also misfire, and the fuel consumption increases. With that comes a rough idle, trouble accelerating, a changed sound to the engine and a possible fuel smell.Many of these symptoms occur whenever there?s an issue with the engine. For that reason, you can?t use one symptom alone to determine there?s a problem with the coil pack. Let?s examine these bad coil pack symptoms closer to see what you might be dealing with. 1. Misfiring EngineEngine MisfiresThe air-fuel mixture in a gasoline engine must be properly ignited for the engine to run smoothly. When the ignition pack doesn?t operate as it should, this mixture can?t ignite.The result is a misfiring engine that feels like it sputters or jerks when in Drive. As you stop at lights, the misfire can be so bad that it causes the engine to shake and vibrate. 2. Blinking Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light CarThe Check Engine Light is designed to tell you when something?s wrong with the motor. All modern cars are equipped with a self-diagnostic system known as OBD-II. When an engine sensor notices something operating outside of normal parameters, the Check Engine Light comes on and a code is set in the system. If there?s a severe problem, the light will blink, telling you to stop driving before engine damage occurs. With a compatible scanner, you can read the trouble codes coming from the engine sensors to determine what?s wrong. It?s possible that your vehicle is throwing a P0351 code, indicating trouble with the ignition system. You could also see a code related to the engine misfire. 3. Increased Fuel ConsumptionFuel ConsumptionIgnition coils can fail spontaneously or go bad over time. As they wear, the fuel economy of your car gradually decreases. By using a gas mileage calculator, you can keep a close eye on your car?s fuel economy, so you?ll notice when there?s a problem. Even if you find the drop in fuel economy to be related to another mechanical issue, you?ll be happy you noticed it. After all, no one wants to waste money on gas. 4. Rough IdleLow Idle RpmAny mechanical malfunction that fails to ignite the air-fuel mixture can lead to rough idling. For that reason, the coil packs must be considered.Along with the coil packs, clogged air filters, failing spark plugs and dirty fuel injectors could also be to blame. That?s why you can?t diagnose the problem on this symptom alone. 5. Rough AccelerationThe same can be said about trouble with acceleration. While it is a symptom of a bad coil pack, it can also be the root of most engine malfunctions.If there?s a drop in power when you step on the accelerator, something is wrong that should be dealt with immediately. If you allow the problem to continue, the vehicle may begin to stall. 6. Changed Engine SoundSmoke From ExhaustEarlier, we talked about a misfiring engine. This symptom also comes with some strange noises you may not be used to hearing. As the engine jerks and bucks, you are going to hear a louder sound. If the coil pack is bad, it can cause the engine to run on one or more cylinders less than normal, and this will cause your engine sound to change.In extreme cases, the car could also backfire. This loud banging noise occurs whenever there?s unburned fuel escaping from the exhaust. You want to have this fixed not only to prevent further damage but also to avoid embarrassment from the sounds. 7. Fuel SmellIf the fuel mixture isn?t being burnt properly, you could smell a hint of gasoline. However, ignition problems aren?t the only reason for this symptom either.In fact, most often when there?s a gasoline smell, it?s related to the fuel or exhaust system. If this symptom is occurring with some of the others we mentioned, it could be caused by the coil packs or spark plugs. "
What Is The Function Of A Coil Pack?	"The coil packs work in conjunction with the spark plugs. To create a spark, there must be a high-voltage supply to ensure the fuel burns in the cylinder. As combustion begins, the coil pack is responsible for building up the appropriate amount of energy. In some cases, that is between 50,000 and 75,000 volts.The electronic control module, or computer, then sends the signal to the ignition control to release voltage from the coil pack. This voltage travels to the spark plugs, where the spark can jump the gap and ignite the fuel-air mixture in the cylinder chamber. "
Where Is The Coil Pack Located?	"Today?s gas-powered motors usually use independent coil systems known as coil on plug. This coil is fitted over each spark plug individually. So, if you have an eight-cylinder engine with eight spark plugs, you also probably have eight coils too.However, older engines used a different coil design fitted with coil packs. Instead of one coil for every spark plug, there would be a coil pack for multiple plugs. For example, an eight-cylinder engine may have four coil packs, one for every two spark plugs. Coil packs can be located anywhere on the engine. Every model does it differently. Often, these coil packs are in a different location from the spark plugs, requiring a wire to connect the two together. If you trace the wire coming from the spark plug, you can find the coil pack attached to it. The downside to the coil packs is that if one coil fails, the entire pack needs to be replaced. The packs are molded together and cannot be separated. "
How Much Does a Coil Pack Replacement Cost?	"On average, expect to spend between $250 and $450 for a coil pack replacement. This estimate includes the parts and labor for a standard car. Prices may be different based on where you live, the type of vehicle you drive and how many coil packs need to be replaced.Additionally, you may want to have the spark plugs replaced at the same time. If it?s almost time to replace them as part of your regular maintenance, you may as well do it while you are already working on the car.  If you can perform any of this work on your own, you will also save some money. In some vehicles, it?s simple to replace the coil packs with some basic mechanic tools. Interestingly, the price to replace a coil pack is often more than replacing the coil over plug in newer models. Because this system handles multiple spark plugs, it is naturally more expensive. Additionally, they can be harder to find since they are on older vehicles. You may need to order your coil packs online if your local auto parts store doesn?t carry them. "
how to test the Coil Pack ?	"You can test the coil packs yourself to see if they are failing. We recommend getting a service manual for your vehicle, so you can check the readings against the manufacturer?s specifications. The specifications differ depending on the coil pack type, but here are some general recommendations.Follow these steps.Find the coil pack. We showed you the location above.Remove the spark plug wires from the terminal. Take out the pack with a ratchet and socket or a wrench. Use a multimeter to read Ohms. Set it to 200 Ohms.Hook the multimeter up to the appropriate terminals.Test the coil pack for continuity. Most coils have continuity between 0.3 Ohms and 1.0 Ohms.Next, you want to check the coil pack for secondary resistance. Set your multimeter to the 20,000 Ohms range. Put the probes on the appropriate terminals. There?s a protruding tower connecting the secondary winding in the ignition coil. You should see a reading between 5,000 and 12,000 Ohms. The value may read 5.0 to 12.0.A reading of O.L suggests that there is an open loop in the circuit. If the readings don?t match what?s in the manual, you should replace the coil pack. Additionally, you can scan the engine for codes to see what faults have been discovered. You may find multiple problems occurring at once. "
Can I drive with a faulty coil pack?	"You may still be able to operate the vehicle, but we don?t recommend driving it. Not only will there be performance issues that can cause an accident due to the unpredictability, but it?s also possible to ruin other vital parts. As an example, the catalytic converter will eventually fail after driving your car this way. "
How often do coil packs need to be replaced?	"Most manufacturers don?t have a recommended service interval for the coil packs. This older technology isn?t used in today?s vehicles, so you should only replace them when necessary. It?s expected that most coil packs will last at least 100,000 miles without any trouble. "
What causes coil pack damage?	"Wear and tear is the most common reason for failure. Many years of abuse will take a toll on the ignition coil packs. Additionally, the vibration from the engine and driving can cause the insulation to break, leading to a short in the electrical connection. "
Are coil packs the same as spark plugs?	"Many online sources tell you that spark plugs and coil packs are the same things, but it?s not true. The coil packs supply the voltage to the spark plugs. On modern engines, there?s a coil on plug for every spark plug, while older vehicles often use a coil pack for multiple plugs. "
Conclusion	"The car?s ignition system is fascinating and we still marvel at it today after many years of working on vehicles. If everything is running as it should, it?s like a well-oiled machine with everything in its place performing its job. On the flip side, the second something malfunctions during the operation, everything seems to go downhill. The coil packs may not be a large part of the car, but they have a big purpose. Without them doing their job, the whole performance of the engine suffers. If you notice problems with the coil packs, whether fuel economy has dropped or the engine is misfiring, it?s time to have it looked at before bigger problems occur."
What Does White Spark Plug Tips Mean?	"When the tip of the spark plug turns white, it indicates that the engine is running too hot and lean. The spark plug tip has been burned. As oxygen meets with the spark plug, fuel impurities and iron oxide react to cause the white residue.When the spark plug becomes white, you know you have larger problems on your hand. It?s not enough to change the spark plugs, you must also find the cause before it happens again. "
what are the Causes Of White Spark Plug Tips ?	"Most often, the cause of the white spark plug tip is a lean air-fuel mixture. This can be caused by low fuel pressure, a bad engine sensor a bad fuel pump. It?s also possible that the spark plugs are simply old or you?ve purchased low-quality fuel. Let?s look at these possibilities in-depth.1. Lean Air Fuel Mixture (Main Reason)Fuel Injector SprayThe engine needs to have the perfect balance of air and fuel to run correctly. When the engine runs with too much air in the mixture, it?s defined as running lean. The trouble with this problem is that multiple malfunctions can cause it. Let?s look at a few more of the most common issues. 2. Low Fuel Pressure (Lean Air-Fuel Mixture)When a car has low fuel pressure, the engine runs lean. There?s too much air mixing with the fuel in the combustion chamber. Low fuel pressure can overheat the spark plugs, causing the white residue. Low fuel pressure also leads to performance issues and a Check Engine Light. If the pressure is too low, the car won?t start at all. 3. Bad Engine Sensor (Lean Air-Fuel Mixture)Multiple engine sensors keep the engine running balanced and optimized. These sensors are consistently measuring the flow of air and fuel while making necessary adjustments.If one of the sensors fails to read properly, it can throw off the mixture. Some of the most defective sensors include oxygen sensors or mass airflow sensors. 4. Bad Fuel Pump (Lean Air-Fuel Mixture)Cars Fuel PumpIf the fuel pump fails to provide the right amount of flow and pressure at the rail or above the regulator, a lean-running condition can occur. This will set the Check Engine Light and put a code in the system, but it may be generic.Additionally, a dirty fuel filter could be to blame. This problem causes many of the same symptoms as a bad fuel pump. 5. Old Spark PlugsAs the spark plugs become old and corroded, they can no longer ignite the air-fuel mixture normally. Combustion won?t occur correctly, causing an ignition delay. This problem creates a heat explosion. You may have also chosen low-quality spark plugs. If the thermal range isn?t right for your engine, white substances can start to build up on the tip. 6. Low-Quality FuelIf you don?t use top-tier fuel, you don?t know the quality of what you?ve put in the tank. With 145,000 fueling stations in America, you have a lot of places to choose from when the tank is empty.If you choose fuel that has inadequate additives or has been sitting for a while, white deposits can form on the spark plugs. It can also contribute to wear of the fuel system, oxygen sensors and catalytic converter. "
How To Fix White Spark Plug Tips ?	"As professionals, we know what to do at the first sign of white spark plug tips. The key is figuring out what to do as a home mechanic, so you can also protect your engine from wear. Here are some tips to follow.1. Replace Spark PlugsReplace Spark PlugsThere?s no reason to continue using the contaminated spark plug. At this point, you want to replace them and put in a new set, even if it?s not time yet. Depending on what type of plugs you use, the replacement time can be anywhere from 30,000 to 150,000 miles.Can you change the spark plugs yourself? It depends on how the engine is configured. Some vehicles have spark plugs in the front, where they are easy to reach, while others are in strange locations. The last thing you want to deal with is a broken spark plug, so move on to step number five if you aren?t sure how to get them out. 2. Read Trouble CodesDiagnose CarIf the Check Engine Light has come on, a code has been set in the engine. This code can offer a lot of insight into the state of the engine. With your compatible code scanner, read the DTCs to see what?s going on.We have a handy online trouble code library that deciphers the most common faults. The chances are that the code will lead you to determine the mixture is lean, which brings us to the next step. 3. Diagnose and Fix the Lean Air-Fuel MixtureWe?ve discussed the various parts that can lead to an imbalanced air-fuel mixture. Now it?s your job to figure out what?s causing it. The trouble codes may be able to help you figure it out. By reading the trouble codes, you should get a clue of what is causing the lean air-fuel mixture.If not, we recommend getting a factory service manual for your vehicle. It will lead you through all of the steps needed for diagnosis and also includes handy diagrams. 4. Use Better FuelIf the issue is the fuel you are using, it?s time to switch providers. We?ve seen the benefits of using top-tier fuel and recommend it to everyone we come in contact with. It has the best detergents included, sure to keep the engine running its best.Many of the top stations now offer top-tier fuel. Simply look for the sticker on the pump, showing the promise the location has made to provide only the best fuel. 5. Contact A ProfessionalThe last thing you want to do is make matters worse. If you are looking at this guide and feel clueless, stop now and call a professional. There?s too much that can go wrong when working with spark plugs and the engine. It?s not worth saving a few bucks if you make a bigger problem for yourself. "
What Color Should the Tip of a Spark Plug Be?	"The spark plug should have a light gray or brown firing end. If that?s what you see, everything is good and the plug is functioning as intended.Otherwise, there are conditions that should cause alarm. Here are a few to consider.Ash deposits: from using fuel additives or when the piston rings are wornCarbon (wet or dry): insulation resistance between the shell and center electrode is reaching more than 10 ohms. Glossy/glazed: the spark plug has overheated and has melted deposits on the tip. Green: oxidation has occurredOily: oil is seeping into the combustion chamber due to worn rings or valve sealsRed: discolored because of unleaded fuel additivesYellow-brown: lead fouling has occurred The spark plugs can tell a lot about the condition of a car. For that reason, it doesn?t hurt to inspect them occasionally, especially if the engine doesn?t seem to be running right. "
What is the white ceramic on the spark plugs?	"The ceramic material is the spark plug insulator. It?s a white body that wraps itself around the main terminal, which is made from an aluminum oxide composition. This insulator is meant to stand up against the pressure and heat created by the voltage that?s passing through the spark plug. "
Are white spark tips good?	"No, the white tips show that the spark plugs are getting too hot. In most cases, the problem is caused by a lean air-fuel mixture. The car may have a bad engine sensor, a failing fuel pump or low pressure. It could also be due to old plugs or that you have used poor-quality fuel. "
What do rich mixture spark plugs look like?	"When the air-fuel mixture is too rich, the spark plug tip becomes blacker. It can also have a glossy finish to it, indicating there?s too much fuel in the combustion chamber. What you want to see is a light gray or brown firing end, which is what a good spark plug contains. "
What does the spark plug color tell you?	"Because the spark plug has everything to do with igniting the air-fuel mixture in the cylinder, you can tell how the engine is running by looking at the tip. If everything is running as it should, the spark plug tip will be light gray or brown on the firing end. Otherwise, there?s a mechanical problem. "
Conclusion	"You don?t need to be an engine whisperer to know when something is wrong. The spark plug tip end is going to indicate a problem, maybe even before you notice any other symptoms. By performing regular maintenance and paying attention to how the engine runs, you can head off major problems before the repairs get too costly.At the first sign of trouble, inspect the spark plug tip. If they are white, try figuring out what?s causing the engine to run lean. If you need more help, go ahead and reach out to your local mechanic because your car is worth it. "
How Much Horsepower Does A Camshaft Add?	"On average, the camshaft alone may add 10 to 20 horsepower, which is normally about a 5% to 10% increase. Many performance camshaft companies claim to provide 50 to 100 more horsepower, but that?s only after completing a series of other modifications with the new cam. Performance camshafts increase horsepower because the timing of the valve openings is increased. When this timing is adjusted, the car accelerates quicker. This upgrade also produces a slightly rougher idle, giving the engine a rumble that many enthusiasts prefer. "
What Does A Performance Camshaft Do?	"The automotive camshaft is responsible for opening and closing the valves that allow the mixture of air and fuel to flow through. With a stock camshaft, the automaker is focused on creating a nice balance of performance and fuel economy.With an aftermarket camshaft, you can focus solely on performance without worrying so much about efficiency. By adjusting the timing of the valves, more air and fuel can flow through for increased power output. However, to fully benefit from the upgraded cam, other modifications need to be performed to keep the increased flow from bottlenecking in other locations. "
How Does A Camshaft Work In An Engine?	"The cam is a rotating shaft responsible for activating the cylinder?s intake and exhaust valves. As the camshaft turns, the cams push down on the intake valve that?s spring-loaded. This camshaft turns because it?s connected to the crankshaft via the timing belt or chain. The lobes are some of the integral parts of the camshaft. When the camshaft is spinning, the lobes open and close the valves to move in accordance with the pistons. There?s a direct relation between how the engine performs to how the lobes are shaped. At different speeds, the lobes should be a varying shape, but they aren?t. That?s why each camshaft is perfectly designed with one speed in mind. When operating the engine at other speeds, the camshaft won?t be working to its full potential. You may have heard of several types of camshaft designs. For example, do you know the difference between the single and double overhead camshaft? With a (SOHC), there?s one cam per head. With your inline four- or six-cylinder engine, it often only has one cam, while the V6 or V8 has two (one for each head).In comparison, the DOHC engine contains two cams per head. With this design, the inline engines have two, while the V motors have four. This design allows for more intake and exhaust valves, providing a freer flow and more power. There?s also a pushrod engine used by some manufacturers. In this motor, the valves are also found in the head above the cylinder. The difference is that the camshaft is in the engine block instead of in the head. "
Is A Performance Camshaft Worth It?	"For many reasons, a performance camshaft can be beneficial. It?s going to increase horsepower slightly and improve low-end torque. It also increases the RPM range and changes the overall sound. However, if you aren?t willing to make other upgrades with the camshaft, you may not be impressed with the benefits. To get the full advantage of your work, you?ll want to make as many modifications as possible. "
what are the Performance Camshaft Types ?	"As you shop for a camshaft, you?ll notice they are listed in different stages. However, after a deeper inspection, you find the stages don?t mean as much about the camshaft as they do about what else needs to be done to the vehicle.1. Stage 1 This performance camshaft will add an average of 10 to 20 horsepower without any other modifications. It?s the lowest-cost option if you are looking to move away from the stock camshaft.This camshaft is good for increasing power while still maintaining on-road manners and drivability. You can use this cam with your stock intake manifold, torque converters and exhaust manifold. 2. Stage 2You won?t see a much larger horsepower increase with the stage 2 cam. If you perform all of the necessary upgrades, you may be able to achieve up to a 20% increase.With this camshaft, you want to upgrade the exhaust and remap the ECU. Once you?ve accomplished those tasks, the camshaft will provide the maximum output it?s rated for. 3. Stage 3With a stage 3, you gain up to 20% more power, depending on what type of vehicle you drive. You will need to complete all of the stage 2 modifications before you can upgrade to this level.Many of these camshafts can still use the stock throttle body and some other stock components. This stage may require a valve spring, along with a retainer upgrade, because of the added lift, extra duration and larger RPM range.4. Stage 4To achieve maximum power, you want a Stage 4 camshaft. You get a maximum horsepower boost, along with a lower RPM torque and plenty of peak power. However, you are going to need to make some major upgrades to make this camshaft work well. For example, many of these cams require aftermarket cylinder heads too. "
Camshaft Buying Guide: Other Considerations	"Camshaft TypeCamshafts come in four basic types, depending on the lifter type. Your camshaft may have a solid roller, solid flat tappet, hydraulic roller or a hydraulic flat tappet.To determine what?s best for your vehicle, you need to know what type it uses. Most reliable retailers have a fitment chart to determine what camshafts work with each vehicle. Basic Operating RPM RangeThe operating RPM range is the area where the engine performs its best. It?s often referred to as the ?sweet spot? by enthusiasts.When choosing a camshaft, you want one that matches the RPM range of the other components you have installed or are planning on adding. With all of the components working together in harmony, you will notice maximum power output. LiftThe lift measurement refers to the distance that the valve lifts off its seat. This measurement is listed at thousandths of an inch. This lift shows how tall the lobes are. If you hear other enthusiasts talking about a ?bigger cam,? it?s because of the lift and duration measurements.DurationDuration shows how much time the valve is off the seat. It?s measured as degrees of crankshaft rotation. Basically, the duration reveals how wide the lobes are. Again, you don?t need to think about this measurement as much if the website you are purchasing from has fitment specs. Lobe Separation AngleThe Lobe Separation Angle (LSA) shows the distance between the exhaust and intake lobes? centerline. The measurement is shown as degrees of camshaft rotation. With the LSA, you know where the lobes are on the cam. The LSA has a lot to do with horsepower output and drivability. Camshaft Upgrade CostOn average, you can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 on a performance camshaft. In addition to that, you also have the labor charges unless you can put on the camshaft yourself. This may add another $750 to $1,200 to your shop bill. Additionally, if you need to make further upgrades, all of these are in addition to what you are spending on the camshaft. You can have some parts installed at the same time and possibly reduce some of the labor costs. However, the best way to save money is to perform the work yourself if you are comfortable doing so.The overall cost depends heavily on what type of vehicle you drive and what camshaft you purchase. Where you live also plays a part in how much money you will spend on labor. "
Do camshafts increase horsepower?	"Yes, performance camshafts can add horsepower to the engine versus the stock cams. However, to get the maximum benefit out of the camshafts, you may need to make some other modifications, ensuring that the increased flow doesn?t bottleneck somewhere else in the system. "
What is the cheapest way to increase horsepower?	Consider upgrading the air intake or putting on a new exhaust system. You can also install a performance tuner or put on a boost controller. We also recommend using a fuel system cleaner and keeping up with regular maintenance to ensure you get all of the power out of the car it can produce. 
What is considered a mild cam?	"The mild cam is going to be slightly bigger than the stock equipment but won?t require a lot of other modifications to work. You can expect to get 10 to 20 more horsepower out of this camshaft, making it a decent value for the money. "
Are Cammed Cars Reliable?	"If you?ve added a high-quality performance cam, you can count on it being reliable. Before you purchase a new camshaft, make sure it is produced by a well-known brand and has good customer reviews. You should also consider having it professionally installed if you aren?t sure what you are working with. "
Is it illegal to install a performance camshaft?	"Some states have regulations about adding a performance camshaft. For example, if you are driving in California, the camshaft and many other modifications must have a CARB certification number to be considered street-legal. Any modification could lead to a ticket or impound of your vehicle. "
Conclusion	"If you are ready to push out maximum power from your vehicle, it?s time to consider a camshaft upgrade. When you pair a performance camshaft with other modifications, you can see a dramatic difference in horsepower output. However, these modifications do cost money and will take time to complete, so you need to determine if they are worth it to you.If you are driving your car to get to work every day, you may not feel the need to spend the money. However, if your vehicle is performance-focused and you want more speed for a little thrill, go for it. Just be careful not to get carried away with the speeds or you may find yourself with a ticket."
What To Do After Replacing Mass Air Flow Sensor?	"In many car models, you can?t simply put a new mass air flow sensor in and expect everything to run smoothly. First, you must inspect the installation and reset the trouble codes. After this, the ECU needs to be reset, so you should start the vehicle and let it idle. It?s also wise to take a good test drive afterward.However, in some car models, it will be enough to just replace the mass air flow sensor. But, if you want to be sure to make everything properly or have issues after the MAF sensor replacement, check out this. Let?s break down each of these steps a little further. 1. Inspect the InstallationCheck Maf Sensor ReplacementAfter the new MAF sensor is installed, it?s important to double-check all of the connections. When you reconnect the new sensor to the airbox and intake hose, it could remain loose, which would lead to trouble.It?s also important to avoid touching the element in the MAF sensor. It?s fragile and can lead to damage if handled. 2. Reset Trouble CodesScan Trouble Codes CarWhen the mass air flow sensor was bad, your car?s ECU sent out a diagnostic trouble code to get your attention. This process would have turned on the Check Engine Light. To get that light off now, you need to reset the trouble codes.With your code scanner, you can reset the system. Once the system is reset, the Check Engine Light shouldn?t come back on unless there is still a problem. 3. Clear/Relearn Data (If Possible With Your Scanner)The ECU requires a reset to adjust the air-fuel mixture properly. If you fail to do this, the engine could run rich or lean, meaning the mixture is imbalanced. Sometimes, it?s easy to force a relearn with your code scanner if it?s a high-end model. Otherwise, you must perform the relearn manually.Some people opt to disconnect the car battery. However, when you do this, all of the radio presets, seat memory and clock settings will also be erased. If you still choose to move forward with disconnection, leave it for a few minutes before putting everything back. You?ll want to move on to the next steps once the battery is reconnected. However, in many cases the car can relearn the data itself with the new MAF sensor, but it may take some time, depending on the car model. So the best way is always to clear the data manually.4. Start the VehicleStart EngineTo complete the relearning process, the vehicle must be started. Crank the engine and let it run. As you move on to the next step, you can reset all of the features that were disconnected.You will need to put in new radio presets, change the clock and mess with any seat memory. All of these were wiped out when you unplugged the car battery. 5. Let the Vehicle Idle for 10 MinutesOnce the engine is running, the car needs to idle for a little. We recommend idling the car for about ten minutes. While idling, the ECU is relearning the air-fuel mixture. By giving it this time, the ride will be much smoother. 6. Test DriveWith all of the other steps completed, you are ready to take the car for a drive. Stay close to home at first, just in case there?s a problem. Keep the radio off, so you can hear how the engine is running. If the Check Engine Light comes back on or you notice any performance issues, you want to take a closer look at the sensor again. "
What To Do if the Problem Still Occurs After Replacing the Mass Air Flow Sensor?	"It?s disheartening to spend time replacing the mass air flow sensor only to still have trouble. We understand the frustration as we have done it ourselves. That?s why we?ve put together these helpful steps to get you back on track. Whether the Check Engine Light comes on or you notice performance issues, follow these tips.1. Read Trouble Codes Again Get your OBDII code scanner back out and plug it in again. If you don?t have one, the local auto parts stores may read the codes for free.The trouble with engine codes is understanding what they mean. With our trouble code library, you can get some professional advice on the most common codes. 2. Check a Repair ManualWith a factory service manual, you can read all of the recommended procedures when performing an MAF sensor replacement. It?s always possible that you hooked something up wrong or made a mistake.Compare your procedure with what?s outlined in the book. You can also find a lot of this information by performing a search online. 3. Look for Technical Service BulletinsEvery automaker issues technical service bulletins that reveal common issues with the model. These bulletins are meant for the dealership service departments but are free to look at.Simply go to the NHTSA website and enter your VIN into the search bar. Your particular make and model will come up, along with the recalls, current investigations and service bulletins.4. Contact A ProfessionalWhen all else fails, it?s time to get help from a professional. Your local auto repair shop can figure out what?s going on because they have more advanced diagnostic tools than you probably have at home.Search for a reliable mechanic in your area to speak with. For the cost of the repair, you may wonder why you didn?t just go this route, to begin with. "
How long does it take for a new MAF sensor to work?	"Once the new MAF sensor is installed, you may still need a little time until the system relearns the air-fuel mixture. Erase the trouble codes, start the engine and let it idle for at least ten minutes before driving. This should provide adequate time for a reset. "
How do I reset a mass air flow sensor?	"Many high-end code scanners provide the option to reset the sensor. If not, you can disconnect the battery for a few minutes, start the engine and let it idle for at least ten minutes. This procedure helps the ECU relearn the air-fuel mixture for optimal performance. "
Does a MAF sensor need to be calibrated?	"The ECU needs to relearn the proper air-fuel mixture once the MAF sensor has been replaced. You can do this with a professional code scanner or let the engine idle for a short time. Once the MAF sensor has been recalibrated, the car should run as it did before the failure. "
Should I disconnect the battery when changing the mass air flow sensor?	"If you aren?t able to use a code scanner for the relearn procedure, you may need to disconnect the battery. However, when you disconnect the battery, you will have other issues to deal with. The radio presets need to be reprogrammed and the clock will reset. "
Conclusion	"When the time comes to perform a MAF sensor replacement, you have more to think about than simply putting in a new part. As experienced mechanics, we understand how cumbersome it can be to walkthrough the relearning process. If you weren?t expecting this, you might find it to be annoying.However, once the procedures are complete, your car should run like new again. The mass air flow sensor helps to regulate the air-fuel mixture for superior performance. "
What Are The Symptoms Of A Bad DPFE Sensor?	"The main symptoms of a bad DPFE Sensor include:Poor engine performanceReduced fuel economyFailed Emissions TestsCheck engine lightHere is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing DPFE sensor to look for:1. Poor Engine PerformanceSlow Acceleration CarWhen the DPFE sensor fails, the engine can?t run as it was designed. In fact, engine performance issues are the first sign that something is wrong with this sensor. With a faulty sensor, the wrong information is sent back to the engine?s computer. Because of this bad data, the EGR system malfunctions. With this system not running properly, you will notice reduced power and a rough idle. 2. Reduced Fuel EconomyFor your vehicle to receive the EPA-estimated fuel economy numbers, everything must be running perfectly in the engine. With a failed DPFE sensor, that isn?t going to happen.With the computer receiving the wrong information, the motor is going to work harder to compensate for the faults. This extra effort requires more fuel, which is why you might start spending more time at the gas station. 3. Failed Emissions TestsThe DPFE sensor is required for a well-running EGR system. When the EGR system isn?t running as it should, the vehicle will fail an emissions test.Every state has laws about emissions tests, often required for registration. If your vehicle can?t pass the emissions test, you might have trouble driving legally and you are contributing to more pollution in the environment. 4. Check Engine LightWhen the computer system recognizes a problem, the Check Engine Light comes on. In this case, the fault is related to a malfunctioning EGR pressure sensor signal. However, a Check Engine Light alone doesn?t indicate a faulty DPFE sensor. In fact, this light comes on whenever there is a problem with the motor. The only way to know for sure is with an OBDII code scanner. Ford DPFE Sensor FunctionDpfe SensorThe DPFE sensor stands for Differential Pressure Feedback of EGR. It?s also called the Delta Pressure Feedback of EGR because ?Delta? means change. In all situations, the DPFE sensor is used to monitor the pressure changes of the EGR system.The EGR system is the Exhaust Gas Recirculation system. It is the process used to suck exhaust gas back into the motor so it can burn again. This modern technology helps to reduce pollutants coming from the vehicle. When the gases come through the EGR tube, the two tubes that attach to the DPFE sensor are pressurized. The DPFE sensor determines the difference in pressures between the two tubes to determine how much gas is flowing through the system. This information is then sent to the PCM so the actuator can be controlled better, allowing the proper amount of gas through. Without the DPFE sensor, the wrong information is sent, leading to an imbalance of the exhaust gases. You will find the DPFE sensor in Ford engines like the ford ranger, expedition, taurus, escape, focus, and many more. You can also find it in some lincoln cars."
where the DPFE Sensor Location ?	"The DPFE sensor is often located near the EGR valve. This valve is found behind the upper intake manifold, which is between the motor and the firewall. The DPFE sensor is often shaped like a small square. You will see two vacuum hoses attached to the bottom and there is a wiring harness coming from its side. However, the exact location can vary based on what model vehicle you drive. Therefore, it?s best to consult your service manual for a diagram and the exact location. "
DPFE Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"The cost to replace a DPFE sensor and EGR valve range from $150 to $500. The parts tend to make up the majority of the cost, usually between $100 and $400, while the labor might only be $50 to $100. However, replacing the DPFE sensor is a simple task that can be done with a few everyday tools. You shouldn?t drive with a faulty DPFE sensor. If you are noticing a rough idle or a lack of engine power, it?s best to replace the DPFE sensor and EGR valve. Leaving the car with a faulty EGR system only causes trouble passing emissions tests and leads to further air pollution."
How do you check a Ford DPFE sensor?	"You can use an ordinary multimeter to check the DPFE sensor in your Ford and see if it is malfunctioning. Start by locating the sensor, which is somewhere near the EGR system, and back-probe the signal pin. Then, set the multimeter on DC Volts, turn on the ignition, and measure the voltage. You should see approximately 5 volts, with anything significantly different suggesting a defective DPFE sensor. Additionally, you can carry out a resistance test when the ignition is off, with expected values ranging from 150 to 300 ohms."
What does the DPFE sensor do?	"The DPFE sensor measures the gas flow through a pipe connecting the exhaust and the EGR system. It does this by measuring the pressure before and after the orifice inside the said pipe. Based on this data, the PCM assesses the flow through the EGR system and, when needed, regulates it with an EGR control valve. This system is most commonly used in Ford?s vehicles with Modular gasoline 4.6 and 5.4-liter V8 engines."
How do I know if the DPFE sensor is bad?	"A faulty DPFE sensor will likely trigger a check engine light, meaning there will be a corresponding error code in the vehicle?s memory. Some codes you may expect to see if this is the case include P0401, P1401, or P1406. In addition, you may experience rough idle, stalling, and poor fuel economy. Moreover, your car will likely fail its emission test. But before blaming this on the DPFE sensor, you should first check the connector, wiring, and the EGR system itself. Sometimes, the pipings and hoses may be clogged up with soot, which completely blocks the flow of exhaust gases."
What would causes a DPFE sensor to melt?	"Several things can cause the DPFE sensor to melt, with an internal electrical malfunction being one of them. This may cause increased resistance or short circuit, which heats up the sensor and melts it if the temperature becomes high enough. The same might happen because of heat exposure if the DPFE sensor is installed too close to the exhaust. Lastly, the EGR system, if clogged, may become too hot and melt the surrounding components."
Conclusion	"Most modern cars have an EGR system, which is short for Exhaust Gas Recirculation. This emission-control device returns the portion of burnt gases back into the engine to reduce the exhaust?s NOx content. But because the system may clog up with soot buildups, the flow of gasses through it is monitored.Most Ford models made in the early 2000s use a DPFE system, which is short for Differential Pressure Feedback of EGR. It uses a sensor to measure pressure differences at different points of the EGR system, which is then used to assess the flow. This sensor and connecting hoses may fail, which can result in incorrect readings and engine running issues."
What is PowerBoost?	What is PowerBoost?
What Is PowerStroke?	"PowerStroke is another trademark of Ford, but it?s a completely different kind of engine. This label is put on a lineup of diesel engines. These diesel motors have been in production since 1994. You can find a variety of displacements for these motors as well, including the 3.0-liter and the 7.3-liter. Sadly, there is no longer a PowerStroke option with the F-150 lineup. The final option was with the 2021 F-150 models that include the 3.0-liter PowerStroke. If you have a local dealership near you, it may still be possible to find a new, leftover F-150 with a PowerStroke engine. Otherwise, you might be stuck purchasing a used truck. "
Differences Between PowerBoost and PowerStroke?	"Aside from one engine being a gas-powered model while the other is a diesel, there are some significant differences between PowerBoost and PowerStroke. The performance, fuel economy, compression ratio and durability all vary. The model years, maintenance requirements and costs are also important to evaluate.1. PerformanceFord RaptorThe Ford PowerBoost engine is a turbocharged motor that provides 400 horsepower and 570 pound-feet of torque. It?s designed to create fast acceleration and great top speeds. This motor is brand-new with the 2021 model year and only comes as a V6 variant. On the other hand, the PowerStroke is a diesel engine and it also creates a lot of torque, designed for towing and hauling. It can be found in a variety of variants because it has been available for so long. Over the years, it?s offered the highest levels of towing and hauling capability, which is why it?s been a favorite among workers around the country. 2. Fuel EconomyAccording to Ford, the PowerBoost engine provides up to 700 miles per gas tank. The EPA further gives the PowerBoost F-150 ratings of 25/25 mpg city/highway. It?s difficult to find a truck with numbers such as these, making this hybrid engine one of the best choices for saving fuel. PowerStroke engines are found in the entire F-Series lineup. With the direct injection and turbocharged design, these motors do add some efficiency, especially when compared with gas engines. However, ratings vary by what type of PowerStroke engine is included. For example, the EPA determined that the 2021 Ford F-150 could earn 20/27 mpg with the PowerStroke motor. Overall, the hybrid motor is going to provide the best fuel efficiency. In the coming years, the technology will get even better, adding to more miles per gallon. Of course, it will never compete with the new F-150 Lightning, which is the company?s all-electric truck, but it does come in a close second. 3. Compression RatioThe term compression ratio defines the measurement of compressing the maximum cylinder volume into the minimum cylinder volume. It?s the volume of the cylinder with the piston all the way down in relation to when it?s all the way up. These are written as a ratio, but said written out. For example, the compression ratio of the PowerBoost engine is 10.5:1, which is said as ?ten point five to one.? PowerStroke engines have a range of compression ratios depending on which model you are looking at. For example, the 6.9 is 20.7 to 1, while the 7.3 is 21.5 to 1.4. DurabilityFord TerrainIt?s difficult to gauge the durability of the PowerBoost engines because it is so new. Time will tell how well this engine holds up, but enthusiasts are hopeful. On the other hand, we know how the PowerStroke fares. Some models were duds, while others are highly coveted. From a personal standpoint, we aren?t big fans of the 6.0L but would knock down doors to get the 7.3L.5. Model YearsThere?s a big difference between what models include each of these engines. You can only find the PowerBoost engine on newer Ford trucks. It?s been available since 2021 on the F-150 and Maverick trucks. In the future, it might be offered on more models.As far as the PowerStroke engine is concerned, you can no longer get it with new F-150 trucks. Yet, because of how long the engine has been around, it?s still easy to find with used models. There have been a variety of PowerStroke engines over the years, so you won?t have trouble hunting one down.If you want a new PowerStroke engine, there is still an option. The Ford Super Duty lineup continues to be built with this engine and doesn?t offer the hybrid motor. You have to spend a lot more to drive a Super Duty and it might be overkill for your needs, but it?s all that?s available if a new PowerStroke is what matters the most to you. There?s very little likelihood that the Super Duty will be offered with the hybrid engine any time soon. 6. Maintenance RequirementsThe PowerBoost engine requires the same amount of maintenance as any gas-powered motor. You will need to change the oil and filters regularly. In a few years, we will have a better idea about how much time and money is spent on repairs.With the PowerStroke engine, the maintenance costs can be adequately measured. While you will perform normal diesel engine maintenance for any model, the 6.0L is going to require more care. If you have this PowerStroke motor, prepare to spend more on repairs and upkeep. 7. CostAs with any engine purchase, the diesel motor is going to be more expensive to the manufacturer, which gets passed on to the customer. With that said, the cost of these trucks is a better investment. Unlike gas-powered trucks, the diesel pickup is going to retain its value better. Even years later, you can still expect a great resale value for your diesel Ford. "
Is PowerStroke or PowerBoost Engines Better?	"How do you choose between the PowerBoost and PowerStroke engines? If you are purchasing a brand-new F-150, you won?t have much of a choice, since the PowerStroke is no longer included on new F-150 truck models. Other than that, there are several criteria used to determine what?s best. If you want the option that?s best for the environment, the Ford PowerBoost would be a good choice. It?s efficient and better for today?s modern age.On the other hand, the PowerStroke motor can be extremely reliable and it retains its resale value. You just have to be careful which diesel engine you choose, as some variants aren?t nearly as reliable as others. You will also need to pay more for a truck with a diesel engine compared to one that?s gas-powered or a hybrid. It might require saving up some money to get the pickup that you want. "
Is the Ford PowerBoost good?	"The Ford PowerBoost engine is a brand-new hybrid motor, just released in 2021. It?s equipped with some F-150 trucks and provides 400 horsepower. The quick acceleration and superior power make it a favorite among enthusiasts, but it could take a few years before we know how reliable it is. "
Will Superduty get PowerBoost?	"The Super Duty trucks are expected to undergo some changes for the 2023 model year. However, at this time, all reports suggest that the PowerBoost engine won?t be one of these changes. The motor options seem to remain the same with the new Super Duty lineup. "
Is the Ford PowerBoost a turbo?	"The Ford PowerBoost engine is a 3.5-liter turbocharged V6 hybrid motor that pumps out 400 horsepower. It?s also rated for 570 lb-ft of torque, ensuring superior acceleration and plenty of pulling power. It?s available on 2021 Ford trucks. "
What can a PowerBoost tow?	"Starting with the 2021 Ford F-150 lineup, the 3.5-liter PowerBoost hybrid V6 engine allows for up to 12,700 pounds of maximum towing capacity. Additionally, the maximum payload capacity is up to 1,321 pounds when properly equipped. "
Conclusion	"It might seem like a difficult decision to choose between the PowerBoost vs. PowerStroke, but it shouldn?t be. The PowerBoost engine is a hybrid configuration, while the PowerStroke is diesel-powered. Of course, these are just the main differences between the two Ford engines. To determine what?s best for you, it?s necessary to look at all of the similarities and differences first."
What Is Piston Slap?	"Piston slap happens when the piston rocks in the cylinder. Instead of solely moving up and down as it should, it rocks back and forth. In many cases, it means that too much room exists within the cylinder for the piston.See the following image:Piston SlapWhen everything operates normally, the piston should be held in place by the walls. As the skirt of the piston hits the cylinder walls, knocking and rattling occur. As cars age, piston slap presents itself because of normal wear and tear. In many cases, the noise is louder during idling. As I mentioned before, piston slap is very rare in newer car models, so I strongly recommend doing a proper diagnosis before taking the engine apart."
What Does Piston Slap Sound Like?	"Piston slap is a knocking sound that can occur in an engine. It typically occurs when the engine is cold and the pistons are still expanding due to heat. The sound is caused by the piston rocking back and forth in the cylinder, making contact with the cylinder wall.The sound of piston slap is often described as a sharp metallic knocking noise that increases with engine speed. It can be heard from under the hood and may also be accompanied by a vibration felt in the steering wheel or the vehicle's body.It's important to note that other engine issues can also cause knocking or ticking sounds, so it's best to have a trained mechanic diagnose the issue to determine the exact cause of the noise."
What Causes Piston Slap?	"The main cause of piston slap is worn pistons or cylinder walls, creating a too big of a distance between the piston and the cylinder wall. When the piston to wall clearance becomes too large, the piston begins rocking side to side, creating what is known as piston slap.It happens more frequently with aluminum blocks than iron. Additionally, piston slap might be louder when the engine is first started because of extra cold clearance. In modern vehicles, the ECU will alert you if the piston variations are off at all. Sadly, the only way to deal with a piston slap is to figure out what is causing it and repair the problem.1. Check Engine LightIf the piston begins to fail, you might see the Check Engine Light come on. With modern vehicles, the onboard diagnostic system sends out an error code when something is wrong.With an OBDII scanner, you should be able to see the exact cylinder that is affected. However, knocking can also be caused by other issues, such as a dirty fuel injector or trouble in the ignition system. 2. Burnt PistonFuel injectors can get dirty over time. If left unchecked, a dirty fuel injector can lead to a hole in the top of the piston.Additionally, using the wrong spark plugs can lead to burnt pistons. The only way to see this problem is to open up the top of the engine."
How to Fix Piston Slap ?	"Understanding what piston slap is helps you figure out how to fix it. You will need to determine what has caused the problem to completely repair it. Start by checking the pistons to see what condition they are in. This requires you to take apart the engine. If you don?t have the experience for this, you want to take your vehicle to a licensed mechanic.In most cases, piston slap is caused by the pistons themselves knocking on the cylinders. In this case, the only way to fix the problem is to get a new piston. Prior to this fix, you need to perform an engine compression test. If there are other issues with the engine, or if your vehicle is older, it might not be worth replacing the piston. If you decide to move forward with a piston replacement, make sure you swap out the rings for new ones. Defective piston rings could have led to some of the problems you are experiencing. Plus, now would be the time to replace the piston rings, anyway, because the engine will already be apart.Replacing a piston can cost $1,000 or more, making it a very expensive repair. That?s why many people with older vehicles choose not to replace the piston at all. At first, the bad piston is going to create a lot of noise, but it might not lead to permanent damage. If you plan to keep your vehicle, you will want to get the piston replaced before it leads to more severe engine damage."
Will piston slap damage an engine?	"A piston slap is damaging to the engine, especially if it?s put under heavy loads while this knocking sound is present. This happens when the gap between the piston and the cylinder is too large. As a result, the piston will start rocking side to side while going up and down, with its sides hitting cylinder walls. This can easily lead to additional mechanical damage, such as scratches and scorches."
Does piston slap go away?	"Piston slap is frequent in older cars, whose engine internals were made with some gaps between them. But in most cases, the unpleasant knocking sound will stop once the engine warms up, as this closes these clearances. Although piston slap is rarer in newer cars, it is a much more serious problem for them, because their engine components are made to much closer tolerances. Here, knocking or rattling sounds from the engine mustn?t be ignored."
What oil is best for piston slap?	"Thicker oil, such as 15W-40 or heavier, may do wonders at curing piston slap. Being more viscous, it seals off the gaps between the cylinders and pistons, preventing them from rocking from one side to another. This method, however, is only acceptable for older engines with no sensitive hydraulic components. With their hydraulic valve lifters or variable-valve-timing solenoids, modern engines wouldn?t work well with such thick oil."
How do I know if my engine has a piston slap?	"Pistons that are slapping will produce a metallic knocking sound whose frequency matches the engine?s speed. At first, this may appear similar to the noise made by noisy valve tappets or failing hydraulic lifers. The difference, however, is that the piston slap will be louder when the engine is under load, and will go away as soon as you back off the throttle."
Can overheating cause piston slap?	"Overheating, in most cases, will not result in a piston slap. In fact, it?s more likely for the pistons to seize inside the cylinders when this happens. This is because they will expand as the engine temperature goes up until there is no room for them to move up and down."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Oil Control Valve (VVT Solenoid) ?	"The most common symptom of a bad VVT solenoid or oil control valve is a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice issues with the performance, like rough idle, rough acceleration, increased fuel consumption, or low engine power.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing oil control valve to look out for:1. Indicating Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light OnWith the help of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU), with which modern vehicles are equipped, you can notice any unusual activity going on in your vehicle via the check engine light.Your ECU monitors and reports any activity going on in your car. If one of the current situations is not compatible with the predefined values, the check engine light comes on.As a result, when the VVT solenoid is not working properly, the check engine light will come on your dashboard.2. Rough IdlingLow Idle RpmThe VVT solenoid adjusts the camshaft timing when your car is running at idle. This is because the idling should be as smooth as possible. A very retarded camshaft timing will make it very difficult for the engine to not drop too low on RPM and stall.If you notice strange idling problems with your car, it can be because of a faulty VVT solenoid.3. Rough AccelerationCar AccelerationThe main purpose of the VVT solenoid is to adjust the camshaft timing so you will have effective and smooth engine operation at all different RPMs. If it fails, you may find it causing your acceleration to become rough, and it might even cause misfires when accelerating.If you have rough acceleration together with a check engine light on your dashboard, it could absolutely be due to a faulty VVT valve.4. Increased Fuel ConsumptionFuel ConsumptionVVT solenoid manages the valves? opening and closing times to ensure that efficient fuel consumption is maintained.Any malfunction of the VVT solenoid is therefore certain to result in efficient fuel consumption. So if you notice the smell of unburned fuel and a significant drop or increase in your average fuel consumption, it is very likely that your variable valve timing sensor is defective.5. Low Engine PerformanceSlow Car AccelerationThe VVT solenoid was innovated to increase the power on higher RPMs while keeping a steady engine performance at lower RPMs. Therefore, a faulty VVT solenoid can cause the performance to drop a lot if it does not advance the camshaft timing during acceleration."
what is the VVT Solenoid Function ?	"Almost all modern cars use VVT technology to improve their performance and fuel economy. The VVT solenoid helps engines change their valve timing, ensuring that the performance is at its top without losing driveability on lower RPMs.Electronic principles of electromagnetism in the form of a solenoid valve control the oil flow to the camshafts. The engine control unit sends power and ground to the VVT solenoid when it is time to open the solenoid and adjust the camshaft timing."
where the VVT Solenoid Location ?	"The VVT solenoid is almost always located in the cylinder head near the camshafts. It is most often located at the intake side because the VVT solenoid is often only installed on the intake camshaft in most car models.Your car might be equipped with two VVT solenoids, and if this is the case, the second VVT solenoid will be on the exhaust camshaft.In some car models, the VVT solenoid is located on the inside of the valve cover, which makes it more difficult to reach."
how to test Oil Control Valve  ?	"Oil control valves (OCV) are electronic components that control the flow of oil to the engine's camshaft and other engine components. A faulty OCV can cause various engine problems such as poor performance, rough idle, and reduced fuel efficiency. Here are some steps you can follow to test an oil control valve:Locate the oil control valve: The OCV is usually located near the engine's camshaft or near the cylinder head.Check the resistance: Disconnect the electrical connector to the OCV and use a digital multimeter to check the resistance across the valve's terminals. Consult the vehicle's service manual for the specific resistance value for the OCV. If the resistance is outside the recommended range, the OCV may be faulty.Check the operation: Reconnect the electrical connector to the OCV and start the engine. Observe the engine for any rough idling, reduced performance or other problems. Also, use a scan tool to check for any error codes related to the OCV. If the OCV is not functioning properly, the engine's performance will be affected.Inspect the valve: Remove the OCV and inspect it for any visible signs of damage or wear. Clean the valve and check that it moves freely.If you have tested the OCV and found it to be faulty, it will need to be replaced. It's best to consult with a professional mechanic if you are unsure about performing any of these steps."
what is the VVT Solenoid Replacement Cost ?	"The average VVT solenoid replacement cost is between $100 and $500. You can expect labor costs of $50-300 depending on the car model, and the part itself costs between $50-300.With VVT solenoids, there is a large price variance depending on the car you have. For some car models, you have to take half the engine apart; for others, it can be replaced within 5 minutes. You will find detailed information in your repair manual."
Can I drive with a bad VVT solenoid?	"While you could drive your car even if its VVT solenoid is faulty, this will not be a pleasant experience. Depending on the situation, this failure will cause various running issues, such as rough idle or poor acceleration. Whatever the symptoms, the engine will not run at its optimal level, increasing fuel consumption greatly. In the long run, unattended VVT issues may lead to additional engine damage."
Can a bad VVT cause engine knock?	"Yes. The engine may start knocking and pinging if one or both of its VVT solenoids fail. This will happen if a VVT malfunction causes the air/fuel mixture to become so lean that it pre-ignites during combustion. Pre-ignition is severely damaging, so you shouldn?t drive your car if its engine is knocking."
Does low oil affect VVT?	"It?s highly likely that the VVT system in your car will malfunction if the engine oil level is low. The same might happen if the oil is of insufficiently high quality, or if it hasn?t been changed for a long time. Variable Valve Timing, or VVT, is a hydro-mechanic system, whose operation relies on pressurized engine oil. Because of that, even the slightest deviation in pressure or flow may interfere with the VVT solenoid?s operation."
Does the VVT solenoid affect idle?	"By adjusting the airflow through the engine, VVT solenoids affect its whole rev range, including the idle. So, if the VVT solenoid fails, the idle might become rough or, in more severe cases, it may cause stalling. This happens when the camshaft timing is too retarded, which lowers the idle speed too much."
What happens when a VVT solenoid fails?	"Because it affects the operation of intake and exhaust valves, a malfunctioning VVT solenoid will reduce the airflow through the engine. This can cause various running issues, including rough idle, poor acceleration, or reduced engine performance. With any of these symptoms, the engine will not run at its optimal level, which increases fuel consumption."
Conclusion	"Variable Valve Timing, or VVT, is one of the greatest innovations engines have received in recent decades. By adjusting the camshaft timing, this hydro-mechanic system increases the engine?s efficiency and makes its operation smoother. But if it fails, it can cause engine running issues, including rough idle, slow acceleration, misfires, or even knocking."
what are the Causes of  Water is Dripping Out of Your Tailpipe ?	"The most common reason for water dripping from the exhaust pipe is just normal water condensation. Smell or taste the water from the exhaust pipe, and if it does not smell or taste sweet, there is probably nothing to worry about. If it smells sweet, it?s coolant.These causes are the fast list of the main causes of water dripping from the exhaust pipe. Let us take a more in-depth look into the most common causes:1. Water CondensationSmoke From ExhaustThe most obvious reason you will see water coming from the exhaust is due to condensation. This process is completely normal and happens for a variety of reasons.During the internal combustion process, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor are formed. As the gases leave the combustion chamber, gases are mixed with the water molecules. As the engine cools, water condensation often becomes visible, especially from the tailpipe. If the water droplets stop after a few minutes, there?s nothing to worry about. Otherwise, you might have a larger problem on your hands. 2. Catalytic Converter CondensationCatalytic Converter 1 E1609777534665As with the condensation coming from the engine, you may also be dealing with water vapor from the catalytic converter. Remember, the cat is changing the chemical makeup of the gases, thereby creating more water molecules.In the conversion, water vapor can make its way out of the tailpipe. As with the previous condensation, this should resolve itself within a few minutes and is considered a normal function of the exhaust system. 3. Head Gasket FailureHead Gasket On EngineWhile the previous reasons weren?t anything to get alarmed about, a head gasket failure is. If the water coming from your exhaust is due to a blown head gasket, you have a serious problem.The blown head gasket often comes with white smoke coming from the tail pipe and water droplets. You may also see air in the coolant reservoir, or your engine might begin overheating. Either way, you want to get the problem resolved quickly before you need a complete engine replacement. 4. Defective EGR coolerVolkswagen Egr CoolerSome newer car engines, especially diesel engines, use an EGR cooler to cool down the exhaust gases before entering the intake. The coolant cools the exhaust gases, and this part can crack. If the EGR cooler cracks, it can cause coolant to come into the exhaust pipe and drip from the tailpipe.If the water coming from the tailpipe smells sweet, it could definitely be caused by a broken EGR cooler if your car is equipped with one.5. Defective Pistons or RingsPiston Ring FunctionWorn-out piston rings or a bad piston only cause water to come from the tail pipe if the head gasket is also blown or there is already condensation in the exhaust. Additionally, bad pistons and rings can lead to other symptoms.You might notice a sooty exhaust, oily residue coming from the exhaust or blue smoke. Either way, you don?t want to continue driving with bad pistons or rings."
what is the Cost to Fix Water Coming from the Exhaust ?	"If the water is caused by normal condensation, there?s nothing to repair. However, both a blown head gasket and defective pistons or rings should be dealt with immediately.The cost to repair a blown head gasket is between $1,000 and $2,000, but the price is not because of the parts. Instead, this repair takes a long time, leading to higher labor charges. Additionally, the cost to replace defective pistons and rings is between $1,000 and $5,000, mainly because of how labor-intensive the job is. If either of these situations is left unresolved, you will find yourself in need of a complete engine replacement. "
Is it normal for oil to leak from the exhaust?	"Oil leaking from the tailpipe is never a good sign, as it indicates serious engine trouble. The only way for oil to get into the exhaust system is by entering the combustion chamber. Potential causes for this include worn piston rings, damaged valve stem seals, or a faulty PCV valve. But whatever might be causing the problem, you should fix it as soon as possible to prevent any additional damage to the engine or the catalytic converter."
What could cause water to drip from the exhaust pipe while idling?	"In most cases, it?s perfectly normal to have water dripping from the exhaust while the car is idling. This happens because the catalytic converter turns a portion of harmful exhaust gases into water vapor, which may condense inside the exhaust system. Still, coolant leaking into the engine?s combustion chambers shouldn?t be ruled out here. If that?s the case, the watery substance from the tailpipe will feel greasy when you run it between your fingers."
What does brown liquid mean when dripping from exhaust?	"The brown liquid coming from the tailpipe is most likely rust dissolved in water. Cars that are frequently driven on short distances only are usually affected by this issue. This is because the water vapor within exhaust gases condenses against cold muffler walls, which need some time to warm up. The condensed water will gather on the muffler?s bottom, where it will eventually cause corrosion. Taking your car regularly on a longer trip will prevent this from happening, as it will burn out the water from the exhaust."
What could cause water dripping from the muffler?	"Water dripping from the muffler can happen as a part of the vehicle?s normal operation. When running optimally, the engine produces water vapor as a part of its exhaust gases, and this vapor may condense and turn into water while going through exhaust pipes and mufflers. This is especially true if it?s cold outside or the vehicle hasn?t yet reached its running temperature. If this is the case there, water dripping from the exhaust is no reason for concern, especially if you frequently drive your car on short distances."
Conclusion	"When running, the engine generates exhaust gases as a byproduct of the combustion process. One of the exhaust gas components is water vapor, which in most cases, exits through the tailpipe in a gaseous state. However, if the outside temperatures are low or if the car is driven for short distances a lot, this vapor may condense inside its exhaust system.The resulting water can gather up within the muffler, from where it may drip out when the engine is running. While this is perfectly normal, coolant leaking into the engine?s cylinders shouldn?t be ruled out, as this may have a similar effect."
What Is Turbo Lag?	"Turbo lag is the difference in time between when you press the accelerator and when the turbo kicks and delivers extra air to your engine. Understanding why turbo lag exists requires a quick lesson on how turbos work.Turbos work by taking energy from the exhaust with an exhaust impeller and then transferring it to build pressure into the intake pipes with an impeller on the intake side. This extra air increases the amount of power that your vehicle can produce.But since it is quite a big area to build pressure into the intake pipes, it takes a little time to give you the power output you?re looking for. This lag time is called turbo lag."
How Can I Reduce Turbo Lag?	"While you might be thinking you can?t reduce turbo lag since you?re dependent on the vehicle increasing the amount of exhaust before it can effectively use it, you?d be wrong. While it?s impossible to eliminate turbo lag completely, it?s not impossible to reduce it.That?s because your turbo system isn?t 100 percent efficient, and the more efficient you make it, the less turbo lag you?ll have. Below we?ve highlighted three different ways you can reduce turbo lag.1. Downsize Your Exhaust DownpipeIf you?re decreasing your exhausts downpipe, you?re going to decrease your turbo lag, but the tradeoff is that you?re going to reduce your top-end horsepower too. That?s because a smaller downpipe increases the speed of the exhaust, which increases your turbo spooling.While this increases how quickly the turbo can spool, it also decreases overall airflow, which reduces overall turbo effectiveness. You?ll have to find a balance somewhere, but if you have an excessive amount of turbo lag, this can be an effective way to reduce it.2. Upgrade Your Blow-Off ValveUpgrading your blow-off valve is all about improving the effectiveness of your turbo. An upgraded blow-off valve gives you a more responsive unit, decreasing turbo lag and giving you a more effective turbo.However, you might end up increasing the overall amount of noise that your blow-off valve creates. This might not be a big deal to you, but just know that it?s a possibility. Furthermore, know that this is not going to be as effective as downsizing your exhaust downpipe.3. Upgrade Your IntercoolerThe shorter the distance between your exhaust and your turbo, the less turbo lag you?ll have. Some units prioritize the shortest possible pipes over everything else, and if you opt for one of these units, you?ll reduce the amount of turbo lag that you?ll have.Just know that while there are no downsides to upgrading your intercooler and piping, you?re not likely to see significant results when it comes to turbo lag. Instead, you?ll shave hundredths to tenths of a second off your turbo lag time."
What Is Turbo Spool?	"Turbo spool is the time it takes from when the turbo starts building pressure until it reaches full pressure. As you might figure out, it is therefore very different compared to the turbo lag ? the turbo lag is when you press the accelerator pedal until it starts creating power.Also, the turbo spool is determined by the size of the engine and the turbocharger. It can also be increased with things as an improved turbo impeller,"
What causes a turbo to lag?	"Turbocharger, or turbo, as it is commonly called, lags because of the way it works. These pressure-generating devices have blades inside them, which rotate at high speeds as exhaust gases go through. And when you press the throttle, it takes a second or two for these blades to spin up fast enough to create enough pressure."
Do all turbo cars have turbo lag?	"Yes, turbo lag is something all turbocharged cars have, although this is not equally noticeable among them. As a rule of thumb, gasoline engines and those with big turbos will lag more than smaller turbochargers, which will have less boost at higher speeds. Car makers have been trying to get the best of both worlds with technologies like variable vane geometry or twin-scroll turbos."
How do I drive with turbo lag?	"First, keep the engine revs above the speed at which the turbocharger shuts off. For instance, if you need instant throttle response and your turbo kicks in at 2,000 RPM, don?t let the revs go below that limit. If driving a car with a manual transmission, you can do this by shifting into a lower gear. This is also possible in most automatics, where gears may be manually selected."
What makes a turbo spool faster?	"The size of the turbocharger is the most decisive factor here. A bigger turbo will have the capacity to generate a lot of power, but it will take more time to spool up. As opposed, a smaller turbo will spool much faster, but this comes at the expense of high-end performance. Another thing that shortens the spool time is the rear housing size, with smaller being better once again."
How do I get the turbo spool sound?	"The first thing to do is fittin an aftermarket Cold Air Intake from a reputable manufacturer, such as K&N or Roush. This is because stock car intakes are designed to reduce the induction noise and make the car more subtle. Other mods that increase the turbo spool sound include high-flow downpipes, different blow-off valves and ECU tuning."
Conclusion	"A turbocharger is, in effect, a pump that uses exhaust gases to deliver pressurized air to the engine. By doing so, a turbo increases the engine?s power output and improves its overall efficiency. While cars with such engines are smoother and fuel-efficient, they have one downside ? turbo lag.In simple words, this is the time needed between pressing the throttle and the engine actually starting to accelerate. This happens because it takes a second or two for the turbo to spin up fast enough to create enough boost pressure."
What Is The Difference Between a DOHC and SOHC Engine?	"The difference between SOHC and DOHC engines is the number of camshafts in the engine. SOHC stands for a single overhead camshaft engine. DOHC stands for dual overhead camshaft, which means that there are two camshafts in the cylinder head. Most modern motors fit into one of these categories. SOHC = Single Overhead CamshaftDOHC = Dual Overhead CamshaftsThere?s more to evaluate aside from how many camshafts are in each cylinder head. When evaluating the SOHC vs. DOHC engine, we have several factors to consider.Let?s start by looking at the basics of each engine type."
Single Overhead Cam Setup ?	"The single overhead camshaft (SOHC) motor contains a single camshaft in the cylinder head. Depending on what type of motor it is, the camshaft activates the cam followers or the rocker arms to open the intake and exhaust valves.Most of these engines contain two valves, one for the intake and another for the exhaust, or three valves, with two for the exhaust, for each cylinder. However, there is a SOHC design that utilizes four valves in each cylinder, such as the 3.5-liter Honda engine. If the SOHC engine has a flat configuration or is in a V, it contains two cylinder heads. Each of these contains a camshaft. SOHC ProsSimple designFewer parts to failEasy to manufacturerCheaperGood low to mid-range torque powerSOHC ConsRestricted airflowSupports less horsepower Efficiency can suffer"
Dual Overhead Cam Setup	"The dual overhead cam (DOHC) engine contains two camshafts in each cylinder head. The first camshaft runs the intake valves, and the other is in charge of the exhaust valves. With this design, there?s room to include four valves per cylinder or more ? usually two for the intake and two for the exhaust. The majority of DOHC motors have lifter buckets or cam followers that help the camshafts open each of the valves. If the DOHC engine contains two cylinder heads, there will be four total camshafts ? two with each cylinder head. DOHC ProsBetter airflowIncreases horsepower supportBetter high-end torquePermits higher rev limitsRoom for efficient technology upgradesDOHC ConsMore complicated designMore advanced parts ? harder to repairTakes longer to manufactureHigher production costs"
What Is A Camshaft?	"The camshaft is a part of the engine responsible for opening and closing valves. The camshaft handles both the intake and exhaust valves. It must open and close these valves in a synchronized and precise sequence.The shaft contains small bulges that activate the opening of the valve. With this operation, the engine receives the air it needs, and it can expel the necessary exhaust.The camshaft is constructed from cast iron alloy or hardened steel. What forces the camshaft to rotate? There?s either a timing belt or chain that?s responsible for this operation. The timing belt is connected to sprockets at the front of the crankshaft and the car?s camshaft, so they work in harmony. As energy is sent to the crankshaft, it forces the camshaft to move, thereby opening and closing the necessary valves. "
differences between SOHC and DOHC ? Which Is The Better Choice?	"You may wonder which motor configuration is better between the DOHC vs. SOHC. It depends on what factors you examine. To help you decide, we look at five important distinctions between the two engine types.Overall, it seems that the DOHC engine is a better option unless you need something cheap and simple. 1. Fuel EfficiencyIt?s difficult to determine fuel efficiency based on SOHC and DOHC alone because both can be efficient. It all comes down to how the engine was designed. Yes, the SOHC engine contains fewer moving parts, which reduces the overall weight. This alone can lead to better fuel economy. However, the DOHC engine has improved airflow and more control over the engine, making the vehicle efficient too. It?s better to look at fuel efficiency based on the manufacturer. For example, Honda has some insanely efficient SOHC engines, while Toyota is known for making quality DOHC motors. Efficiency is rated based on how the automaker configured the rest of the engine around its valves and camshafts. 2. Maintenance CostsFor the most part, the maintenance costs of the SOHC engine will be lower than the DOHC. In a DOHC engine, there?s a complex belt or chain drive system included, which adds to the expenses. Plus, with double the camshafts, there are more valves to consider. With more parts comes more trouble, too.SOHC engines are less complex. The engines are also cheaper to manufacture, making it easier to rebuild them if something happens. 3. PerformanceThere are multiple reasons that the performance of the DOHC motor is better. For one, there is double the amount of valves. This design allows for the ideal configuration for performance. With a minimum of four valves, there?s better airflow, allowing for a more powerful ride.Valve timing is also efficiently optimized in the DOHC engine. Timing is a critical factor when determining the performance of a vehicle. Newer DOHC engines contain variable valve timing to further enhance the activity.Additionally, the spark plugs on the DOHC motor are found in the middle for streamlined performance. What you find is better ignition and a boost in performance. 4. PriceIt isn?t difficult to figure out which one of the two options is going to be more expensive. The SOHC engine has a single rotating cylindrical rod regulating both the intake and exhaust of the gases. This simple design is going to be much cheaper than the more complicated DOHC engine. Just knowing that the DOHC engine has double the valves should be enough to determine how much more it costs to build. This cost isn?t absorbed by the manufacturer. Instead, it is passed on to the buyer in the MSRP.Beyond the initial sale, these two designs also have a lot to do with prices. If something needs to be repaired on the DOHC motor, it?s going to cost a lot more because of the complicated design. 5. SmoothnessThe SOHC engine contains a single camshaft that regulates both valves. The DOHC engine has a double camshaft design with a dedicated operation for the inlet and exhaust of gases. Because the DOHC contains double the amount of inlet and exhaust valves in comparison with the SOHC engine, you can anticipate a more responsive engine. The DOHC engine equally distributes the operations, allowing for smoother performance. It is also known for creating less noise and for enhancing the ride for most passengers. "
How Do I Know If You Have SOHC or DOHC?	"You don?t need to be an engine expert to figure out what type of motor you have. All you need to do is pop open the hood and take a look at what?s underneath. By looking at the top of your engine, you can learn a lot.If the engine looks narrow and tall, with the hump toward the front for the cam drive sprocket, you likely have a SOHC motor. On the other hand, if the engine is wide and contains two humps, it is most likely a DOHC motor. There are also ways to tell what kind of engine it is without looking under the hood. You can start by doing a VIN search online with the year, make and model. The engine specifications should be easy to find. You can also look in the car?s service manual to see what type of motor it is. When in doubt, give a call to the dealership. By giving the service department the VIN, they can look up the specifications for you. "
Is SOHC more fuel-efficient than DOHC?	"Engine efficiency isn?t rated by whether it is a SOHC or DOHC configuration. There are plenty of SOHC engines that are efficient because of their lighter weight, while DOHC engines can be efficient because of the better airflow and performance. Judge a motor based on the EPA ratings instead of what type of engine is included. "
Is a SOHC or DOHC engine faster?	"The DOHC engine is better equipped for performance. With the improved airflow design and efficient configuration, you can expect more power to come from these engines. However, this performance comes at a cost, as the DOHC is more expensive to manufacture, and this cost gets passed on to the customer. "
Does DOHC mean Turbo?	"No. The DOHC engine has nothing to do with turbochargers. The dual overhead cam (DOHC) engine has two camshafts in each cylinder head. The first camshaft runs the intake valves, with the other running the exhaust valves, allowing for better airflow and performance."
Are DOHC engines reliable?	"The SOHC and DOHC can?t be judged on reliability simply because of the configuration. However, DOHC engines have more moving parts involved, so there?s more that can go wrong. Additionally, trying to repair the DOHC engine can be more complicated and costly than working on a SOHC engine. "
Conclusion	"Most of today?s car engines are either a SOHC or DOHC design. Choosing between the single or dual overhead cam comes down to various aspects you need to consider. While the SOHC engine is more cost-effective and easier to maintain, it?s not going to pump out the same level of power as the DOHC engine. Efficiency is also a factor to consider, but this falls more on how the automaker creates the engine and what technology is included.Understanding these differences helps you determine which engine is the right option for your next car. If you are looking to save money and you want to work on the engine yourself, you might do better choosing something with a SOHC motor. On the other hand, for maximum performance and a smooth ride, the DOHC is the motor you would prefer. "
How Much Does It Cost To Swap An Engine?	"The total cost of an engine swap could be between $2,500 and $10,000. However, if you are putting in a high-performance engine or working on a luxury car, the cost could reach as much as $20,000. Prices can go up even more if a new transmission is involved in the swap.To figure out the cost, several factors must be examined. Aside from the cost of the new engine, there?s also the labor charge and additional parts required for the installation.  "
Factors Affecting The Engine Swap Cost ?	"It?s not as simple as figuring out how much a new engine costs. To get the total price for the engine swap, you must put together several factors.Here are a few of the top considerations you must think about. 1. Engine CostSwapped EngineThe largest factor is going to be the charge for the motor itself. New engines can cost between $500 and $15,000, on average. There are multiple types of engines to choose from. If you plan to swap out the engine with a rebuilt motor or one that is repaired, your cost won?t be as high as if you choose to purchase a new motor. In fact, you can find used motors for as low as $500, but there may not be any guarantees with these engines.If you want something new, you may still be able to save by choosing a stock engine. This would be a direct replacement for what the car came with from the factory. Otherwise, if you want a high-performance engine upgrade, your cost is going to be much higher. The benefit of this option is an increase in power and handling. READ MORE: Car Engine Replacement Cost2. Labor CostsCar Engine ReplacementUnless you have a full-service garage, you will probably need to pay for someone to install the engine. Motor swaps require a lot of work with specialized tools and you need a fair amount of expertise.For this reason, you probably need to think about how much the labor might cost. This expense isn?t as easy to estimate. In most cases, you can expect to spend $2,000 or more just because of the complexity of the job. However, labor rates vary greatly based on where you live. The type of vehicle you drive also plays a part in the labor charges. 3. Transmission CostWith your engine swap, you may also require a new transmission. If you are swapping the engine because it has gone bad and you plan to use a direct replacement, a new transmission might not be necessary.On the other hand, if you are upgrading the engine, the old transmission might not be compatible. In this case, you will need to also upgrade the tranny. You can choose transmissions with a vast selection of costs and quality as well. For a cheap, used transmission, you may only spend $250, while a new performance-oriented transmission could cost $2,500 or more. 4. Swap Kit And Additional Parts CostThere are more parts to swap than just the engine. You will have to factor in all of the parts costs with your engine swap. Depending on what?s needed, this aspect could add $100 to $5,000 to your total cost. Among these parts, you can also choose budget-friendly components or high-performance elements.Evaluate whether you need a new exhaust, fuel pump, or gaskets. There will also be necessary hardware and wiring that?s required. If you choose a stock engine, you may be able to use some of the existing parts over again and save some money.5. Vehicle TypeThe final consideration is what type of vehicle you drive. If you have a small, compact vehicle, the engine won?t be as expensive as if you were driving a heavy-duty truck. Additionally, if you have a popular vehicle, such as a Toyota Corolla, it will be a lot easier to get a new engine.If you drive a luxury or sports car, the cost is going to be much higher. Not only will the engine itself cost more, but you may also need a special technician to perform the labor. On top of that, any extra parts required are going to also have a premium price tag. "
What Is An Engine Swap?	"During an engine swap, you take out the old car engine and replace it with a new one. The engine needs to be new to your car but isn?t necessarily a brand-new model. You can perform an engine swap with a used or rebuilt motor too. Engine swaps are done for multiple reasons. If your motor is damaged and isn?t worth repairing, you may prefer to put something new in. You can also upgrade the performance of an engine by putting something more powerful under the hood. This engine swap may also require a new transmission with the upgrade. Some people also prefer to upgrade the engine if towing and hauling are important. If you drive a truck, you may prefer increasing the capability with a better engine. "
Parts Required In An Engine Swap	"Before you begin the engine swap, you want to make sure you have all of the necessary parts. Some of these might seem obvious, but there are several you may not be thinking about. Here are the basics of what?s needed, but more could be added depending on what you hope to accomplish.1. EngineThe first you need for the engine swap is the motor. Engines come in a variety of sizes and styles, so you want to make sure you choose one that?s compatible with your vehicle. If the car currently has a four-cylinder engine, you will probably replace it with something similar. If you prefer to upgrade, you will need to make other modifications to the vehicle.With your engine swap, you also have a couple of considerations to keep in mind. You can swap it out with a used or rebuilt motor. Otherwise, you might prefer a brand-new engine, which is especially helpful if you are looking to upgrade performance. READ MORE: Engine Rebuild Cost2. TransmissionTo swap out the engine with one exactly like it, there would be no reason to put a new transmission in. As long as the transmission is still in good working condition, you can expect the new motor to be compatible. Otherwise, if you plan to upgrade the engine for performance, you may need to put a new tranny in as well. Check to see what?s needed before you get started because a new transmission can drastically affect your total cost. 3. WiringsThe engine connects to the essential parts of the car through a system of wiring. When you perform an engine swap, you want to inspect all of the existing wires.Some of them may be reusable, but others will need to be replaced. If you notice any frayed or worn wiring, it?s best to replace it during the swap. 4. Swap KitInstead of purchasing all of the individual components needed to provide the swap, you can buy a kit to make it easier. A typical engine swap kit may contain the headers, oil pan and motor mounts.Depending on what kit you choose, some will also include the transmission cross members. As with a new engine, you can choose swap kits of varying quality. 5. Software ProgrammingThe cost for the swap won?t just involve different parts but also some tools to get the engine programmed. For the engine to work with the various sensors and computers, programming has to take place.The trouble with this programming is that not everyone can perform it at home. In many cases, an engine shop or dealership will be needed to help with the programming. "
Can I Swap a Gas Engine with a Diesel? 	"You can essentially put any engine into a car that you want, it?s just a matter of how much time and money you have. To swap a gas engine with a diesel, a lot of modifications need to take place. Expect to spend a good chunk of change once all is said and done. "
Is Swapping An Engine Worth It?	"If the engine no longer functions and your car has a decent resale value, it makes sense to swap the motor out. Additionally, if you need more performance from your car, you may find the cost is justifiable. On the other hand, if your car is old and will probably have more mechanical failures, it might not be worth putting another engine in. You might prefer to junk the car instead. "
Is It Cheaper To Engine Swap Or Rebuild?	"Most often, the rebuild is going to cost a lot less than a swap, maybe saving you half of the cost or more. However, not all engines make a good candidate for a rebuild. If the block or structure of the engine is compromised, you won?t want to use it for a rebuild. "
How Long Does An Engine Swap Take?	"If the swap requires you to take out the old engine and bolt in the same one, you may be able to get the job done in about ten hours. If any other modifications need to be performed or if other parts are required, the engine swap is going to take longer than normal. "
Is Swapping Engines Easy?	"Even with the same engine, it?s not easy to put a new motor in place. You have to carefully unbolt the old engine and replace it with a new one, making sure everything gets reconnected. If you are looking to put in a different engine, the difficulty is going to go up significantly. "
Conclusion	"To estimate the engine swap cost, you want to look at the complete picture. Don?t just evaluate what the new engine will cost you, but look closely at the total repair job, so you can ensure you have enough money set aside. We advise you to shop around for the parts and labor rates. Even with a few hours of working out all of the details ahead of time, you may be able to save yourself a good amount of money. It could be well worth your time to shop around. "
what are the Causes of Car Cranks But Won?t Start ?	"The most common reasons why a car cranks but won?t start have to do with a lack of fuel, compression or ignition. However, battery problems can also come into play. Here are five of the most common complaints. 1. Lack Of FuelFuel Injector SprayFor the engine to get started, fuel must enter the combustion chamber. The fuel will mix with the air for proper combustion. If something is preventing fuel from getting to the engine, you may hear it try to crank, but it won?t start. A bad fuel pump is one of the most common things that could prevent gas from getting to the engine. When the pump fails, gas can no longer be pumped through the system. On the other hand, the problem could be something as simple as a clogged fuel filter. Another reason for a lack of fuel is clogged injectors. These nozzles get clogged with debris, corrosion and rust. Additionally, bad fuel can cause problems with the injectors, which is why it?s important to get gas from top-tier stations. Some people try to prevent fuel injector clogs by using regular additives. 2. Ignition ProblemsSpark From Spark PlugIf there?s no issue with the fuel system, the ignition could be the culprit. Most often, the spark plugs are fouled or contaminated. Because the plugs need to ignite the fuel/air mixture, there wouldn?t be enough spark to get things going. Some plugs are only good for about 30,000 miles, while others have a rating of 100,000 miles or more. If you have an older car, the wires could also be the problem. Otherwise, newer models use ignition coils to supply power to the plugs, which could also be the reason. 3. Low CompressionThe engine also requires the right amount of compression, along with air, fuel and spark. If there?s not enough compression, you?ll have a lot of trouble getting the engine to start. Low compression can be caused by gaskets or seals that are leaking. You might need to replace the valves or piston rings to get everything running again. 4. Bad Ignition TimingWe?ve already discussed how important a spark is to get the engine running, but the spark must also be perfectly timed. If it happens too early or too late, the fuel/air mixture won?t combust correctly. One of the main reasons for incorrect firing is a defective crankshaft position sensor. This sensor tells the computer what position the pistons and valves are in, so the spark can be timed perfectly. If the sensor fails, the computer won?t know when to fire the spark plugs, causing trouble starting the engine. Ignition timing also has a lot to do with the timing chain. Most chains are rated for the life of the car, but that doesn?t mean they won?t fail over time. 5. Battery Power IssuesThere?s no question that a dead battery will lead to an engine that won?t start, but it doesn?t always allow for the motor to crank over. Still, you can?t overlook the possibility that the battery is just starting to discharge. In this case, there might be enough power to crank it but not get it started.Even if the battery is in good condition, corroded or damaged cables can cause the same issue. A quick inspection should help you determine if the terminals or cables need to be dealt with. "
How To Fix A Car That Cranks But Won?t Start ?	"You want to figure out why the car isn?t starting so you aren?t stranded. For most people, the diagnostics aren?t too difficult, especially with some minor mechanical expertise. Here are a few steps you can take with some basic tools and knowledge. However, if you feel that any of these tasks are over your head, it?s okay to reach out to a professional too. After paying for a diagnostic charge, you can always decide later if you want to repair the problem yourself. 1. Read Trouble CodesScan Trouble CodesSome of these faults will cause a code to be set in the computer. If you have a warning light on the dashboard, it?s possible you can figure out what?s wrong with the help of your code scanner.Plug in your compatible OBD-II scanner to the port under the steering wheel. Read the codes and research them online to see what the problem is. At MechanicBase, we have a free list of the most popular trouble codes.If you don?t have a code scanner, you can still see what has been set in the computer. Drive to your nearest auto parts store and have them scan the system for free. 2. Charge The BatteryIf there are no codes present or none have to do with a cranking problem, you want to move on to the battery. Begin with a quick inspection of the connections. They should all be secure and there should be no corrosion present. If you see corrosion, clean it off with a baking soda and water mixture.The next step would be to check the battery voltage. Here are a few tips.Turn off the car and all accessories.Set a multimeter to 20V DC.Connect the multimeter red lead to the positive battery terminal.Connect the multimeter black lead to the negative battery terminal.If the measurement is lower than 12.4 volts, you should charge the battery. You can also perform a cranking test to check on the battery. Here are some general steps.Turn off the vehicle and accessories.Disable the ignition system so the vehicle will only crank but not start.Connect the multimeter the same way you did above.Get a helper to turn the ignition on for 15 seconds while you watch the multimeter. If the voltage of the battery goes below 9.6 volts, your battery is weak. Connect your battery to a charger to see if you can get it going again. If the battery can?t be charged, it?s time to replace it. 3. Check SparkYou can check for spark with a spark plug tester. The directions aren?t complicated. In general, here are some steps you can follow. Take off the engine cover. Find the spark plugs. Most four-cylinder engines have the spark plugs on top of the motor. The same is true with an inline-six. If you have a V6 or V8 engine, the cylinders will be on both sides of the engine.Unplug the fuel injectors so the engine doesn?t get flooded with fuel during the process.Remove the ignition coil from the plug you hope to test. It can remain connected to the wiring harness.Connect your inline spark plug tester between the plug and the ignition coil. Do not touch the spark tester or ignition coil while testing.Get a helper to turn the ignition on and try to crank the engine. When the engine is trying to turn over, look for the indicator on the test light. If it responds, there is a spark. Aside from the spark plugs, there could also be defects with other parts. It?s not unusual for the ignition coils to go bad, either. 4. Check Fuel PressureTo check for fuel system issues, you want a pressure gauge. If the pressure is low, you will further have to diagnose which part is to blame. Additionally, some advanced code scanners also offer the ability to look at fuel pressure. You can analyze the pressure and see where there might be a fault. Some pressure faults are simple enough to fix at home, while others may require the help of a professional. 5. Check CompressionTo check engine compression, you are looking at more advanced tactics and equipment. Most home mechanics won?t have the necessary tools to get an accurate view of the compression.For this reason, you might prefer at this point to visit your local auto repair shop. By ruling out problems with the other systems first, you can almost guarantee that compression is the problem. "
How Do You Fix A Car That Cranks But Won?t Start?	"First, you must diagnose what?s wrong with it. Once you find out whether the battery, ignition system, fuel system or low compression is to blame, you have a better idea about what parts need to be replaced. "
Can Bad Spark Plugs Cause Crank But No Start?	"Yes, spark plugs are needed to ignite the fuel/air mixture in the combustion chamber. If the spark plugs are old, contaminated or fouled, they won?t be able to ignite this mixture properly. While the problem often starts with performance issues, it is possible that the engine won?t start if the plugs are defective enough. "
Can A Bad Battery Cause Crank But No Start?	"If the battery is low, it may try to crank, but not for long. A dead car battery will only lead to a no-start situation. There won?t be enough power to create the cranking that you are used to hearing. "
Can A Blown Fuse Prevent Car From Starting?	"There are some blown fuses that can keep the car from starting. Depending on what fuse is blown, the engine may try to crank but not start. Otherwise, you may not get any cranking either but simply have a no-start situation. "
Conclusion	"If the car cranks but won?t start, don?t automatically chalk it up to a dead battery. Instead, you need to look at several major systems to determine what?s going on, including the ignition, fuel and compression.Many of these problems will exhibit other issues before the car won?t start. If you can catch the issue when it first starts, you may be able to avoid a no-start situation. An OBD scanner will save you a lot of headaches, money, and time.Once the engine won?t start, you need to take immediate action. Hopefully, you are in a place where you can work on the car and resolve the issue. Otherwise, you might need to have it towed first."
what is the Denso Spark Plugs ?	"Denso is one of the top producers of spark plugs in the world. It has become one of the most trusted names in automotive parts, so it?s obvious that the plugs are going to live up to your expectations. The Denso Corporation is Japanese-based. The company has been in business since 1949, now running more than two hundred subsidiaries around the world. While you might know the company mostly because of its spark plug production, it?s also known for making high-quality oxygen sensors and fuel injectors. "
what is the NGK Spark Plugs ?	"Another top provider of spark plugs is NGK. In fact, this company provides a lot of the original equipment (OE) for many automakers, so it?s possible you are driving a car with NGK plugs in it straight from the factory. Some companies that regularly use NGK plugs include Subaru, Toyota, Honda and Mitsubishi. The NGK Spark Plug Company Ltd is also based in Japan and has been around since 1936. Additionally, it is a public company. While the company is known for producing high-performance spark plugs, there are also other automotive parts coming off of the assembly line, mostly related to the engine. However, the company also produces ceramics and sensors for non-automotive industries.  "
differences between Denso and  NGK Spark Plugs: Which Is Better?	"Denso is known for making long-lasting and durable spark plugs. However, NGK seems to offer better performance with its lineup of plugs. The costs aren?t that different from one another, so you can?t go wrong with either option. Here is more detailed information on the differences between Denso vs. NGK spark plugs:1. MaterialNgk Spark PlugIn general, spark plugs can be made from a variety of materials. The lowest line of spark plugs usually contains copper, which doesn?t last as long. Beyond that, you also have the choice between platinum and iridium spark plugs, both of which include a better, more durable construction. With Denso and NGK, the companies offer all of these materials to choose from. If you prefer a low-cost spark plug, you can choose a copper replacement or upgrade to one of the best iridium plugs on the market. In fact, when you compare the plugs side-by-side, make sure you are choosing two models made from the same materials or else your comparison will be skewed. RELATED: 4 Types of Spark Plugs (Copper vs Iridium vs Platinum vs Double Platinum)2. TechnologySpark Plug TechnologyDenso spark plugs have some unique designs that help to set them apart. For starters, the Denso plugs have 360-degree laser-welded construction with the iridium materials. With this design, you can expect a long-lasting plug that is meant to be durable and strong. It also comes with low voltage requirements that provide high ignitability, so you are never at a loss for power. If that?s not enough, Denso spark plugs also have a twin-tip design on some plugs. This construction allows titanium and platinum to work together for a solid spark. The electrode center craftsmanship further takes the sturdiness to new heights. That isn?t to say there?s anything wrong with the NGK spark plugs. To the contrary, this company is also way ahead of the competition. With the trivalent plating design, the spark plug becomes more resistant to chemicals, corrosion and moisture. Additionally, the NGK lineup seems to be more geared toward performance, which is why the brand is often used when limits need to be pushed. 3. LifespanWhen looking at spark plugs, most fall within the same range as one another based on what material is used. For this reason, you can expect copper spark plugs to last for 20,000 to 40,000 miles, while platinum plugs might go 40,000 to 80,000 miles. There are some double platinum and iridium plugs that are rated for 100,000 miles or more.With that said, both Denso and NGK plugs seem to fall within these guidelines as well. However, the NGK plugs may wear out just slightly sooner because the focus is on performance. Whenever you are dealing with performance parts, you can expect them to wear down a little sooner. Is it enough to make a significant difference? Probably not.4. CostThe cost between the two brands is comparable. Some enthusiasts find that the Denso spark plugs can be slightly more expensive but not at a rate that?s going to make a big difference.If you compare apples to apples, you are probably getting a similar per-mile price since the NGK plugs may not last as long. Basically, you are left with deciding whether you want to pay more now, so you can change the plugs less often or you are willing to change them sooner for a lower price now. "
Denso Spark Plugs: Pros and Cons	"You shouldn?t have any trouble finding Denso spark plugs for your vehicle. The company doesn?t just offer a full range of plugs for most passenger vehicles, but they can also be found in a variety of materials. Additionally, the unique design ensures that they last longer than some other brands on the market. With that said, Denso plugs can often carry a slightly higher price upfront than other brands. While you are paying more now for the plugs, it?s not significantly higher. Plus, if the plugs last longer than a comparable brand, you are getting a better value in the long run. "
NGK Spark Plugs: Pros and Cons	"The biggest advantage that NGK has going for it is the performance offered with the spark plug lineup. These plugs are designed to improve performance, which may also equate to some fuel savings. For this reason, many automakers choose to use this brand of spark plug when manufacturing new cars. Additionally, the NGK lineup is just as diverse as what?s available with Denso. You can find many different size plugs for a variety of cars, plus you have the option to choose the material you want. For this reason, you must be careful when deciding which plugs you want, as some won?t perform as well as others simply because of the construction. The only major problem with NGK is something that could happen with any brand. The company chooses to pre-gap the majority of the spark plugs. However, once they arrive at the store or you have them shipped to you, the gap could be wrong. Still, we always recommend that you use a gauge gap tool before you install any new plugs. Measurements should always be double-checked to ensure superior performance. "
Reasons to Change Spark Plugs ?	"1. Better PerformanceSpark plugs affect performance in multiple ways. Considering that the spark plugs are needed to combust the air and fuel mixture in the engine, you want to ensure that they are in optimal condition, designed to protect the engine. Additionally, good spark plugs are going to improve the start-up time of your vehicle. Worn plugs can lead to a rough idle, trouble accelerating and overall performance issues. If you purchase a set of plugs specifically designed for performance, you may also see some added horsepower as a bonus. 2. Better Fuel EconomyWhen the engine is running as it should, you know that you are getting the best fuel economy possible. The opposite is also true. If the plugs are worn and the engine can?t perform normally, you are going to spend money on fuel. Consider how much money can be saved by using a high-quality set of plugs. You might save enough to justify the additional cost from copper to iridium plugs. 3. Reduced EmissionsThe emissions coming from your vehicle are directly related to how the engine runs. When the engine runs effectively, you can count on less pollution being pumped into the environment. To further improve the emissions coming from your vehicle, you want to perform all of the recommended maintenance. Spark plugs are only one part of the complete picture. "
"Which is a Better Spark Plug, Denso or NGK?"	"It?s difficult to compare the two brands because both are high-quality. Denso plugs might have a slightly longer lifespan than NGK, but not by much. On the other hand, the upfront cost of Denso tends to be a little bit higher, but it all washes out in the end. "
What Brand of Spark Plug is Best?	"Both Denso and NGK are high-quality spark plug brands. You won?t go wrong with either option. Still, there are some other brands you might be interested in checking out. Enthusiasts also praise the performance of E3, Champion, Bosch, ACDelco and Autolite too. "
What Spark Plugs Last the Longest?	"Copper is the lowest-end spark plug you can buy with the shortest lifespan. Platinum is considered a harder metal, so it?s going to last longer. Double platinum and iridium spark plugs tend to last the longest, with some rated for 100,000 miles or more. "
Do Expensive Spark Plugs Make a Difference?	"Iridium spark plugs are going to be the most expensive, no matter which brand you choose. However, these last the longest and are more durable. If you don?t want to change the plugs often and you want the best performance, it?s always recommended to go with the double platinum or iridium plugs, even though they cost more. "
Do I Really Need Iridium Spark Plugs?	"There?s nothing forcing you to buy iridium spark plugs, but you may want to invest in the better options. They are going to last longer and provide better performance than most copper and platinum options. They won?t deteriorate as fast as the copper material ones, meaning you have to change the plugs less often. "
"Can Spark Plugs Last 200,000 Miles?"	"Even the best spark plugs are only rated for around 100,000 miles. This would be about the longest you would want to go without changing the spark plugs. It?s important to follow all recommended maintenance procedures for your car if you want the engine to last, which also includes spark plug replacement."
Conclusion	"If you want your car to run its best, you should keep up with the regular maintenance schedule. On this schedule, you see the importance of changing the spark plugs, but what you might not know is how vital it is to choose the best replacement.Two top brands offer plenty of durability and performance for your vehicle, but it can be hard to choose between Denso vs. NGK. After our review, you should have a better understanding of which option might be better for your driving needs."
what are the Causes Serpentine Belt Noise ?	"Squealing serpentine belt noise can be caused by a worn-out belt, a bad tensioner, or a stuck pulley or bad idler pulley. It can also be caused by something less mechanical, such as exposure to coolant or simply from the cold weather. 1. Worn Out BeltCracked Serpentine BeltSerpentine belts aren?t meant to last forever. Because of the synthetic rubber construction, you can expect a life between 50,000 and 100,000 miles in most vehicles. As the belt starts to wear out, the ribs cause it to move rougher across the pulleys. As the belt drags slightly, a variety of noises can occur, including squealing. The noise may become louder as the belt fails completely until it finally breaks. 2. Bad TensionerSymptoms Of A Bad Tensioner PulleyThe serpentine belt must be regulated by the drive belt tensioner. It?s a unique pulley that?s connected with an adjustable pivoting function to guide the belt. When the tensioner fails, it can no longer hold the belt as tight as it should. With the belt becoming loose, strange noises are sure to follow. You may notice them becoming worse as you step on the gas pedal. Additionally, when the belt becomes too loose it can come off and cause damage. 3. Faulty or Stuck PulleyTensioner PulleyAround the belt system are various pulleys that help spin the accessories like the power steering, alternator and AC compressor. These pulleys contain spinning grooves to keep the belt moving smoothly.If one of the pulleys wears or the accessories get stuck and turn with a lot of resistance, the belt will slip on the pulley. You may hear a squeaking or chirping sound. In addition, this can lead to even more damage to the serpentine belt and slipping. For this reason, you do not want to postpone the correction.4. Misaligned Idler PulleyIdler PulleyAlong with the other pulleys we?ve discussed, there?s also an idler pulley that plays a role in the system. This idler pulley is also responsible for keeping the belt moving in the right track. If it becomes damaged or misaligned, the belt won?t move properly. It can start to slip and cause additional wear to the belt, along with the squealing noises you hear. 5. Coolant ExposureMechanical failure isn?t your only problem. If you get coolant or antifreeze on the belt, you could also notice some squealing sounds. Even a small amount can cause a lot of problems, which is why you need to be cautious during maintenance.Additionally, antifreeze can drip onto the belt if there?s a leak in the hoses. Either way, the coolant is going to damage the belt and lead to squealing. You will probably need to replace the belt. 6. Cold WeatherWhen temperatures drop, many aspects of the car are affected, including the serpentine belt. If you only hear the squealing when the temperatures are low, you may not have to do anything to fix it yet. Once the engine warms up, the belt should stop squealing. Still, it?s best to have it looked at, just to be sure. In fact, the cold weather can lead to faster damage as the material of the belt becomes more brittle. "
How to Diagnose Serpentine Belt Noise ?	"1. Listen/Pay Attention The first thing you should do is pay attention to what?s happening. If the squealing only occurs when the car is cold and stops as soon as it warms up, you may not have a big problem.That?s why it?s important to take note of when the sound is occurring. You also want to listen closely to where the sound is coming from. 2. Examine BeltInspect Serpentine BeltWhen you are ready to diagnose the problem, the first place to start is with the belt itself. Most of the time, the belt needs to be changed because it is old and brittle. After all, this belt endures a lot of friction and constant motion.If you see any cracks on the belt, it?s getting close to snapping and you should take immediate action. Even if the wear is only minimal, you are better off replacing it sooner than later, before bigger problems occur. 3. Look for CoolantIf you recently added coolant to your system and might have dripped some on the belt, this could be causing your problem. Additionally, if there are any leaks in the system, the belt might be contaminated. Sadly, you can?t easily clean off the coolant from the belt. It?s going to absorb into the belt and lead to permanent damage. Your only way to get rid of the squealing is to replace the belt. 4. Tighten PulleysIf the belt is loose, it?s going to squeal. Once you?ve performed an inspection, you want to move onto the pulleys if there?s nothing physically wrong with the belt. As the belt spins, there should be no slack. If there is, you need to tighten up the pulleys. This job isn?t generally difficult and normally doesn?t require taking off the belt to complete. However, if the pulley needs to be replaced you will need to remove the belt. Modern pulleys are usually automatic, and if the tension is bad, you may have to replace the pulley tensioner.5. Visit MechanicIf the above steps haven?t revealed the problem, you are going to need some more support. You may not want to reach out to a mechanic, but it?s necessary if you have hit a dead end.Research some local auto repair shops to see who does a good job in your area. Most likely, you shouldn?t have to pay more than an hour or so of labor to figure out what?s wrong. "
How to Fix Serpentine Belt Noise ?	"1. Get Diagram of Serpentine BeltThere?s a reason that the serpentine belt has the name it does. It generally snakes around several accessories and pulleys in a strange format. The path this belt weaves is unique to your vehicle and you must know how it goes before you take it off.You can take a picture of how the belt is installed. There could also be a diagram under the hood of the car. If you can?t find it anywhere else, you want to get a copy of the service manual. Putting the belt on the wrong way will lead to disaster. 2. Release TensionerBefore you take off the belt, you must release the tensioner. The tensioner is going to hold the belt tight, so you don?t want to take it off until the pressure is released. Most designs use one of two ways to release them.It could have a «-inch square cast to the tensioner arm, requiring a belt tensioner tool or breaker bar. With other designs, you may be able to use a socket with the pulley to remove the tension. 3. Remove BeltDrive Belt RemovedOnce the tension has been removed, you are ready to take the belt off. Use caution with this step because you don?t want to cause damage to any of the pulleys or other equipment on the route. Once the belt is off, you will be able to inspect it better. If misalignment led to the wear, you want to fix this now before you put the belt on, as a new belt isn?t going to fix the problem. 4. Inspect/Fix PulleysWith a straightedge, you can align the pulleys. It?s also important to clean off the pulleys so there?s no grime sticking around. Take the time to spin all of the pulleys, including the idler pulley and tensioner pulleys. They should spin without any obstruction and there should be no noise. You also want to turn the pulleys to the power steering, alternator and AC compressor to ensure they spin freely. You also don?t want to see any play side to side. If you notice problems, replace the pulleys while the belt is already off. 5. Install New BeltWith your new serpentine belt in hand, you are ready to put it back in position. Snake it through according to the diagram you set aside earlier. Once it is in position, you want to release the tensioner to make it tight. Double-check that the belt is centered across the pulleys and isn?t slipping off anywhere. Once you have inspected your work, you are ready to start the car.6. Test DriveStart the car engine and allow it to idle for a minute. You can watch the serpentine belt to see that it?s rotating correctly, but do not put your hand in its way while it?s moving. Once you think everything looks good, take the car for a drive. Listen to ensure that all of the squealing noises are gone. "
what is the Cost to Replace Serpentine Belt ?	"On average, you may spend around $50 to get a new serpentine belt. If you can replace this belt yourself, there?s no additional cost for labor. If you need to hire a professional, you might spend another $50 to $150 to have it installed. The labor cost depends on the make and model of your vehicle. Some vehicles are much harder to install a belt on than others. "
What Does a Failing Serpentine Belt Sound Like?	"The belt will typically squeal, but it?s also known to make a clunking, chirping and squeaking sound. The noises often imitate what you would expect with a bad accessory bearing, which is why many people have trouble diagnosing the problem. "
Can I Drive With a Squealing Serpentine Belt?	"No, it?s recommended to change the serpentine belt at the first sign of failure. This belt is responsible for driving many vital components, including the power steering, air conditioning and the alternator. If it fails, it can lead to serious damage and these components will stop working. "
Is a Serpentine Belt Expensive to Fix?	"With most vehicles, replacing the serpentine belt is an inexpensive fix. You may only spend around $50 for the parts and another $50 to $150 for the labor. Some vehicles make it much more complicated to install a serpentine belt, so you could spend more on labor. "
What Happens if the Serpentine Belt Breaks While Driving?	"The serpentine belt runs many vital components. If the belt breaks, you could lose power to the steering system, the air conditioning could go out and the alternator could stop working. Additionally, if it runs the water pump, it could stop the flow of coolant, causing an overheating engine. "
How Long Will a Squeaking Serpentine Belt Last?	"Depending on what rubber material the serpentine belt is made from, it could last 50,000 to 100,000 miles if it?s in good shape. If it?s squealing, it will drastically shorten its lifespan. Friction and heat are detrimental to the belt, causing it to wear down over time, even with regular maintenance. Once it starts squeaking, it should be inspected right away."
Conclusion	"There are a few things that can cause your serpentine belt to squeal, and all of them should be fixed as soon as possible. Don?t ignore the problem, as it will only get worse and may eventually lead to more expensive repairs.Follow our guide to ensure your car continues running as it should and you can rid yourself of that dreaded noise once and for all. If you are not sure how to fix the problem yourself, take it to a professional mechanic, and they will be able to diagnose and fix the problem easily."
Does a Cold Air Intake Increase MPG?	"Yes, a cold air intake can improve the fuel economy in many vehicles. Cold air intakes create better combustion of the air-fuel mixture, so less gas is consumed. With more oxygen being pumped into the combustion chamber, the process becomes more efficient overall, helping you save money. The high-flow filter also helps to optimize the mixture in the engine. Therefore, adding a better filter can also improve the fuel economy and engine performance. With that said, adding a cold air intake might not produce major results that are tangible, so don?t expect crazy results just with a cold air intake. Depending on what model you choose and the car you drive, you may have a hard time tracking the added savings. "
How Much Fuel Can Be Saved With a Cold Air Intake?	"The results you see from upgrading to a cold air intake can vary greatly, depending on the car model. If everything goes as expected, you may be able to increase the fuel economy by up to 1 to 3 miles per gallon. However, this is only possible if the new intake produces cooler air than what?s available with the stock setup. In some cases, you could even harm the fuel efficiency if you swap out a system that?s already efficient. You could also notice a drop in performance when this happens. For this reason, it?s important to do your research ahead before making any upgrades. "
What Does a Cold Air Intake Do?	"The cold air intake pumps colder air into the combustion chamber and engine than what?s found in the stock configuration. Inside the combustion chamber, the air and fuel mixture is ignited so power can be transferred to the cylinders that create physical energy to provide momentum through the transmission. With cooler air, the oxygen becomes denser. Even with the same volume as hot or warm air, the colder air is going to contain more oxygen in a relative amount of space. The resulting combustion becomes more efficient, which turns into better performance and improved fuel economy. The cold air intake replaces a standard air box. The plastic or metal tube connects to a conical air filter in combination with a heat shield that protects the filter from the hot components surrounding it. Because of this design, the air going into the engine is going to be much cooler, even if everything around it is hot. "
what is the Cold Air Intake Benefits ?	"1. More PowerWith a high-performance cold air intake, you can count on more power coming from the engine. As the air and fuel combust more efficiently, horsepower will be added.Because of this boost, you can also expect better acceleration. The cold air density is higher than what was previously flowing through, so there?s more air available to the engine when it?s needed the most. RELATED: How Much Horsepower Does a Cold Air Intake Add?2. Improved Fuel EfficiencyWith the improvements made to the way the engine runs, you may also see better fuel economy. As the air to fuel ratio improves, you will need less fuel to get the same results. The less fuel that?s needed to burn, the more you save every time you go to the pump. However, the results may not be as dramatic as you might have hoped, depending on the intake you replaced. 3. Upgraded FiltersOpen Air FilterMost performance cold air intakes will also include a tough, more durable filter. These are better than the standard paper filters you might have been using with your engine.Additionally, you won?t need to change these filters like you would with a generic type. Instead, you take the filters off periodically and clean them out to be reused. RELATED: How Often Should You Change the Engine Air Filter?4. More Aggressive SoundIf you are hoping to make your car more noticeable, the cold air intake might help you achieve your dreams. With the right intake, there may be a fuller and louder sound through the engine.As the motor receives more cool air, the sound will increase. Of course, it won?t be as noticeable as putting on a performance exhaust, but it?s something worth noting. "
what is the Cold Air Intake Drawbacks ?	"1. PriceyAs with any upgrade made to your car, you need to be willing to pay. Sure, you can choose a lower-cost option, but it probably won?t produce the results you are hoping for.Instead, you will want to purchase a high-performance cold air intake from a reputable brand. On average, you can expect to spend $200 or more just for the parts. 2. Difficult to InstallSome upgrades are simple to perform. While adding a cold air intake isn?t overly complicated, it isn?t easy if you are skilled in the task. Additionally, you may need tools that you don?t have on hand. For this reason, you might need to factor in a professional installation to your costs, which are already on the higher side. 3. Debris CollectionEverything that the cold air intake does well can also create some headaches. Because the cold air intake is efficient at sucking in more air to the engine, you can also expect a larger amount of moisture and debris to hit the filter. If this debris gets to the engine because you don?t clean the filter, it can lead to big problems. Additionally, allowing the filter to clog can cause performance problems. "
what is the Cold Air Intake Installation ?	"A cold air intake is an aftermarket modification that is installed in a vehicle's engine to increase the amount of cool air flowing into the engine's combustion chamber. The installation of a cold air intake involves the removal of the vehicle's stock air intake system and replacing it with a larger diameter pipe, a high-flow air filter, and an air box that is designed to allow the maximum amount of air to flow through it.The process of installing a cold air intake typically involves the following steps:Disconnect the negative battery terminal to prevent any accidental electrical shorts.Remove the factory air intake system, including the air box, the air filter, and the intake ducting.Install the new cold air intake system, including the larger diameter pipe, high-flow air filter, and air box.Reconnect the electrical connections and any hoses that were disconnected during the removal of the stock air intake system.Double-check all connections and hoses to ensure that they are properly secured.Reconnect the negative battery terminal and start the engine to check for any leaks or abnormal sounds.It's important to note that the installation of a cold air intake may void the vehicle's warranty and can also impact emissions regulations in some areas. Additionally, the installation of a cold air intake may not be legal in some states or regions. It's best to consult with a professional mechanic or check local regulations before installing a cold air intake."
How Much Gas Mileage Does a Cold Air Intake Add?	"Colder air is denser than warm air, ensuring more oxygen gets into the engine. With the fuel burning more efficiently, you could gain another 1 to 3 miles per gallon in the best circumstances. Combining this effort with other upgrades will increase your performance and fuel economy further."
Are Cold Air Intakes Worth It?	"If you are buying a cold air intake just to improve fuel efficiency, you will probably be disappointed. However, it?s a good investment if you are hoping to boost how the engine runs or if you want to use it in conjunction with other upgraded aftermarket parts. "
How Can I Improve My Gas Mileage By 70 Percent?	"A cold air intake will not produce those results alone. You also won?t achieve that level of efficiency, no matter what you add. However, you can improve fuel economy by slowing down, avoiding braking and acceleration frequently and ensuring that your tires are properly inflated. It?s also important to keep the car engine tuned up. "
Should I Tune My Car After Installing a Cold Air Intake?	"Whenever you modify how the air or fuel flows through the engine, it?s wise to tune the vehicle. A custom tune ensures that all changes are compensated for. However, a cheap air intake might not make enough of a difference to warrant a tune, so you must use discretion. "
Will a Cold Air Intake Harm My Engine?	"The cold air intake is going to improve engine performance and fuel economy in most cases because it helps the motor run more efficiently. However, the filter can get clogged easier, which would have an adverse effect. To prevent this, it?s important to remove the filter often and clean it. Also if you install a cheap cold air intake kit, it can damage the engine."
Conclusion	"If you are interested in improving the fuel economy of your vehicle, you may have considered the cold air intake. This aftermarket upgrade can provide a lot of benefits, such as improved performance and a more aggressive sound. Yet, the cold air intake isn?t a good option for all drivers.You need to weigh the pros and cons carefully to decide if this is a route that you want to take. Ideally, you will make multiple changes to ensure that the engine runs as efficiently as possible."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad PCV Valve ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad PCV valve are a rough idle and engine performance issues, along with a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice that your engine has high oil consumption and see blue smoke coming from the exhaust.Here is a more detailed list of the bad PCV valve symptoms:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3DZlftr8kE1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightOne of the most common and most noticeable bad PCV valve symptoms is probably the check engine light on your dashboard. When the engine light shows up, there is a trouble code stored in the engine control module.To read the trouble code from the engine control unit, you have to use an OBD2 scanner. Some older cars with a PCV valve fitted without an electronically controlled engine will not have this symptom.2. High Idle RPM/Rough IdleCar Engine Rough Idle E1609793094987Because the PCV valve controls the airflow between the crankcase and the intake manifold, a broken PCV valve can have the same symptoms as an intake air leak, which can cause the idle RPM to get too high and other strange idle behaviors like a very rough idle.If you have any strange idle problems, it?s always a good idea to check the PCV valve first.3. Lean/Rich MixtureCar Rich Mixture E1609804774815Because of the issues discussed, a faulty PCV valve can have the same symptoms as an intake leak, and the air/fuel mixture can end up being wrong. Usually, your air/fuel mixture will become lean, and you can feel the same symptoms as from a lean mixture.With a rich mixture, you can often see that the car has a little more gray/white smoke than usual, and you can often detect the smell of petrol.Lean mixture is more difficult to find, but it often causes misfires, as we will discuss next.4. MisfiresCar Misfires E1609774947173Because you can get a faulty lean/rich mixture due to a faulty PCV valve, you might feel misfires while idling or accelerating when your PCV valve is bad.If you have a too lean mixture, the cylinders won?t fire up correctly, which can cause misfires. If you have a mixture that is too rich, you can turn off the spark with the fuel and therefore cause a misfire.5. Rough AccelerationSlow AccelerationWhen you have a faulty PCV valve causing a wrong fuel mixture, you can feel that your car has rough acceleration on high and low RPMs.On most cars, you won?t feel a broken PCV valve on higher RPMs than idle, but it?s worth mentioning because it can happen depending on the valve?s design.6. Increased Oil Consumption & Oil leaksCar Oil Leak E1609805239727If the PCV valve or the hoses are blocked by moisture, you will get a very high pressure inside the engine crankcase, which will push the pressure up in the cylinders and out from the gaskets.If you suddenly see several large oil leaks and increased oil consumption in your car, check the PCV valve and the hoses to it to make sure they?re not blocked.7. White/Black/Blue Smoke from the ExhaustBlack Smoke CarIf the PCV valve or the hoses are blocked, the crankcase will push oil up into the combustion chambers, which will cause oil to burn inside the engine and go out through the exhaust pipe.This will cause a lot of blue smoke from the exhaust pipe. If the PCV valve is faulty and causing a rich or lean mixture to the engine, you can get symptoms like white or black smoke coming out from the exhaust pipe, depending on what type of mixture problem the engine has.A short conclusion is: If you see any strange smoke from the exhaust pipe, make sure that the PCV valve is in good shape."
What is a PCV Valve?	"PCV valve stands for Positive Crankcase Ventilation, and it is one of the oldest and most used emission devices in many vehicles. The PCV valve?s function is to eliminate crankcase emissions from the crankcase and send them to the intake. The emissions are combusted again in another engine cycle, making the engine?s emissions cleaner and more efficient.Most PCV valves are made the same way; two hosing connectors with a spring-loaded one-way valve inside. When the engine is idle, you have a lot of vacuum inside the intake manifold, which helps the emissions get sucked out from the crankcase efficiently at lower speeds.When you are revving up your engine and driving on higher RPMs, the PCV valve will open further and suck out even more crankcase ventilation caused by higher RPM and faster crankcase pressure build-up.Idle/Low RPM: High Vacuum, PCV Valve Half ClosedHigher RPMs: Lower Vacuum, PCV Valve Open FullyBackfire from crankcase: PCV Valve ClosingIf you have a turbocharged engine, you do not want to boost pressure to go into the crankcase, which would cause oil leaks and blow gaskets. Here, it?s crucial to have a one-way PCV valve.These valves are designed differently, and the PCV valve only works on idle and low RPMs. Some PCV valves also have three connectors for a vacuum, which controls them with electric vacuum solenoids. These can work in a lot of ways, and we will discuss them in another article."
Common Trouble Codes Associated with the PCV Valve ?	"Some common trouble codes appear with a faulty PCV valve. If you experience any of these trouble codes from your engine control unit, it?s probably time to check the PCV valve.Remember that just because you see these trouble codes, that doesn?t necessarily mean that the PCV valve is broken. These codes can also be other things, and I always recommend you carry out proper troubleshooting before replacing any parts.P052E ? Positive Crankcase Ventilation Regulator Valve PerformanceP0171 ? Fuel System Too Lean (Bank 1)P0300 ? Random/Multiple Cylinder Misfire DetectedP053A Positive Crankcase Ventilation Heater Control Circuit /Open"
Where is the PCV Valve Located?	"The PCV Valve is often located on the valve cover, on the top of the engine, but it can also be on a hose between the valve cover and the air intake filter.Just follow the hose on the top of the car engine, and you will find the PCV valve. Some cars do also have an integrated PCV valve with the valve cover."
how to make a PCV Valve Testing ? 	"The Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) valve is a small component in a vehicle's engine that helps to regulate the flow of air in and out of the engine's crankcase. The PCV valve helps to prevent buildup of harmful gases and pressure in the engine. Testing the PCV valve is an important part of routine maintenance for any vehicle, and here's how you can do it:Locate the PCV valve: The PCV valve is usually located on the valve cover, and it is connected to the engine via a hose.Remove the PCV valve: Disconnect the PCV valve from the engine and remove it from the valve cover. In some cases, the PCV valve may be stuck or difficult to remove, so you may need to use pliers or a wrench to gently twist and pull the valve out.Inspect the valve: Check the PCV valve for any visible signs of damage, such as cracks, breaks, or debris buildup. Shake the valve and listen for any rattling noises, which indicates that the valve is functioning properly.Test the valve: Blow air into the valve with your mouth and check for any resistance or blockages. Alternatively, you can use a vacuum gauge to test the valve. Connect the gauge to the end of the hose that was connected to the PCV valve and start the engine. Observe the gauge to see if it's reading within the manufacturer's recommended range.Replace the valve if necessary: If the PCV valve shows signs of damage, doesn't rattle when shaken, or fails the air or vacuum test, it needs to be replaced.Reinstall the valve: Reinstall the PCV valve and reconnect it to the engine.Testing the PCV valve is a quick and easy process that can help prevent engine damage and improve vehicle performance. If you're not confident in performing this task, it's best to consult with a professional mechanic."
PCV Valve Replacement Cost ?	"The average PCV valve replacement cost is between $50 and $250, depending on the car model and labor costs. A PCV Valve mostly costs between $20 and $50. The labor cost is between $30 and $200 at a mechanic workshop.The replacement cost of faulty PCV valves can differ significantly depending on the engine and the car you have. However, the PCV valve?s price is often meager, and you can expect prices of around $20-50 for a brand-new valve.If you think you have the knowledge to replace the valve yourself, you will not suffer from the labor costs, but remember that it can be difficult to replace it if it?s located under the manifold on some cars.If you want a mechanic to replace it for you, you can expect a labor cost of $30-200, depending on the location and the car type.If you have an older car, the PCV valves are often easy to replace and should only take around 10 minutes, while on newer cars, there could be a replacement time of over 3 hours if it?s located under the intake. Sometimes, you have to remove the intake to access the PCV valve; luckily, this is not very common."
Can you clean the PCV valve?	"If your PCV valve is clogged, you can definitely clean it. But usually, the spring mechanism inside the PCV valve gets old and bad. PCV valves are often quite cheap, so while you can clean it, we recommend replacing it to avoid problems in the near future."
Is the PCV valve necessary?	"Yes. Without the PCV valve, there may be too much underpressure in the crankcase during idle and too much overpressure in the crankcase during turbo boost. Additionally, the PCV valve also helps to improve fuel efficiency by recycling unburned fuel vapors back into the combustion chamber."
Is a PCV valve open at idle?	"The PCV valve is supposed to be closed or semi-closed during idle so as not to create too much vacuum inside the crankcase. When you press the throttle a little, the PCV valve opens fully to evacuate the crankcase gases."
How often should the PCV valve be changed?	"There is no schedule for when the PCV valve should be replaced. Often the PCV valve will last over 100,000 miles. However, the PCV valve is quite cheap and often quite easy to replace, so if your car is a couple of years old, you may want to replace the PCV valve."
Conclusion	"As you can see, most of the symptoms are engine performance problems, which could also be caused by other issues, so it?s important to research the subject carefully.If you notice any symptoms of a bad PCV valve in your vehicle, it?s time to take it to a mechanic and have them check your PCV valve. It?s a small part that plays a big role in keeping your engine healthy, so don?t wait too long to replace it if it needs fixing. Doing so will keep your car running smoothly for years to come!"
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad MAF Sensor ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad mass air flow sensor are engine performance issues such as rough acceleration or rough idling, along with a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice changes in fuel consumption, or black smoke from the exhaust.Because the mass airflow sensor is directly connected to the engine control system, any problem can interfere with performance. Here is a more detailed list of the most common bad MAF sensor symptoms to look for:1. Check Engine Light IlluminatesCheck Engine LightThe engine control module monitors all sensors in the car engine to ensure that everything is OK. If a sensor sends an incorrect signal, the ECM or PCM will turn on the check engine indicator light.Therefore, if your MAF sensor is faulty and sends wrong information to the engine control unit, the check engine light will illuminate your dashboard. A check engine light is one of the most common bad mass air flow sensor symptoms.However, the engine control module does not always recognize a faulty MAF sensor, so it may still be defective, even if there is no engine light on your dashboard. If your check engine light is illuminated, you will want to check the diagnostic trouble codes first with an OBD2 scanner.2. Slow AccelerationYour engine needs a perfect air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber for optimal performance. A faulty MAF sensor can cause a faulty air-fuel mixture, which can cause many strange performance issues with your car. Slow acceleration is one such possibility.If you notice that your car is much slower than usual, there is a significant risk that your MAF sensor is at fault.3. Hesitation, rough or jerky accelerationAs you may suspect, a faulty fuel injection caused by a poor MAF sensor can also make your acceleration rough or jerky.This is usually because the air-fuel mixture becomes too lean, so the car engine ?starves? due to a lack of food, and this will cause it to jerk.If the air-fuel mixture is too rich, it can also extinguish the ignition created by the spark plug, which causes the acceleration to be rough.4. Hard Starting ConditionIf you notice that your car has become more difficult to start in the morning, there is a chance that a bad air mass sensor is causing the problem.All car engines are very sensitive to the right airflow mixture at the exact starting moment. If the wrong amount of fuel is injected into the engine when you try to start your car, your car might crank a little longer than usual or it may even refuse to start at all.5. Black Smoke From Exhaust PipeBlack smoke coming from the exhaust pipe is a strong sign that your engine is getting too much fuel compared to the amount of air. Therefore, if you realize that a lot of black smoke is pouring out of your exhaust pipe, there is a significant risk that your engine is running too rich. A bad MAF sensor could be the cause.You might also notice a little more gray smoke from the exhaust pipe than usual if your engine runs rich. This can damage your catalytic converter. Your catalytic converter is a very expensive component, so you definitely want to fix this as soon as possible.6. Rough IdleYour car engine is most susceptible to engine problems when idling. This is because only a small amount of air and fuel will be injected into the engine, and a small margin of error will cause noticeable problems with your engine.If your engine idle is very rough or if the engine stalls at idle, there is a high chance that your mass air flow sensor is bad.7. MisfiresMisfires occur when one or more cylinders fail to burn the fuel. To burn the fuel correctly, the engine needs 3 things: the right air-fuel ratio, ignition, and compression.Therefore, if the air-fuel mixture is very far beyond the specifications, it may cause one or more cylinders not to ignite at all. The engine won?t ignite correctly, causing a misfire. If you find any trouble codes related to misfires, it can be a sign of a bad mass air flow sensor.8. Changed Fuel ConsumptionThis last symptom is probably the most obvious because you already know that a faulty MAF sensor is causing a faulty air-fuel mixture. Therefore, a faulty MAF sensor can cause fuel consumption to either go up or down.You may think that reduced fuel consumption is a good thing, but it can actually damage your engine, which will make it more expensive in the long run."
where the MAF Sensor Location ?	"The MAF sensor is located on the large hose between the intake manifold and the air filter box, often installed on the air filter box.Its exact location varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, as they fit the sensor based on the engine design.You can use a repair manual to find the exact location, or use the internet for a quick search. Check out the pictures for a clue as to where it can be placed."
how to Cleaning a Dirty MAF Sensor ?	"Often, the problems associated with the mass air flow sensor occur due to dirt and debris buildup on the sensor head. Over time, this particle accumulation results in poor performance of the sensor.Cleaning the MAF sensor is often relatively straightforward. Just remove the sensor head from the MAF sensor housing and carefully clean the sensor?s hot wire with an electronic cleaner or a specific MAF sensor cleaner.However, the sensor?s hot wire is very sensitive and you can easily damage it. You don?t want to touch it with your hands or with a towel! Just spray it and let it dry ? that should be enough!"
what is the  Diagnosing a Failing Mass Air Flow Sensor ?	"MAF sensors can often be quite expensive, and therefore it is important to make a correct diagnosis before choosing to replace the MAF sensor.Diagnosing an MAF sensor is often relatively easy if you know what to look for. But to diagnose the MAF sensor correctly, you must have correctly measured values for your specific car engine and model, which you can find in a repair manual.Connect an OBD2 scanner and check the live data from the MAF sensor on idle. It should be 0 mg.Start the car and check the values from the MAF sensor again. It should go up when you rev the engine, and down as the engine RPM decreases; if the value is stable, there is either something wrong with your diagnostic tool, the MAF sensor, or the wirings to it.Remove the plug from the MAF sensor and check for corrosion.Check your repair manual to measure the sensor and the wirings to it. You can find out more about how to test the MAF sensor in this video.Clean or Replace the MAF sensor if faulty or repair the wirings."
what is the MAF Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"The average MAF sensor replacement cost is between $140 and $550, depending on the car model and labor costs. A Mass Air Flow Sensor costs $100 and $400 and you can expect the labor costs to be $40 to $150.The MAF sensor is often quite expensive, as you sometimes have to replace the whole MAF sensor housing also, but even just the sensor itself can be quite expensive.Fortunately, it is often very easy to replace the MAF sensor, and this can be accomplished within 10 minutes with most car models. You can often do this yourself, even if you only have basic car knowledge.You do also want to look for any service bulletins for your particular car model before trying any repairs. For many vehicles like Isuzu you will find bulletins regarding the MAF sensor."
What happens when the MAF sensor goes bad?	"The MAF sensor is a vital part of the car engine, and therefore a lot of things can happen to your car engine when it goes bad. The most common things that happen are a control lamp, poor engine performance, uneven idling, and changed fuel consumption."
How do I test a MAF sensor?	"To test an MAF sensor, you need a multimeter to measure the resistance in the sensor. To know which resistance you should see on the multimeter, you can look it up in your repair manual for your car model."
Can I drive with a bad mass air flow sensor?	"A bad air mass sensor can cause many problems with your car engine, and therefore it is not recommended to drive with it. However, if your engine is running well, you can drive slowly to the nearest workshop."
How often does a mass air flow sensor need to be replaced?	"There is no service schedule for when to replace the MAF sensor. The MAF sensor is made to last the life of the vehicle, so it should only be replaced if it is faulty. However, you can clean the MAF sensor every 100,000 miles to keep it functional."
Conclusion	"Due to the importance of the MAF sensor for the car engine?s performance, it can lead to many different symptoms. Most of the signs you will notice are engine performance issues.Of course, these problems can be caused by other things as well, so it?s best to get your car diagnosed by yourself or a professional mechanic if you experience any problems. That said, if you have a faulty MAF sensor, replacing it as soon as possible is important."
What Are The Symptoms Of A Bad Oxygen Sensor?	"The most common bad oxygen sensor symptoms are poor engine performance and rough idle, along with a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice reduced fuel economy, and the car may fail an emissions inspection.Here is a more detailed list of the bad oxygen sensor symptoms:1. Check Engine Light IlluminatesCheck Engine LightOne of the most common bad oxygen sensor symptoms is a check engine light on your dashboard. In many cases, there can be a trouble code related to the oxygen sensor, and you don?t notice any other bad o2 sensor symptoms at all. All of the trouble codes P0030, P0031, P0130, P0131, P0132, P0133 and P0134 have to do with the oxygen sensors. You might also see P0137, P0140, P0141, P0161 or P0172 on your code scanner. With this in mind, you can see any number of trouble codes relating to an air-fuel mixture imbalance that could ultimately be caused by the oxygen sensor.2. Decreased Fuel EconomyFilling Gas In Diesel EngineInside the combustion chambers, there must be the right amount of air and fuel mixing. If there?s more fuel than air, your defective oxygen sensor might not be able to detect it. As more fuel burns in the engine, your gas mileage decreases. What you are left with is more money spent at the pump and more frequent trips to the gas station. 3. Rough IdleCar Engine Rough IdleIf you?ve noticed that the car runs roughly when it?s stopped or parked, the idle is off. Usually, a car should idle at around 1,000 or fewer RPMs. If it shoots up, that?s one of the bad o2 sensor symptoms.However, a rough idle isn?t always indicative of a bad oxygen sensor. It could mean any component that?s responsible for the air-fuel ratio is defective. That?s why you need to compare this symptom with the others. 4. Stalling EngineWhen the engine idle gets too rough, the motor could stall. This problem normally starts out as a misfire and doesn?t normally occur until the problem has been left unresolved. If the engine is unable to sustain the right amount of power to remain working, it will shut down. You should still be able to get it started again, but there are no guarantees.5. Poor Motor PerformanceIf the normal combustion process is interrupted, you can expect to notice trouble with the performance of the engine. It?s going to be weaker than normal, especially when you try to push on the gas pedal. At first, this problem can be so subtle that you don?t notice it?s occurring. The problems could continue getting worse until driving becomes cumbersome. That?s why it?s important to have the fault looked at as soon as you notice it, especially before the lack of acceleration leads to an accident on the road. If you notice that your engine performance has decreased, that?s a strong indicator that you may have a bad O2 sensor.6. Failed Emissions TestThe oxygen sensors are part of the emission control system in the vehicle. If they aren?t working, there could be an imbalance in the exhaust, which would be read through an emissions test. While there are numerous reasons you might fail these mandatory tests, the oxygen sensors tend to be a major culprit. If you have failed an emissions test, have the computer checked for codes that show you what the problem might be. 7. Strange SoundsWhen an oxygen sensor fails to monitor the air-fuel mixture, an abundance of carbon could build up in the combustion chamber. This problem could cause a lean-running mixture in the motor.With a lean mixture, you are left with pre-ignition that leads to pinging or knocking noises. However, these noises can also occur for other reasons, such as a clogged fuel injector, bad fuel, or engine damage. Most often, these noises are heard under engine load. 8. Catalytic Converter FailureWhat happens if you continue running the system with a bad oxygen sensor? Eventually, the catalytic converter will fail because of the imbalance of air and fuel. The oxygen sensors must be in optimal working order to prevent damage to the catalytic converter. It?s never cheap to replace a catalytic converter. For this reason alone, you want to fix the defective oxygen sensor because it causes bigger problems. "
where the Oxygen Sensor Location ?	"The oxygen sensor is found in the exhaust system. It can be found near the engine or on the exhaust manifold. Many cars have several oxygen sensors, but they are all monitoring the amount of oxygen in the exhaust.If the car has more than one oxygen sensor, the other will be located behind the catalytic converter. This sensor monitors the performance of the converter by comparing the readings occurring before and after. "
what the Oxygen Sensor Function ?	"The car engine uses a combustion process that produces exhaust gases once the fuel and air have ignited in the cylinders. These exhaust gases contain several components, such as oxygen and carbon. The oxygen sensors monitor the level of these gases in the exhaust as it?s leaving the motor. Whatever oxygen is flowing through the combustion process is measured by this sensor.The information received from the oxygen sensor is sent back to the engine control module (ECM). This computer is in charge of processing all of the information so adjustments can be made to the air and fuel ratio. If the ECM reads that there?s too much oxygen, it will adjust other sensors to add more fuel and vice versa. Otherwise, you are left with either a lean- or rich-running condition that creates engine problems. Not only will the bad oxygen sensor cause engine troubles, but it can also lead to further damage to other components. For example, as the imbalanced exhaust continues to flow through the catalytic converter, you are allowing additional wear to this expensive part. That?s why repair should be performed as soon as possible. "
what is the Oxygen Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"On average, you might spend $50 to $450 to replace a bad oxygen sensor. However, this price is based on several factors. The type of car and engine you drive has a lot to do with the cost.If you are driving a small economy car, your cost is probably going to be much less than the larger SUV or truck. Luxury cars also have more expensive parts that increase the overall total. Additionally, you might need a specialty mechanic to work on your luxury brand, which you wouldn?t need if you were driving a small Chevy.The other major factor has to do with the labor rate. If you can replace the oxygen sensor yourself, there?s no reason to pay a professional mechanic. Considering the oxygen sensor might only cost you $20 to $175, you can save a lot of money figuring this out on your own. The service manual or a repair manual is quite helpful when it comes to these fixes.The trouble comes in when you wait to change the oxygen sensors. By procrastinating with this repair, you can allow other damage to occur. For this reason, what would have been a simple repair can quickly turn into something more costly. That?s why we always recommend changing the defective oxygen sensor at the first sign of trouble. Compare the costs of replacing an oxygen sensor with swapping out the catalytic converter. For a typical catalytic converter replacement, you are looking at an average of $1,000 to $2,500 to have it worked on by a professional. However, most of this cost isn?t related to the labor costs but how expensive the part is. That?s why it?s best to spend the money upfront and get the oxygen sensors working right than deal with what?s coming down the road as a result of neglect. "
What happens if you don?t replace the oxygen sensor?	"If the oxygen sensor isn?t replaced, the car?s computer won?t be able to monitor the air/fuel mixture accurately. As a result, the car?s engine will run either too rich (with too much fuel) or too lean (with not enough fuel). This can cause all sorts of problems, including excessive emissions, poor fuel economy. In the long run, it will cause excessive wear on the engine, which can damage expensive parts like the catalytic converter or internal engine parts."
Can I drive with a bad oxygen sensor?	"While you can drive your car with a bad oxygen sensor in most cases, it is not recommended, as it can cause the car to run lean or rich and potentially damage the engine. However, if you are on your way to the mechanic, you can still drive the car as long as you are aware of the potential risks."
Can I replace the oxygen sensor myself?	"Yes. Replacing an oxygen sensor is in most cases a fairly simple job. However, it depends on the make and model of your car. In some cases, if the car is older, the oxygen sensor can get stuck because of rust, and it can be difficult to remove it without special tools."
Will check engine light reset after replacing the O2 sensor?	"It depends on the make and model of your car. For most cars, the answer is ?yes.? The check engine light will reset after replacing the O2 sensor, but it can take a while. Every time you start the engine and warm it up, the car checks the emissions. It may take 10-20 successful cycles before the engine control module understands that the oxygen sensor is working and removes the light. So it?s definitely easier to clear the error code with a scanner."
Conclusion	"There are a few symptoms that can point to a bad oxygen sensor, but the best way to know for sure is by using an OBD-II scanner or letting a professional mechanic diagnose the car. If you notice any of these problems with your vehicle, be sure to take it in for service as soon as possible"
What is Normal Engine Oil Pressure?	"The oil pressure of a vehicle depends on what make and model it is. In general, the normal oil pressure will fall somewhere between 20 and 65 PSI. You can find your vehicle?s specifications in the service manual. Anything outside the recommended range is considered bad.Your motor?s oil pressure shows how much resistance the lubricant faces when traveling through the various passages of your car engine. The majority of cars have an oil pressure gauge on the dashboard, so you can see how high or low it is at any time.When you initially start up the vehicle, the oil pressure may be higher than normal. Once the engine warms up to its normal operating temperature, the oil pressure reading should be normal. It?s usually measured by PSI or pounds per square inch. "
Why is Normal Oil Pressure Important?	"The oil pressure rating shows how much resistance the lubricant faces as it travels through the passages. When everything is in optimal condition, the oil pressure is going to be normal. Any time that the oil pressure is low or high, it indicates that there?s a problem. By knowing where it should be, you can head off bigger problems before they cost you too much.Either way, the oil needs to get to every engine component. Otherwise, those parts of the engine aren?t getting the lubrication they need. Without lubrication, friction increases and component damage is sure to follow. "
what are the Main Causes of High Oil Pressure ?	"1. Dirty Oil FilterBad Oil FilterThe engine oil filter is responsible for keeping the contaminants out of the combustion chamber. Over time, soot, dust and other debris are going to build up on the filter, which is why it should be changed with every oil change.If the filter isn?t changed, the oil won?t be able to flow normally, which could lead to increased pressure in the system. The higher the resistance goes, the more the pressure rises. RELATED: 5 Signs of a Bad or Clogged Oil Filter 2. Diminished Oil QualityThe reason for changing the oil frequently is to keep the contaminants out of the lubricant. If these contaminants build up, the quality of the oil is sacrificed.Because these contaminants reduce friction, more resistance occurs. This resistance can lead to an increase in pressure. 3. Wrong Oil ViscosityEvery engine uses a specific type of oil with a particular viscosity rating. The more viscous the oil is, the more resistance it has when traveling through the passageways. This higher viscosity increases pressure.If you choose a thinner or thicker oil, you will alter the pressure that is noticed in the system. Additionally, you have to keep in mind that oil becomes thinner after it heats up, so viscosity is also adjusted by heat. 4. Blocked PassagesThe oil moves through the filter into various passages that lead to the engine. If any of the passages get blocked, oil won?t be able to pass as efficiently, leading to a lack of lubrication.With more resistance, the oil pressure will rise. The obstruction can also lead to engine failure, as lubrication doesn?t occur. 5. Bad Relief ValveThe relief valve is needed to allow oil the chance to escape if the pressure rises. The valves will open once the PSI reaches a certain level.If this relief valve no longer functions as it should, the oil has nowhere to escape. Because of this defect, the pressure will build up until it is no longer safe for the motor. "
what are the Main Causes of Low Oil Pressure ?	"1. Low Oil LevelLow Oil LevelThe dipstick shows how much oil should be in the system. If this level drops too low, you could face reduced pressure within the engine. The engine will burn some oil over time, which is why it?s important to check the levels frequently. Also, if a leak occurs, the oil level will decrease until the pressure drops. 2. Wrong ViscosityAs we discussed earlier, the oil viscosity plays a major part in the pressure level. If the oil is too thick, it might increase the oil pressure because of the heightened resistance. Lower viscosity has the opposite effect on the pressure. That?s why it?s important to follow the recommendations set out by the automaker. 3. Clogged FilterWe had the clogged filter in our section on high pressure, but it also belongs here. It depends on where the oil pressure sensor is located. If it is placed before the filter, it will show a high pressure when the filter is clogged. If it is placed after the filter, it will show a low oil pressure when it is clogged.If the oil can no longer flow through the engine, pressure will drop. That?s why you should always replace the filter when you change the oil. 4. Failing Oil PumpThe oil pump is responsible for regulating pressure. If the pump begins to malfunction, low pressure is sure to follow. The engine could also stall and the temperature may rise. Aside from that, there will be a lack of power without the necessary oil to run the engine. 5. Engine WearIf the engine is getting old and starting to wear, low oil pressure is common. Inside the engine, there are lots of moving parts that need to be well-lubricated to avoid damage. Any components in the engine, including the bearings, can fail at any moment, causing a dramatic drop in oil pressure.Sadly, there?s no way to tell how long the engine will last before damage occurs. However, you can keep it in its best condition by providing regular maintenance and fixing problems as soon as they occur. "
What is Normal Oil Pressure at Idle?	"The oil pressure will be slightly lower at idle, normally between 20 and 30 PSI on most car engines. Normally, it won?t go below the specified parameters set by the manufacturer. If the oil pressure drops too low during idle, it could indicate that the level is low and needs to be topped off. "
Is It Better to Have High or Low Oil Pressure?	"Neither of these situations is ideal, and you don?t want to face either, but high oil pressure is usually slightly better than low oil pressure. But, engine damage can occur when the oil pressure is too high, just as it would if the oil pressure dropped too low. For that reason, it?s imperative to have your car looked at if the oil pressure gauge reads low or high. "
Does Oil Pressure Go Up As You Drive?	"You may notice a slight increase in oil pressure as you accelerate. This condition is completely normal because the motor is working harder, so it needs more pressure. However, the pressure should never go beyond what?s considered normal by the manufacturer. "
Conclusion	"The only way to know that it has exceeded normal parameters is to verify what the pressure should be. If you are keeping a close eye on the oil pressure of your car, you may notice it becomes too high or too low. With both of these conditions, it?s important to seek help right away from a technician to avoid any permanent engine damage."
What Is the Firing Order of a Chevy 350?	"The Chevy 350 has a firing order of 1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2. The majority of Chevy old-school motors contain this firing order. This firing order reflects the firing sequence of the spark plugs and wires if the engine utilizes a distributor. For the spark plugs to fire correctly, the Chevy 350 must be wired this way.To set up this firing order, you need to figure out when the piston hits top dead center during the compression stroke. It?s vital that the rotor inside the distributor is aligned with the right spark plug terminal for the firing order to work correctly. With the Chevy 350 engine, you start with the first spark plug (#1), located in the distributor cap. Some small block engines use the High Energy Ignition (HEI) distributor. In this setup, the electric energy moves from the ignition coil directly to the spark plug, working clockwise. There?s an exception to this firing order with the Chevy 350. LS engines can also be a 350, but the firing order is 1-8-7-2-6-5-4-3. If you aren?t sure how your Chevy engine is wired, it?s best to reference the information found in your service manual. Even if you think you are sure, double-checking won?t hurt. "
What is a Chevy 350 Engine?	"Chevy 350 engines are 350 cubic inches or 5.7-liter. All of these engines are a small block V8 that contain a 4.00-inch bore and 3.48-inch stroke. Horsepower ranges from 145 to over 370, depending on the make, model and year of the vehicle. It can also push out up to 380 lb-ft of torque, making it a great choice for towing. However, fuel mileage is never a strong suit of this V8 engine.The 350 small block engine was first seen in the 1967 Camaro as the L-48 high-performance motor. Only a year later, it was placed in the Chevrolet Nova. By 1969, the entire Chevy lineup had a 350. GM relies on the use of RPO (Regular Production Option) codes that identify the engines. You can find the 350 code stamped onto the cylinder head, probably on the passenger side of the vehicle. However, the alternator may conceal it, requiring a little more effort. Most of the engine codes begin with an L, such as the L31 or L46, but some have other designations, such as the ZQ3. "
What is an Engine?s Firing Order?	"The firing order shows the sequence of when the spark plugs fire. The engine can?t run correctly without a firing order. If you have the firing order correct, the engine will run exactly as it was intended. Otherwise, the ride could become rough or it could cause the engine not to run at all. Using our 1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2 firing order, it?s clear that the first spark plug to fire will be #1. After that, #8, #4, #3, #6, #5, #7 and #2 will all follow in order. This order of ignition helps to create the spark where it is needed. As the combustion pressure causes the pistons to move in a downward motion, the transmission gears and crankshaft also move in time. This movement is what creates the forward or backward motion needed to go somewhere. "
What Makes the Firing Order Important?	"One would think it wouldn?t matter how a car?s spark plugs would fire, but it must be done orderly or there could be problems. The sequence of the cylinders is important to both the fuel economy and performance of the motor. It can also impact the engine?s emissions. If the cylinders didn?t fire in the right order, unburned fuel would come out of the engine. Depending on how severe the condition is, the improper fuel and air ratio would also lead to a no-start situation. At the very least, you are going to notice serious performance issues. "
differences between Small and  Big Block Chevy Firing Order ?	"The majority of small and big block Chevy firing orders are the same. With both, the most likely firing order will be 1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2. The small block engines following this firing order include the following models: Chevy 265Chevy 283Chevy 302Chevy 327Chevy 350Chevy 400On the other hand, you can also find the firing order with the big block engines. Some of these include:Chevy 396Chevy 406Chevy 427Chevy 454With both these small and big block engines, you get a powerful V8. All of these motors are designed to pump out maximum power for an enjoyable ride. The newer small block engines are different. These are known as LS engines. With the 350, your firing order will be 1-8-7-2-6-5-4-3.So, what is the difference between the small and big block Chevy? The size is the primary difference. Big block Chevy motors are bigger than the small block. It will also weigh more, but it can create more power. "
Other Chevy Firing Orders 	"1. 327The Chevy 327 was placed in cars from 1962 until 1969. In the final year, it was included as the standard V8 in all full-size models, helping to reduce the cost over the 307 V8 found in the Camaro, Nova and Chevelle.The 327 small block Chevy engine has the same firing order as the 350. If you need to set the firing order, the Chevy 327 firing order is 1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2.2. 454In 1970, the 454 was introduced as a 7.4-liter. It was first introduced in the Corvette LS-5 and featured 390 horsepower. Later, a 465-horsepower model was released. The 454 big block Chevy engine contains the same firing order as the small block 350. Set it for 1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2.3. 5.3-LiterThe 5.3-liter Chevy engine is a newer model. For this reason, it features a different firing order from the 350.In the 5.3 liters 350 engines, the firing order is 1-8-7-2-6-5-4-3. Odd cylinders are located on the driver?s side of the car, while even cylinders will be found on the passenger?s side. 4. With HEI Distributor CapThe High Energy Ignition (HEI) distributor cap is newer technology. This distributor sends the voltage from the ignition coil to the plug. Even with the HEI distributor cap, the firing order remains the same as the 350 small block. It is 1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2."
What If the Firing Order of a Chevy 350 is Wrong?	"If you misroute the spark plugs on an older engine that has a distributor, the motor could misfire, run poorly or fail to start. If you?ve just changed the plugs or wires and face performance issues, it?s possible that the firing order is set up incorrectly. Avoid this problem by replacing one plug and wire at a time. "
How Do I Fix the Wrong Chevy 350 Firing Order?	"If you?ve set up the firing order of a Chevy 350 wrong, you need to fix it before you are able to drive normally. Rotate the crankshaft by hand until the timing mark lines up with the Top Dead Center (TDC) indicator on the timing cover. Take off the distributor cap and make a note about where the rotor points. It needs to be facing the number one terminal on the cap. If not, rotate the crankshaft again to turn the rotor until it reaches the number one position. Trace each wire and ensure it connects to the proper spark plug. "
Where is the Number 1 on a Chevy 350 Distributor Cap?	"With your Chevy 350 motor, the cylinder numbers begin at the engine?s front, starting on the driver?s side. The second cylinder is toward the front of the passenger?s side. These cylinder numbers move from the left to the right, switching sides. If you have trouble finding them, use a Chevy 350 firing order diagram. "
Where Can I Find a Chevy 350 Firing Order Diagram?	"To help you identify the proper firing order for your Chevy 350, we?ve included a diagram. However, there are other places to find the information if you need it. Look in your Chevy service manual or do a quick search online to find the appropriate firing order. "
Conclusion	"The benefit of having newer cars with an coil over plug design is that you no longer have to worry about firing orders. Still, if you love your Chevy 350 and you don?t mind working on it, knowing the correct firing order is sure to save you a lot of trouble. The majority of firing orders for a Chevy 350 are 1-8-4-3-6-5-7-2, although a few can be different.For this reason, it?s best to reference the information found in your Chevy?s service manual. Because using the wrong firing order can lead to a world of trouble, you don?t want to make any mistakes. Make sure your engine runs as it should by hooking up the distributor with the right Chevy 350 firing order the first time. If you need more help, talk to your local auto repair shop."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Tensioner Pulley ?	"A bad tensioner pulley will create a squeaking, chirping, or grinding sound. It can also lead to strange belt wear and cause accessories to fail, resulting in a burning smell. Furthermore, there could be physical signs of wear or damage to the pulley itself if you know where to look.Here is a more detailed list of the most common symptoms of a bad tensioner pulley:1. Strange NoisesNoise From CarMost commonly, when the tensioner pulley starts to go bad, the noise will be the first thing that?s noticed. As the tensioner gets looser, the belts are going to make a squeaking or chirping noise. This sound might be most noticeable when you first start up the engine. It becomes quite annoying and is a top complaint among car owners. As the bearing or pulley wears out completely, the noise will often change. At this point, the pulley can start to produce a grinding noise, which is even more alarming. 2. Excessive Belt WearCracked Serpentine BeltIf the drive belt tensioner or pulley starts to fail, you might start to have trouble with the belt itself. You could notice some excessive or unusual wear to the belt. With a tensioner failure, there could be issues with the pulley too. Because of this, the belt edges can start to fray. In extreme cases, you could face a broken belt, which is never good news. Ideally, you will replace the pulley before the situation gets this bad. 3. Burnt SmellSmell CarIf the tensioner pulley is bad and won?t tension the serpentine belt properly, it will cause the belt to loosen and begin to slip on the accessories pulleys. This can create a burning rubber smell when you drive your car.If you notice a burnt smell, you definitely want to inspect the belt and tensioner pulley as soon as possible.4. Failing AccessoriesSerpentine Belt CarThe belt is held by the tensioner and the pulley. The belt responsible for running multiple accessories. In most cars, this belt runs components such as the AC compressor, water pump and alternator. If the belt becomes loose or breaks, power to these parts fails. These accessories are going to become disabled and you could start to notice strange issues. The alternator may stop charging, the engine could overheat, and the air conditioning may become disabled. If a bad pulley or tensioner leads to a broken belt, you will have a larger repair bill. Not only will you have to replace the pulley, but also the belt and other parts that get wiped out. 5. Physical DamageIf you are mechanically inclined, you can physically inspect the tensioner pulley to see what?s going on. Once you remove the drive belt, you should be able rotate the pulley by hand. If there?s roughness, noise or resistance to the pulley when trying to turn, you could be looking at an issue with the bearings within.Further examination of the tensioner pulley could reveal chips, dents or cracks. This isn?t a normal occurrence, as the new pulley would have a smooth surface. If there are any areas that are grooved, you don?t want to see any particles or debris located within. All of the high points should be equal, leaving no inconsistencies that could lead to trouble. The physical inspection isn?t the first way to notice that there?s an issue. Instead, it should be used to strictly confirm what you already believe to be true based on the other symptoms we?ve covered. Additionally, you don?t want to start messing around under the hood to perform an inspection or replacement unless you know what you are looking at. "
What Is A Tensioner Pulley?	"The car engine is more complex than you might think. For the engine to run its best and produce power where it?s needed, a whole bunch of other components must work in conjunction with one another. One of these essential parts is the tensioner pulley, which isn?t talked about often. The tensioner pulley works with the serpentine belt in today?s cars. It doesn?t matter what type of vehicle you drive, the design is going to remain the same. This pulley is required to ensure there?s enough tension on the belt while it rotates around the various accessories that it runs. The serpentine belt can run the alternator, crankshaft, water pump and AC components, so it will weave itself in and out of these parts. The tensioner pulley maintains the right amount of pressure on the belt or chain. It must create tension to keep the belt moving as it needs to. Within the pulley, there?s often a bearing and internal hub. Most often, it?s the bearing inside the pulley that goes bad. This bearing gets mounted to the tensioner with the help of bolt. With this design, the tensioner can pivot, creating the appropriate amount of tension. "
where the Tensioner Pulley Location ?	"You can find the tensioner pulley at the end of the tensioner, which is spring-loaded. The accessory belt rides across the pulley, with the spring-loaded part of the assembly putting tension on the belt. It must have the right amount of tension so it doesn?t slip from the pulleys. In some cases, the tensioner isn?t the part that goes bad. Sometimes, it?s the pulley that fails because of the bearing. For this reason, you can purchase a pulley for replacement instead of getting the tensioner. We will discuss more about that in a minute.To find the tensioner pulley, you can follow these steps.Open the vehicle?s hood.Look across the accessory drive belt to find the tensioner. The pulley is with the tensioner and it contains a smooth surface toward the belt?s top. Where the belt rides, there will be no grooves.If you can?t seem to find the tensioner pulley, go ahead and reference your vehicle?s service manual. Otherwise, you might need help from a local mechanic or dealership. "
what is the Tensioner Pulley Replacement Cost ?	"On average, you might spend between $100 and $400 to have the tensioner pulley replaced. Your parts may only cost $50 to $250, while the labor could be an additional $50 to $150. If you can do the work yourself, it?s possible to save on labor costs by performing the replacement in your home garage. You don?t want to drive with a bad tensioner pulley. It?s not going to keep working once it has hit the end of its lifespan. If more damage occurs, you could harm the accessories or engine, so it?s best to get it looked at right away. During replacement, you also have several options. Some people suggest replacing the pulley bearings, but that can be just as much work. Additionally, there are some mechanics that believe replacing the tensioner system is the right way to go. The thought is that the bad pulley might have caused wear to the tensioner. If you want to be safe, this would be the right path to take, but it will add to your repair cost. However, you will know that the tensioner is in good shape instead of wondering what happened when the pulley went bad. "
How to Remove the Tensioner Pulley?	"In most cars, it?s not difficult to remove the tensioner pulley and replace it, as long as you have the right equipment. You can find directions in your car?s service manual. Otherwise, here are a few general steps to follow.Follow the steps listed above to locate the tensioner pulley. You will find it under the hood.Use a socket that matches the bolt on the pulley. Turn the socket counterclockwise to loosen up the bolt. If the tensioner is trying to move, you may have trouble getting the bolt loose. In this case, you must keep the tensioner in place by holding it securely with a pry bar. Remove the bolt in the pulley to take out the defective part.Carefully replace it with a new one. If this becomes too complicated for you to complete or you are having trouble getting the bolt loose, it?s best to visit a professional repair shop. For the cost of having it replaced, it?s not worth breaking something because of the struggle."
Can you drive with a bad tensioner pulley?	"No, you shouldn?t drive with a bad tensioner pulley. If it fails completely, it can cause the serpentine belt to break causing the alternator to not charge your car battery. This will cause your car to stall and shut off."
What causes a tensioner pulley to fail?	"The most common causes of a failed tensioner pulley are simply due to age, or it is made of poor quality. Tensioner pulleys usually have no maintenance or scheduled maintenance in most car models, but they can still break during the life of the car."
How long does a tensioner pulley last?	"Tensioner pulleys are built to last the life of the car. In most car models, there is no scheduled replacement of the tensioner pulley. They should be checked during each service and replaced if they are bad or failing."
What happens if the tensioner pulley fails?	"If the tensioner pulley fails, it will cause the serpentine belt to jump or snap off. This will cause the power steering, alternator, A/C compressor, and more, depending on the car model, to stop working. It can lead to serious engine damage if you are unlucky."
Conclusion	"A failing tensioner pulley can cause the serpentine belt to slip or break, resulting in expensive engine damage. Therefore, if you suspect your car has a bad or failing tensioner pulley, have it checked yourself or by a mechanic as soon as possible to avoid engine damage."
How Much Does an Oil Pan Replacement Cost?	"The average oil pan replacement cost is between $250 and $1,000, depending on the car model and who installs the new oil pan. The oil pan itself may cost $150 to $500, including a drain plug and oil pan gasket, with the rest being labor costs.It?s difficult to determine a precise cost since the labor for replacement varies so greatly. Some people may be able to get the job accomplished for $250, while others can cost $1,500 or more. It all depends on the type of vehicle you drive, who is installing the new oil pan, and what other parts are required.Let?s take a look at the factors affecting the oil pan replacement cost."
what is the Factors Affecting Oil Pan Replacement Cost ?	"1. Vehicle Make/ModelThe most important factor is what type of vehicle you are driving. As with any auto part, prices can vary for the components themselves. It will matter if you are driving a compact vehicle or something more heavy-duty.Additionally, there are some vehicles that have a more labor-intensive replacement procedure. In fact, some vehicles require the engine to be pulled to get to the oil pan, which can become quite costly to do. 2. DIY vs. ProfessionalIf you plan to perform the oil pan replacement at home, you could save yourself a lot of money. All you would need to pay for is the parts.Otherwise, you are liable for paying a professional for the replacement. If you live in an area with a high labor rate, this cost can add up pretty quickly. RELATED: Mechanic Labor Rates Per Hour3. Other Parts RequiredIf the oil pan needs to be replaced, it?s likely you might need other parts as well. During the installation, the technician might want to replace the oil plug, oil pan gasket or an oil plug gasket.Sometimes, the oil pan comes with the plug and gaskets, especially if it is a complete kit. If that?s the case, you may be able to save some money. Just don?t forget that the engine will also need to be refilled with oil too. "
What is the Oil Pan?	"The oil pan is needed for exactly what it sounds like. It?s the pan that holds the engine oil for your vehicle.This pan looks like a tray, and it acts as a reservoir. The oil sits in the pan before it is pumped into the engine. Typically, this tray is made from aluminum or steel, and it gets bolted at the bottom of the motor. Oil Pan Parts1. Oil Pan GasketOil Pan GasketBetween the oil pan land the engine block, there needs to be something that helps to seal it. A gasket acts as this barrier and is sometimes installed with a sealant that keeps the oil from leaking.This gasket is made from a rubber material, fibers or cork ring. Over time, this gasket can break down and cause problems. For this reason, it?s best to replace it while you already have the oil pan off. 2. Drain Plug & GasketOil Drain PlugInserted into the drain pan is the plug. This is the part that gets removed when you do an oil change. With the plug out, the oil can drain. With the plug is also a gasket. With the help of this gasket, oil won?t leak through the threaded area of the drain plug. 3. Baffle/Windage TraySome vehicles also use a baffle or windage tray in the pan. This metal sheet helps to prevent oil from sloshing around as you go through turns.It can also prevent contamination of the crankshaft. Some trays also include a scraper mechanism that removes any oil that may have sloshed around. "
Reasons Why Oil Pan Fails ?	"1. ImpactThe main reason that an oil pan fails is because of an impact. If you run something over in your car, it could cause damage to the oil pan, which is sitting underneath the engine.It?s also possible that the damage stems from an accident you?ve had. Either way, you might start to notice oil leaking from under the car. 2. CorrosionBecause the oil pan is made from metal, it can easily corrode. As the car gets older, the metal will oxidize until rust starts to form.Corrosion can occur even faster if you live in a salty area, such as near the beach or if you regularly drive on winter-treated roadways. If so, you would do better to get the undercarriage of your vehicle washed regularly to ensure all of this salt is removed. 3. Worn GasketIn some cases, people think that the oil pan has failed when it?s just the gasket that?s leaking. As the vehicle ages, the gasket material will start to break down. It can also fail from the constant fluctuation between extreme heat and regular ambient temperatures.With rubber gaskets, the material will harden over time and lose elasticity. Either way, you may not need an oil pan replacement if the problem is just from the gasket. "
How to Replace Oil Pan: DIY Steps ?	"1. Gather SuppliesMotor Oil PanIf you plan on replacing the oil pan yourself, it?s best to gather all of your supplies before you get started. Otherwise, you could find yourself in the middle of the project running to the store. With a few simple tools, it?s normally easy to get the old oil pan off. However, that?s not always the case, especially if you drive a car that requires pulling the engine for replacement. For this reason, we advise you to read the service manual first.Once that?s done, gather these tools and equipment.Floor jack and jack standsNew oil pan & kitFresh motor oil (whatever viscosity and type is recommended)Socket wrenchOil filterSealantClean ragsIn addition to these items, you want to gather anything else listed in your service manual. With your equipment ready, you can move on to the next step. 2. Jack Up CarIt?s very important that your car is level to get the oil drained completely. You can do this by using a floor jack, and some jack stands. If your vehicle is already pretty far off of the ground, you might be able to get underneath and perform the replacement without jacking it up.Otherwise, jack up your car and secure it on stands. Make sure you place the stands in the appropriate place based on manufacturer recommendations. 3. Drain OilBefore you go any further, you must drain out the old oil from the pan. Place a drain pan under the plug and pull it out. You will need a socket to remove this plug in most cases. Turn the plug until it?s loose and remove it by hand. Put the plug in a safe place unless you plan on replacing it. 4. Take Off Old PanAfter the oil has been drained, you are able to take off the old pan. The steps to do this may vary by vehicle.Find the bolts holding it on and loosen them. Take a rag and clean off the area where the old pan is attached to the engine block. You will probably find a good amount of debris on these surfaces, including some metal shards. 5. Replace with New PanBefore you put the new pan on, run your sealant around the surface, so you can attach the new gasket. Once the gasket is in place, you can put on a new pan.Put the bolts back in place and make sure everything is tightened to spec. Do not overtighten the screws or you can strip the holes. 6. Replace Oil & FilterWhile you are performing an oil change, you might as well install a new oil filter too. Screw the filter in place.After that, fill the engine back up with the right type of oil. Make sure you check the levels after you bring the car down off of the jacks. Also, check for any leaks in the system before you start driving. 7. Consult a Mechanic for More HelpIf any part of this repair makes you uncomfortable, you should talk to a mechanic. While this can be a simple task, it?s not meant for everyone.It?s best to pay the labor fee to have a professional perform the installation than to break something in the process. Even stripping a bolt can lead to a world of trouble."
Is Replacing An Oil Pan Easy?	"Replacing the oil pan is fairly simple and straightforward in most car models and can be done with some basic mechanic skills, with the help of a repair manual. However, in some car models, you have to lift the engine to remove the oil pan, and in that case it is much more difficult."
Can I drive a car with an oil pan leak?	"Although you can drive a car with a leaking oil pan, it is not recommended for many reasons. First of all, when the car engine leaks oil, it can result in a low engine oil level that can damage your engine. It is also bad for the environment and also a safety hazard for other cars, due to the fact that oil on the road can be very slippery."
How Long Does It Take To Replace The Oil Pan?	"It usually takes between 2 and 4 hours for a professional mechanic to replace an oil pan. In some car models, changing the oil pan is much more difficult and you may have to lift the engine, which will greatly increase the change time."
How often should an oil pan be replaced?	"There is no set schedule for when the oil pan should be replaced. The oil pan is usually replaced when it starts to leak or when it is very rusty or corroded, depending on whether your car model has a steel or aluminum oil pan."
Conclusion	"You can expect to pay between $250 and $1,000 if you have the oil pan replaced by a professional. However, in some car models, you may need to lift or remove the engine to replace the oil pan, and in this case, it will cost much more. Luckily it?s just in a few car models.Replacing the oil pan yourself is not a difficult task in most car models, and you can save a lot of money by doing it with some basic mechanic skills. You may only need to buy a new oil pan for $150 to $500, and if you can install it for free, it will be quite cheap."
What Could Be Wrong If My Car Hesitates To Start?	"The most common reasons a car hesitates to start include fuel supply issues, bad engine sensors, and ignition problems such as bad spark plugs or ignition coils. A bad starter motor or low battery voltage can also be the problem.There are many different parts that can make your car engine hesitate to start, and therefore it is important to start looking for the problem correctly. Most modern cars use advanced computers that monitor every sensor in your car.If a sensor fails, it will store a trouble code. Therefore, it?s important to read the OBD trouble codes with a code scanner before you start replacing any parts or doing any further diagnosis.However, here are some things that may make your car hesitate to start:1. Fuel Delivery IssuesAir and fuel are needed for the car to run, and enough fuel must also reach the engine to get a proper start. If there is a problem with the fuel system, it can prevent the right amount of fuel from getting to where it belongs.There are many parts in the fuel system but if your diagnosis has led to the fuel system, you must determine what part has failed and replace it. You could be looking at issues with a clogged fuel filter, fuel injectors, or a malfunctioning fuel pump causing a low fuel pressure.During the start-up moment, the engine needs to inject much more fuel into the cylinders than when it is running, and therefore, low fuel pressure can cause this problem.2. Bad engine sensorA bad engine sensor can cause the engine control module to inject too much or too little fuel into the engine during the start-up moment, which results in a rich or lean air-fuel mixture. There are many sensors in your car, so it is important to check the error codes first as discussed earlier.If your car hesitates to start when the engine is warm or cold, that?s a strong symptom you could be facing a bad engine coolant temperature sensor. The MAF sensor or a bad camshaft position sensor could also cause starting issues.3. Bad Battery/ConnectionThe car battery provides the voltage needed to crank the engine over and get it started. As the battery starts to fail, it can?t provide enough voltage to get the engine cranked over right away. Instead, it might take some time. The older the battery becomes, the fewer cranking amps it can provide. This is most prevalent when the temperatures get colder. If the battery is in good condition, your issue could be related to the connection. If there?s any corrosion on the battery cables or posts, the battery won?t be able to transmit the power needed when starting the vehicle.You should do a visual inspection of the battery connections to ensure everything is clear. If you need to clean it off, you can use baking soda and water. You also want to check the health of the battery periodically. You can take it to most auto parts stores for a free check. As soon as the battery starts to die, replace it so you aren?t left stranded. 4. Fouled Spark Plugs or Ignition CoilsAside from the charging and electrical side of starting a car, you also have the ignition system to contend with. As spark plugs start to fail, they can make it harder to get the engine running. As the plugs get older, you might also notice some performance issues, such as a rough idle or a misfire. If you are changing the spark plugs at recommended intervals, this shouldn?t be an issue. However, if you haven?t changed the plugs and the engine is getting hard to start, it doesn?t hurt to pull them and take a look. They might need to be replaced. The ignition coils send power to the spark plugs, and if the ignition coils are going bad, it could cause a weak spark.5. Poor Fuel QualityNot many people think about the type of fuel that?s going into the car. In fact, you might be trying to find the least expensive option without caring what it could do to the engine. However, poor fuel quality leads to clogged injectors, failing spark plugs and a whole host of other issues. If you think you?ve put bad fuel in, you can try an additive to get the car running. After that, be sure to only fill up at places with top-tier fuel for better protection. 6. Malfunctioning StarterAs the starter motor begins to wear, the vehicle might be slower to turn over. Once the key is turned, an electromagnet activates, forcing the starter gear to engage. This action causes the starter to turn the flywheel fast enough until the engine can take it over. If it?s not able to spin fast enough, the car is going to struggle to start.The best way to check the starter is to have it bench tested. If you don?t know how to do this, most auto parts stores will do it for free. 7. Clogged Air FilterThe engine needs the right amount of air and fuel to get started. If the air filter has become clogged, one part of the equation isn?t making it to the combustion chamber, possibly causing some hesitation. You can easily check the air filter in most cars. Plus, it?s not expensive to put a new one in. Follow the recommended maintenance schedule to ensure this vital component is never clogged. 8. Failing AlternatorAs the alternator fails, it can also cause trouble starting the car. The alternator needs to charge the battery while the vehicle is running, but if it doesn?t, you might not have the cranking power you need. Many people don?t realize the alternator is bad until they replace a battery and find out that wasn?t the issue.You can have the alternator tested at your local auto parts store as well. Otherwise, you can test it yourself. With a multimeter, test the battery voltage with the car engine off. Test it again with the battery running. The number should be higher with the engine running.

Vehicle Hesitates to Start When Cold ?	"If the car is only having trouble getting started when cold, it could be due to the battery struggling to supply the cold cranking amperage that?s needed. As you choose a battery, you will find two separate amperage ratings. The first one to look at is the cranking amps, while the second is cold cranking amperage (CCA).When temperatures are mild, the battery can supply the full amount of cranking amperage without a problem. It?s when the temperatures drop that problems start to occur. The CCA rating shows how many amps the battery provides to the car starter for thirty seconds at 0øF. For this reason, the CCA rating will always be lower than the typical cranking amperage. While most cars are designed to start up with the amount of CCA listed on the battery, there are problems as it gets older. Once the battery begins aging, the CCA starts to decline. You might not notice the problem in the summer months because the CCA isn?t needed. That?s why it?s important to check the health of your car battery before winter sets in. By knowing that it is struggling ahead of time, you can prevent getting stuck with a car engine that won?t start. "
Conclusion	"If your car hesitates when you try to start it, there are a few potential causes of this. It could be something as simple as dirty spark plugs or a clogged air filter. However, it can also be a sign of a more serious problem, such as a broken alternator or starter motor.If you are unsure what the cause is, take your car to a mechanic and have them diagnose the problem. With their help, you can get your car back on the road in no time. If you want to try it yourself, you can also check through our other similar articles about the issue down below."
What is an Engine Misfire?	"An engine misfire is an event that occurs when one or more of the engine?s cylinders fail to ignite the air/fuel mixture during the combustion cycle. This can lead to a variety of engine performance issues and can even lead to serious engine damage if left untreated.For complete cylinder combustion to occur, the engine needs three important things, and that is the correct air/fuel mixture, compression, and spark. If any of these are missing or incorrect, the cylinder combustion will not be done correctly, and no power will be created.The engine control module monitors the crankshaft rotation speed with the crankshaft position sensor, and if the speed does not increase slightly on a cylinder after the combustion, it means that the engine is misfiring, and a trouble code will be stored.The most common code you will see is the P0300 code, along with a code like P030X. The X is replaced with the cylinder number where the cylinder misfire occurs; for example P0301 is a cylinder 1 misfire."
What Are The Causes Of An Engine Misfire?	"The most common causes of engine misfires are bad ignition coils or failed spark plugs. It can also be caused by fuel-related issues such as a faulty fuel injector or a bad fuel pump. In rare cases, it can also happen because of low engine compression.Here is a more detailed list of the most common cause of engine misfires:1. Bad Ignition CoilThree Ignition Coils VagThe most common cause of an engine misfire is a bad or failing ignition coil. Some vehicles have a separate ignition coil on every spark plug, while some cars have one coil pack with an ignition wire to each spark plug.Older cars use a distributor to distribute the spark to all the spark plugs, which are powered by an ignition coil. If either the distributor or the ignition coil creates a weak spark, it can cause misfires.2. Failed Spark PlugSpark PlugThe second most common cause of a misfiring engine is bad or failing spark plugs. The function of the spark plug is to ignite the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber, and if there is something wrong with the spark plug, it will not ignite, and a misfire will occur.Spark plugs should be replaced on a schedule for all car models, and not replacing them on time can cause fouled spark plugs, which can cause misfires. If you don?t know when you last changed the spark plugs, you need to check your service manual and replace them if necessary.3. Intake Manifold Gasket LeaksBad Intake Manifold GasketThere is a gasket located between the cylinder head and the intake manifold called the intake manifold gasket. If this gasket leaks, it will draw air into the combustion chamber, causing the air-fuel mixture to become too lean, and this can cause misfires.There are also many vacuum lines on the intake manifold that can leak, giving the same symptoms as a bad intake manifold gasket. However, finding these vacuum leaks is often quite easy and we will talk about that further down in the article.RELATED: 5 Signs of a Bad Intake Manifold Gasket (& Replacement Cost)4. Low Fuel PressureLow Fuel PressureLow fuel pressure is another thing that can cause misfires. Low fuel pressure causes less fuel to enter the engine?s combustion chambers, resulting in a lean air-fuel mixture that can cause misfires on all cylinders. Low fuel pressure can be caused by a faulty fuel pressure regulator, a faulty fuel pump, or a clogged fuel filter.Fortunately, checking the fuel pressure in your car is fairly easy with a manual fuel pressure gauge, and worth doing if you suspect low fuel pressure.5. Faulty InjectorFuel Injector SprayThe fuel injectors supply the combustion chamber with the correct amount of fuel for each cylinder, and there is usually a separate fuel injector for each cylinder. If the fuel injector injects the wrong amount of fuel, it will cause the engine to run rich or lean, which can lead to engine misfires.Failed injectors aren?t very common on most modern car models, and because of this, you?ll want to check out the other possible causes first. If you can?t find the issue elsewhere, it?s definitely worth taking a look at your fuel injectors.Read more: 8 Symptoms of a Bad Fuel Injector (& Replacement Cost)6. Bad Engine SensorCar Engine SensorsThe engine in modern cars uses many sensors to measure everything in the engine to make them as efficient as possible. Failure of any of these sensors can cause an incorrect air-fuel mixture to enter the engine, which can cause the engine to misfire.The most common car sensors that cause an incorrect air-fuel mixture are the MAF sensor, the MAP sensor, the oxygen sensor, and the coolant temperature sensor.7. Low CompressionCar Compression TestAs we talked about earlier, the engine needs the right air-fuel mixture, spark, and compression to fire properly. If you already checked the fuel supply and the spark and couldn?t find any problems with it, there is a risk of low compression in your engine.To find out if your engine has low compression, you need to do a compression test and compare the results to the manufacturer?s specifications. Unfortunately, low compression problems are often caused by worn parts inside the engine, which can be very expensive to fix, so you?ll want to inspect the other possible causes first."
What Are The Symptoms Of Engine Misfires?	"The main symptoms of an engine misfire include:Rough AccelerationRough IdleVibrationsCheck Engine LightEngine Sound ChangedHere is a more detailed list of the most common signs of engine misfires:1. Rough AccelerationWhen an engine misfire occurs, you may feel a strong or light jerk coming from the engine. These misfires often occur under load from the engine, such as when you accelerate quickly.The most common situation where you will feel misfires is in high gear, low RPM, and with the gas pedal to the floor. Rough acceleration is a typical sign that your engine is misfiring.You may also notice other performance issues, like slower acceleration than usual or a stalling engine while accelerating.2. Rough IdleThe car engine is most sensitive to small air-fuel mixture problems at idle, so this is probably one of the first places you will notice misfires.Therefore, if you notice that your car engine idles rougher than usual, it could be a sign of a misfiring engine. You may also notice problems such as the engine stalling at idle or an uneven idle that jumps up and down.3. VibrationsA car engine is very balanced when it is manufactured and often has balance shafts and various tricks to get as little vibration out of it as possible.When one or more cylinders do not fire properly, the engine will become unbalanced, and this can cause severe vibrations inside your car when accelerating or idling. You can also open the hood of your car and watch the engine idle. If you notice that it vibrates more than usual, it could be a sign that the engine is misfiring.4. Check Engine LightModern cars have good monitoring systems for all the different car sensors on the engine. If a sensor is failing or a sensor detects that something is wrong with the engine, it sends the information to the engine control module.When the engine control module receives the data, it will determine if the problem is serious or not. If the problem occurs repeatedly, the engine control module will illuminate the check engine light to let you know that something is wrong so that you can have it repaired.If you see a blinking or flashing check engine light, that?s another strong sign that your engine is misfiring.5. Engine Sound ChangedIf you know a little about cars, you?ve probably noticed a difference in sounds from different engines. V8 engines have a completely different tone than a four-cylinder engine, for example.Therefore, if your 4-cylinder engine misfires on one cylinder, it will sound like a 3-cylinder engine. If your car engine sounds unusual, it?s possible that your engine is misfiring on every cycle."
How To Fix Engine Misfires?	"To fix engine misfires, you need to read the trouble codes from the engine control module and continue troubleshooting from there. You?ll also want to inspect the spark plugs and ignition coils. Then, you want to look for vacuum leaks and cylinder compression.Here is a more detailed list of how to diagnose and fix engine misfires: 1. Check Trouble CodesModern car engines have a system that monitors all the sensors in the car engine, and if there is something wrong with a sensor, it will store it as a trouble code in the engine control module.Therefore, the first thing you want to do when diagnosing misfires is to check the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner. You can either get one yourself, or go to a mechanic and borrow their diagnostic tool to read the trouble codes from the ECM.This will give you important information. For example, if you see a trouble code like P0300 or P030X, it means that the ECM is detecting a misfire on a specific cylinder, and you may want to start checking the spark plug or ignition coil on that cylinder.If you find trouble codes on an engine sensor or low fuel pressure, you?ll want to start the diagnosis from there. It is important to start by reading the error codes to know where to start troubleshooting.2. Check Spark Plugs and CoilsIf you have a misfire trouble code on a specific cylinder, you?ll want to start by looking at the spark plugs and ignition coil on that cylinder. Remove the spark plug and ignition coil from that cylinder and visually inspect them and replace them if they look bad or dirty.An old trick that mechanics often use on car engines with separate ignition coils is to switch the spark plug and ignition coil to another cylinder. Then, clear the codes and drive for a while to see if the problem has moved to another cylinder. If it did, you know it?s a problem with either the spark plugs or the ignition coil, and you will want to replace all the spark plugs and the ignition coil on that cylinder.3. Check vacuum leaksIf you can?t find any problems on the spark side, it?s time to look at the air-fuel mixture. Vacuum leaks are a common cause of an incorrect air-fuel mixture and are fairly easy to check, so you want to start there.You can check for vacuum leaks by gently spraying a flammable spray around the engine?s intake manifold while the engine is idling. If the engine speed increases, it means there is a leak and the engine is injecting the flammable spray. However, be very careful when doing this and have a fire extinguisher ready.You can also use an EVAP smoke machine to easily find vacuum leaks, but these are often quite expensive and probably not something most people have in their garages.Learn more here: How to find a Vacuum Leak & How to Fix It (8 Easy Steps)4. Check fuel pressureThe next thing you want to check is the fuel pressure. Although most modern cars use an electric fuel pressure sensor, you?ll want to confirm the results with a manual fuel pressure gauge, because an electronic sensor can fail.Connect a fuel pressure gauge to the fuel rail and start the engine. Check the fuel pressure and compare it to the manufacturer?s specifications. If it is too high or too low, you need to inspect the components of the fuel system such as the fuel pump, fuel filter, and fuel pressure regulator.5. Check CompressionYou also want to ensure that the engine?s compression is correct, so you must do a compression test on all cylinders. You can do this with either a compression tester or a leak-down tester.Compare the results with the manufacturer?s specifications, and if the compression is low on a cylinder, you need to inspect the engine parts such as the timing belt, piston rings, valves, or pistons. All of these parts are often very expensive to replace, so you want to make sure you do a proper diagnosis before replacing them.6. Take it to a mechanicIf you?ve checked all the things above, but still can?t figure out what?s causing the misfires in your engine, it might be worth taking the car to a professional mechanic instead. Engine misfires can actually be quite difficult to diagnose even for us experts in the field.Even if you think it will be very expensive to take the car to a mechanic, it can actually sometimes be cheaper to get a proper diagnosis rather than replacing fully functional parts."
Is Engine Misfire Serious?	"Yes. Engine misfires are serious. When an engine misfires, it can cause reduced fuel economy, engine damage, and a loss of power. In some cases, it can also lead to dangerous situations where the car stalls and becomes difficult to steer due to the loss of power steering. It can also seriously damage your engine."
What Does An Engine Misfire Feel Like?	"If your engine misfires, it will feel like the engine is shaking or vibrating, and it may make a knocking noise. You may also notice that the engine does not sound like it used to, and that your car has reduced power and fuel efficiency. If you think you may have a problem with engine misfires, the best thing to do is take it to a mechanic to have it checked out."
How Much Does It Cost to Fix Engine Misfires?	"You can expect a cost of $200 to $500 to fix a misfiring engine in most cases. However, it depends on how serious the fault is and what specific repairs need to be made. Some of the most common causes of engine misfires are bad spark plugs or a bad ignition coil, which can be relatively cheap to repair. If you?re unlucky, it could be due to poor compression, which can be very expensive to repair."
How long can I drive with a misfiring engine?	"It is not recommended to drive your car at all with a misfiring car engine. If you suspect that your engine is misfiring, it is important to take care of the problem as soon as possible. Continuing to drive with a misfiring engine can cause serious damage to your car?s engine."
Can I drive with a misfiring engine?	"No. It?s not recommended to drive with engine misfires. Misfires can cause serious damage to your engine?s internal parts and the catalytic converter, which can be very costly to repair. It?s best to diagnose and repair the issue as soon as possible."
Conclusion	"A misfiring engine can be a serious problem that should be fixed as soon as possible. By understanding the causes, symptoms, and how to fix it, you can keep your car running smoothly and avoid expensive repair costs.Fixing a misfiring engine can sometimes be difficult without the right knowledge and tools, due to the multitude of possible causes. Therefore, if you have checked the basics, it may be worth taking your car to a qualified mechanic for expert advice.I hope you enjoyed this article and now have the expertise to diagnose engine problems like misfires and fix the problem with your car yourself to save some money."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Fuel Pressure Regulator ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad fuel pressure regulator are a misfiring engine and a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice issues like decreased engine performance, fuel leakage, and black smoke coming from the exhaust pipe.Here is a more detailed list of the most common signs of a bad fuel pressure regulator to look for:1. Engine MisfiresCar MisfiresOne of the most common symptoms you will notice when your fuel pressure regulator is bad is that your engine will misfire on idle or during acceleration.Fortunately, misfires are fairly easy to spot. If you hear the engine sputtering or not sounding like normal when you accelerate, you could be hearing a misfiring engine.However, misfires can also be caused by a lot of other things, so you shouldn?t just replace the fuel regulator as soon as you notice misfires. You need to make a proper diagnosis first.2. Loss in AccelerationCar AccelerationThe fuel regulator controls the fuel pressure, and if the fuel pressure is incorrect, the engine?s fuel pressure will be too high or too low. An incorrect fuel pressure causes the air-fuel ratio in your car engine to be either too rich or too lean, depending on the pressure.The engine needs a correct air-fuel mixture to function properly. Both too lean and too rich air-fuel mixture will cause a drop in acceleration. Therefore, if your car feels slower than before, it could be a problem with the fuel pressure regulator.3. Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light On Dashboard E1609869927250Almost all modern cars use a full-time monitoring system to monitor the car engine?s sensors constantly. If one of these sensors fails, a trouble code will be stored in the engine control module?s trouble code memory, and if this happens repeatedly, the check engine light will appear on your dashboard.Most car models have a fuel pressure sensor that controls the fuel pressure in the fuel rail. If the fuel regulator is broken and the fuel pressure becomes too high or too low, the check engine light will appear on your dashboard.4. Fuel LeakageFuel LeakAnother common symptom when the fuel pressure regulator goes bad is fuel leakage, which causes performance problems and leads to bad smells. A fuel leak occurs when the fuel regulator diaphragm or outer seal is damaged and broken.Fuel leaks are also very dangerous, as they can cause your car to catch fire. If you have a fuel leak, you should attend to it immediately.5. Black Smoke from the Exhaust PipeBlack Smoke From ExhaustMany people think that only diesel engines will get black smoke from the exhaust, but it can actually happen to gasoline engines too if the air-fuel mixture is too rich. As we discussed earlier, a bad fuel pressure regulator can cause a rich air-fuel mixture. This means that black smoke from the exhaust can be a sign of a bad fuel pressure regulator.Black smoke coming out of your car?s exhaust can have various other causes, but if you see black or gray color exhaust smoke and also notice other symptoms mentioned in this article, the problem is very likely with the fuel regulator.6. Spark Plug Covered with Black DebrisSooty Spark PlugIf your engine is running too rich as a result of a faulty fuel pressure regulator, there is a significant risk of your combustion chamber becoming full of soot.If you are about to change the spark plugs and notice that the end of the spark plugs are completely black and full of soot, it is a sign that your engine is running rich. It is also a sign that the fuel pressure regulator is bad, and you may need to replace both the fuel pressure regulator and the spark plugs.7. Engine BackfiresBackfireA faulty fuel pressure regulator will cause excess fuel to flow through the combustion chamber. The engine will not be able to burn it all, and the exhaust system will be overfilled with fuel.The fuel will then flow into a hot exhaust system, which will ignite and cause an explosion of all the unburnt fuel in the exhaust system. This is quite dangerous. It can cause your exhaust pipe to explode and your car to catch fire. Therefore, it is important to get it fixed as soon as possible.8. Vacuum Hose filled with gasolineCar Vacuum HoseA defective fuel pressure regulator diaphragm can cause fuel pressure to enter the vacuum system instead of the engine. This will cause the vacuum hoses and the intake manifold to become filled with gasoline.To check this, remove the vacuum hose connection to the fuel pressure regulator and check for gasoline in the line. If so, you most likely have a faulty fuel pressure regulator.9. Gasoline Smell from the DipstickEngine Oil DipstickAs we discussed earlier, a bad fuel pressure regulator can cause the engine to run rich. Also, an engine that runs rich for a long time will cause unburned fuel to flow into the oil pan and fill it with gasoline.To check this, you have to lift the engine oil dipstick and check the oil level, and if you can smell or can see gasoline on the dipstick, it can mean that your fuel pressure regulator has a problem.10. Drop in MileageBad Fuel ConsumptionImproper fuel pressure can not only cause a rich mixture, but it can also cause a lean air-fuel mixture. While you may think that a drop in mileage might be helpful, it can actually seriously damage your car engine over time.A lean mixture will often cause your car to drop in acceleration as well, but you might only notice a drop in mileage."
Fuel Pressure Regulator Location ?	"The most common location for the fuel pressure regulator is at one end of the fuel rail, which is usually located under or near the intake manifold. However, the location varies depending on the car model; some may even have it in the fuel tank.If you know where the fuel injectors are in your car, you?ll want to look there. Both the fuel injectors and the fuel pressure regulator are usually attached to the fuel rail."
How to Test a Fuel Pressure Regulator?	"The best way to check a fuel pressure regulator?s function is with a fuel pressure gauge and disconnect the vacuum hose. This test verifies that the fuel pressure regulator is properly regulating fuel pressure in accordance with engine vacuum changes.Let the engine run with the fuel pressure gauge connected and disconnect the vacuum hose from the regulator. With the hose disconnected, the fuel system pressure should increase by 8 to 10 psi. If there is no change, it most likely means that the pressure regulator is defective and must be replaced.You should also check that the pressure is within the manufacturer?s specifications. You can usually find these in a repair manual for your car.On newer vehicles, the fuel pressure regulator can be easily checked with an OBD2 scanner at any garage or at home, but it?s always a good idea to check it manually as well, as there is always a risk that the fuel pressure sensor is showing an incorrect pressure."
Fuel Pressure Regulator Replacement Cost ?	"The average fuel pressure regulator replacement cost is between $80 and $500, depending on the car model and labor costs. A fuel pressure regulator costs $30 to $200, and the average labor cost is $50 to $300.However, if you choose to replace it yourself instead of having a mechanic do it, you can save on the labor cost, making it cheaper.In some car models, you cannot replace the fuel pressure regulator alone. You may need to replace the entire fuel pressure rail. Also, if you have a V engine, you may have more than one fuel pressure regulator, which will double the cost of replacing the system.In some car models, the fuel pressure regulator is located near the fuel pump in the fuel tank, making it much more difficult and expensive to replace."
A Mechanic?s Tips about Fuel Pressure Regulator Replacement	"My first recommendation is always to make sure you get new bolts and gaskets when buying a new fuel pressure regulator.It is recommended to replace the hose clamps for the fuel lines and the vacuum hose when replacing the fuel pressure regulator.It?s not very common for the fuel pressure regulator to fail, so I highly recommend checking the vacuum line to the fuel pressure regulator before replacing it. It is also much more likely that there is a problem with your fuel pump or fuel filter.Check the fuel pressure with a manual fuel pressure gauge connected to the fuel rail, and remove the vacuum hose while the engine is idling. If the fuel pressure is moving and within the correct specifications, the fuel pressure regulator is most likely OK.Working with different types of fuel is very toxic to your body. Always use the right safety equipment for the job.Check in the vacuum hose connection on the fuel pressure regulator to see if you can see any fuel there. If there is fuel inside it, the diaphragm inside the fuel pressure regulator is broken.In some fuel pressure regulators, you can replace the diaphragm inside, making the part much cheaper. However, this mostly applies to older cars."
How Does a Fuel Pressure Regulator Work?	"The fuel pressure regulator contains a spring that presses against a diaphragm. There is also a vacuum hose connected to the regulator and when the vacuum rises, it causes the diaphragm to push against the spring. This reduces the fuel pressure and also the amount of fuel injected into the engine. As the pressure drops, it increases the fuel pressure."
How to Clean a Fuel Pressure Regulator?	"Cleaning a fuel pressure regulator will not fix it in most cases. However, if you want to clean the fuel pressure regulator, you can remove the fuel and vacuum lines and remove the regulator. You can then use rubbing alcohol and blow it dry with compressed air."
How Do You Fix a Fuel Pressure Regulator?	"Most modern fuel regulators are closed units and cannot be fixed. In some older fuel pressure regulators, you can replace the diaphragm inside of it, but this is not as common on modern car models. However, nowadays fuel pressure regulators are often quite cheap and in most cases not worth taking apart."
What Does a Fuel Pressure Regulator Do?	"The fuel pressure regulator does exactly what it sounds like ? it regulates the fuel pressure in the fuel rail by using the pressure from the intake manifold. Higher fuel pressure will result in a richer fuel mixture, and lower pressure will result in a leaner mixture. It increases the pressure at higher rpm and lowers the fuel pressure at idle."
How do I Adjust my Fuel Pressure Regulator?	"Most modern fuel pressure regulators are not adjustable, so if it is worn and results in incorrect fuel pressure, you will need to replace the regulator instead. However, some older fuel pressure regulators have an adjustment screw on top of the regulator that you can use to adjust the pressure."
Can a Bad Fuel Pressure Regulator Cause No Start?	"Yes. A bad fuel pressure regulator can result in very low fuel pressure, causing little or no fuel to enter the engine, which in turn causes the engine to have trouble starting. Also, if an internal leak fills the vacuum lines with fuel, it can flood the engine and cause it to not start."
When Should a Fuel Pressure Regulator Be Replaced?	There is no set schedule for when you need to replace the fuel pressure regulator. A fuel regulator can often easily last the life of the car; it?s not very common for the fuel pressure regulator to break on most car models.
How Serious is a Fuel Pressure Regulator Failure?	"A failed fuel pressure regulator can cause your car engine to stop immediately, causing accidents if it happens at the wrong moment. It can also cause an engine fire if it?s leaking externally, and therefore we recommend to replace"
Conclusion	"A bad fuel pressure regulator can cause a number of symptoms that will affect your car?s performance. If you experience several of these problems above, it?s probably time for a replacement. However, a proper diagnosis before replacing parts will save you a lot of money.The first thing you need to do before replacing the fuel pressure regulator is to find out where your fuel pressure regulator is located. In some car models, it is located in the fuel tank, and this makes the whole process much more difficult and expensive.I hope you enjoyed this article and now have the knowledge to determine if your fuel pressure regulator is bad, and also that you know all you need to know about replacement costs."
How Much Does a Car Engine Replacement Cost?	"On average, you can expect to spend anywhere from $1,500 to $7,500 for a typical car engine replacement, depending on what type of car you drive. Additionally, factors such as the labor rate, type of engine being replaced and the other parts that are needed will all affect the total cost. If your engine has failed, you might be wondering if it?s worth replacing. As you look at the cost, you might consider purchasing another vehicle instead, which is a logical solution for some. There are several considerations to think about before you decide. "
Should I Pay to Have a Car Engine Replaced?	"For starters, how long are you planning to keep the vehicle? If other parts are failing and it?s costing you a lot to repair, it might be time to jump ship and cut your losses. On the other hand, if everything has been running well and you are confident the car can provide many more miles of service, an engine replacement could be looked at as an investment.You must also consider the worth of your car. If your vehicle is worth $2,500, but the engine replacement is going to cost $5,000, you may decide to purchase something else instead. This car might be better served as a parts vehicle or maybe it needs to take up a spot in the junkyard for other people to benefit from."
Factors Affecting Cost of Replacing a Car Engine ?	"1. Engine SizeThe price you spend on the new engine is going to be dramatically impacted by how large the motor is. If you have a four-cylinder engine, the cost will usually be much lower than a large V8. As an example, you might spend $2,500 to get a four-cylinder, whereas you would quickly pay $4,000 or more for the eight-cylinder.As the engine size gets bigger, the operation is more complex. Creating these larger engines naturally means the price will be higher. RELATED: How Much Does A Car Engine Weigh? (Small or Large Engines)2. Type of EngineYou have multiple options when your engine fails. You don?t need to choose a brand-new engine, which will make the price higher than any other option.There?s also the choice to choose a remanufactured or rebuilt engine, as well as a used motor. We discuss more about these options down below. 3. Labor RatePutting an engine in is a tough job. Not every mechanic is willing to take on this task. However, when you find someone that is, you can expect that they are going to charge you a premium price for the hassle.On average, an engine replacement can take 4 to 16 hours, depending on the complexity. You should be prepared to receive a charge for this long or longer, at whatever the current rate is. On average, labor rates are anywhere from $90 to $250 per hour, which can change widely depending on where you live in the nation. With this in mind, between $360 and $4,000 of the bill accounts for labor charges. 4. Additional PartsThere?s more that?s involved in the engine replacement than simply the motor. All of the bolts and connecting parts will also need inspection and replacement when worn. You might need a new belt, hose, pulley or pump. With each of these additional parts, the price is going to jump higher.Not only will the parts add more to the bill, but the additional labor has to go up in conjunction. Plus, you must factor in the consumables used, such as new motor oil. 5. WarrantySome shops won?t offer a warranty with the engine replacement. While you could pay less to visit this shop, you might not be willing to throw the money away on the repair. In these situations, you might want to pay a little more to get a guarantee.The powertrain warranty doesn?t need to last long. But, you want to be able to drive away with peace of mind that there?s some recourse if there?s a defect. "
Engine Replacement Types ?	"1. Brand-New New engines have zero miles on them because they have come directly from the manufacturer. You may have heard of the new engine being called a crate engine too. These are the most expensive option you can choose from. In many cases, the new engine can cost more than the vehicle is worth. However, you know that the engine will be in the best condition possible. 2. Reconditioned/RemanufacturedThe second best option compared to the new engine is the reconditioned or remanufactured motor. During this extensive process, the engine is brought back to like-new condition, ensuring it satisfies all of the standards set out by the manufacturer. To complete this process, the entire engine must first be disassembled, so new components can be installed. It is also cleaned out well and must pass several rigorous tests before it can be considered good enough. Plus, the majority of these engines come with some type of warranty protection, although it won?t be as good as the new engine would. 3. RebuiltWith the rebuilt engine, there?s been a partial reconstruction of the motor, but it?s not performed to the reconditioned status. Part of the engine is disassembled, but only damaged or worn parts are going to be replaced. Still, the engine is going to be in better shape than the typical used motor.Many mechanics will rebuild the car engine for a fee. The job that?s performed will directly correlate to how much work the mechanic is willing to put into it and how much you are willing to pay. The more experienced the mechanic is, the better the job will be. However, it?s difficult to get warranty coverage on the average rebuilt engine, but it?s still cheaper than the other two options we?ve already talked about.4. UsedThe used motor is the one that comes out of another car and is put under the hood of yours. Most of these come from the salvage yard from a vehicle that houses the same engine. The junkyard will carefully remove it and sell it to you without any testing or guarantees. If you can find a yard that does test the engine or warranty it for some period, you will spend more.When you purchase a vehicle from the salvage yard, find out what components come with it. Some yards offer components, such as the manifold, which helps you save money on new parts. Because you should already replace some other parts with your engine, it?s beneficial to get them as a package deal. "
How to Prevent Engine Replacement?	"There?s only one way to prevent an engine replacement in your car. You must take care of your vehicle and provide all of the recommended maintenance when it is due. With the regular oil change and periodic tune-ups, you ensure that the engine is always running as it should, allowing for less wear and tear.Additionally, it helps to treat your engine with respect. You shouldn?t push the engine to work harder or do more than what it?s capable of. Being light on the gas pedal and treating the vehicle with care will help the engine to last as long as possible.Finally, it?s important to think about what car engine you are using. Before you buy a car, it?s best to do some research because many cars have defective engines under the hood right out of the gate. For example, in 2016, Subaru issued reimbursement to owners of 2.0- and 2.5-liter naturally aspirated engines because they guzzled oil and led to premature failure. If you purchase a used car with a reliable engine, you have a better chance of getting your mileage out of it."
How Can I Pay For An Engine Replacement?	"1. CashIdeally, you would want to pay for the engine replacement out of pocket with money you?ve saved up. If you are putting a small amount of money away each month, you will be prepared for this unexpected expense. With a cash payment, you don?t need to worry about paying any interest. You also don?t need to wrestle with claims through a warranty company. 2. Credit CardIf you don?t have the cash or you prefer to rack up points on a credit card, you might choose this option instead. With a credit card, you can make monthly payments to cover the bill, thereby reducing the burden you feel all at once.However, this option does lead to some interest charges. In the long run, you will spend more on the engine replacement than you would have if you had paid in cash. 3. LoanIf you have good credit, you might choose to take out a personal loan for the car repairs. The better your credit score is, the lower your interest rate will also be. You can also get a higher payout amount.However, there will also be interest payments required, thereby causing a higher total in the end. Sometimes, these interest rates are higher than what?s found on your credit card, so compare the two before making the decision. Warranty/Service ContractIf you drive a new car or a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle, it might still be covered by the factory warranty. If that?s the case, let the manufacturer foot the bill for the engine replacement. Even if there isn?t a factory warranty, you may still be signed up with a third-party company. With simple powertrain coverage, you could get a replacement engine. On the flip side, there might be a deductible payment you will be responsible for and you will have to handle the claims process. You may even have to put the money out of pocket and have the provider reimburse you. "
Does a new engine mean new mileage?	"No, a new car engine does not reset the odometer or your car?s mileage. The odometer is not connected to your engine, it is connected and calculated by the wheel speed. But an engine with less mileage can still be attractive to buyers."
How long does it take to replace a car engine?	"It takes anywhere between 4 and 16 hours on average to replace a car engine, depending on the car model and engine type. In general, the older the car, the faster it is to replace the engine. Modern car engines have many more parts than older engines that need to be removed."
Is it worth replacing a car?s engine?	"Whether or not it is worth replacing a car engine depends on the value of the car and the price of the engine. For example, if the cost of the engine is much higher than the value of the car, it may be worth looking at another car instead."
Is it better to replace or repair an engine?	"Finding a replacement motor can be a good idea if you can find one at a good price. Repairing an engine can be time-consuming, which will result in high labor costs, but this depends on the severity of the engine damage. However, for some cars there are no cheap replacement engines, and in that case it may be more worthwhile to repair it."
Conclusion 	"Having to replace a car engine is never a fun experience, as it is usually very expensive. The only way you can try to prevent this type of engine replacement is to make sure you always maintain the engine according to the service schedule. Although it seems expensive to maintain it so much, it will be even more expensive to replace the engine.I hope you enjoyed the article and now have all knowledge you need about engine replacement costs."
What is an EGR Delete?	"The EGR delete simply means that the vehicle?s exhaust gas recirculation system has been removed to make room for an aftermarket kit. The EGR valve gets removed, so exhaust gases get re-routed from the engine. Typically, these exhaust gases would be used in the engine for further combustion. When you do an EGR delete, you remove the EGR valve and replace it with a part that blocks the EGR passages. If you have a modern car, you will also need to reprogram the ECM software to work without the EGR system.When considering whether to perform an EGR delete, there are several advantages that make it appealing. However, there are also plenty of disadvantages that must be considered before determining whether this is the right path. "
EGR Delete Pros 	"1. Increased HorsepowerWhen you remove the EGR system from a car, the engine?s air-fuel mixture gets a big boost in oxygen density. In many engine types, this boost is only going to increase the horsepower noticed from the motor. To get the most boost, an EGR delete should be done on an older vehicle. These models have fewer sensors and systems set up to regulate what happens during an imbalance. We will discuss what happens with newer cars in a minute. 2. Better Fuel EconomyThe purpose of the EGR system is to redirect exhaust gases back into the engine to be reused. However, this system isn?t always the most efficient option.In some cases, sending the exhaust gas away from the engine can prove to be more valuable. With the right aftermarket kit installed, you could see a small boost to the fuel economy, thereby helping you save money at the pump. 3. Reduces Engine TemperatureEGR valves are known to hold a lot of soot. If the coolers or valves become clogged, the exhaust gases find a way around, thereby leading to a blockage. Because of this problem, temperatures in the motor naturally begin to rise and you could notice a lack of power.However, when the EGR system is bypassed, there is less soot buildup. Your engine will run at normal temperatures and you no longer have to worry about clogs. 4. Boosts Engine LifeWith the EGR delete re-routing the exhaust gas away from the engine, everything starts to run a little cleaner. You notice a jump in efficiency and the temperatures remain normal. Because of these two perks alone, you can expect a longer engine life overall. Without clogs and soot buildup, there?s less to go wrong with the motor, thereby ensuring you can drive more miles. 5. Fewer RepairsIt isn?t just the optimized motor that keeps more money in your pocket. Without the EGR valve intact, you have fewer repairs to worry about.When the EGR system becomes damaged or defective, you could look at a hefty repair bill. Without it, there?s nothing to budget for.  "
EGR Delete Cons	"1. Bad For the EnvironmentThe whole purpose of the EGR valve is to recirculate some of the exhaust gases back into the engine again for another combustion. This is to reduce emissions from the engine and ensure the car will pass all emission tests.If you remove the EGR system, it?s therefore also quite obvious that it will be bad for the environment when the exhaust gases are not reused. If you have a yearly smoke test where you live, you can also run into problems if you removed the EGR system and your car may not pass the smoke check.This will also cause you to run into some legal issues when doing an EGR delete, which we will discuss a little further down in the article.2. Possibly Reduced HorsepowerThe EGR delete kit works much better with an older diesel motor. In the older generations, the engines have a flaw, allowing for a bypassed route to supply cleaner air to the mixture. This cleaner air allows for more horsepower.However, the modern motor isn?t always going to have the same benefits. Using an EGR delete kit on one of the diesel motors might actually provide a reduction in horsepower because it?s not designed to work that way.To ensure that your engine will not lose horsepower, you need to install a good EGR delete software after you remove the EGR valve.3. Louder PerformanceThis could be seen as a benefit or disadvantage, depending on how you look at it. When you perform an exhaust gas recirculation system delete, the sound of the engine can appear slightly louder on idle.This is because the EGR system minimizes the noise coming out of the engine when it recirculates a portion of the exhaust gases. However, this slight increase in noise at idle will not be noticeable on most car models, but you should still be aware of it.4. Engine KnockingThe car engine is meant to work as it was designed. When you take off valuable parts or re-route any aspect of the system, there?s always a chance for disaster to strike.As one example, it?s possible for the engine to start knocking once you perform an EGR delete without the right software for your car. To fix this, you might need to reinstall the EGR system back to factory specifications or install a new software made for an EGR delete. Otherwise, you could be allowing permanent damage to the engine, which is costly to repair. "
Is the EGR Delete Legal?	"It?s illegal to delete the car?s exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system in all fifty states. Across the US, there are laws in place that are meant to be the standard for road vehicles. One of the main requirements for a vehicle to be registered for road use is that it has a functional EGR system.If not, it shouldn?t be driven on the streets. The government enacts these laws to ensure the country and environment are all adequately protected. For the same reason, most aspects of the car emission system are not to be tampered with. While these laws won?t stop you from finding someone to help with an EGR delete, you should consider what you are doing before moving forward. If you proceed with the EGR delete, you could face fines if you are caught. It could also be difficult to pass a vehicle inspection, depending on how strict your state is. Beyond that, it?s not legal to sell a vehicle in most states if you?ve tampered with the emissions systems."
How Much Does An EGR Delete Cost?	"On average, you can expect to spend $100 to $1000 for an EGR delete. Of course, this cost has several factors involved that make a big difference. Obviously, the type of vehicle you are driving matters. It also depends on which type of software you are going to use.Usually, the parts for an EGR delete will be very cheap, as you usually only need a piece of metal to block the EGR passages when you remove the EGR valve. You can also do this part yourself at home with a few basic tools, depending on the car model.The costly or difficult part comes when you need a software to compensate for the EGR removal if you have a modern car. With a few basic diagnostic tools, you can download a ready-made EGR removal software online for your car model. However, this is risky, and you can burn your ECM.Therefore, it?s often a good idea to let a professional tuner make a custom EGR delete software for you. This can cost anywhere between $100 to $1000 depending on where you decide to get the software done."
Does an EGR delete need a tune?	"Yes, if you have a modern car, you need to tune the software after removing the EGR valve. There is either ready-made software you can download to your vehicle, which can be risky. Therefore, it is recommended to have a professional tuner remove the EGR function from your car?s software."
Is it good to delete EGR?	"Removing EGR may be good for the engine?s health, but it will be bad for the environment. EGR recirculates the exhaust to ensure that fewer emissions will leave the engine, and if you remove the EGR, those emissions will flow out."
Will an EGR delete cause black smoke?	"Removing the EGR can definitely cause your car to create more black smoke. This is especially true if you haven?t installed a good EGR removal software or haven?t upgraded the software at all. However, this is much more common with diesel engines."
Can an EGR delete damage the engine?	"Yes, removing the EGR without installing good software for your engine control module can lead to engine damage. This is especially true if you install software downloaded from a random internet forum, which can do more harm than good."
Conclusion 	"Although EGR removals are healthy for most car engines and will extend the life of the engine, you should remember that they are done to save our environment. Therefore, it is important to look at both the pros and cons before choosing to remove your EGR valve.I hope this article helped you with your EGR removal decision and that you now have the knowledge to understand what will happen when you remove it."
What Are Spoon Engines?	"The Spoon engine is a motor that?s been specifically modified to increase circuit racing potential. It utilizes unique Spoon parts, all of which are created with an extremely low margin of error because of the high-tech precision. Refining and balancing are all part of creating a high-performance engine.In the Spoon engine, multiple parts are refined and balanced. These parts include the driveshaft, brakes, throttle body, head gasket, aerodynamic components and gusset plates. With the Spoon engine, the car can hit 11,000 RPMs while competing in a high-speed race. "
Benefits of Spoon Engines	"1. Increased PowerThe main purpose of having a Spoon engine is for the boost in power. Typical cars suffer on some level from inefficiency, loss of power and a delay in delivery. However, that?s not the case with the Spoon engine.Once the tuning has been completed, the new engine revs much faster, without delay. It also can hit higher RPMs to produce even more power. 2. Improves ReliabilityBy refining the engine, reliability is also increased. Any weakness that previously existed in the components is removed when it?s upgraded. Additionally, with the power optimized, the engine is meant to last longer. With all of the parts designed to go further, you have fewer repair bills to worry about. 3. Refined/Balanced PerformanceThe Spoon Engine is completely refined and balanced. With complete precision, the pistons and rods are rebalanced, thereby ensuring there?s no weight difference reaching over 0.01 grams. The engine also has the bolts torqued to 0.01 N/M of automaker specs. With a complete rebalancing, the reliability is improved a lot, and everything runs as efficiently as possible. "
Where Does the Spoon Engine Name Come From?	"Many people assume that the Spoon engine gets its name from some unique design or shape, but that?s not the truth. It?s only named this because it was designed by the Spoon Sports Company. This automaker creates high-tech motor parts that build a unique engine.The Spoon team hand-builds every engine. They are not created on an assembly line, so precision is heavily ensured. For this reason, the only engines that can be deemed Spoon motors must come from the company?s sports complex, located in Tokyo, Japan. When was Spoon Sports created? Tatsuru Ichishima was once a Honda test driver and he also raced cars. He started by helping to build economical cars that also have potent power for a unique driving experience. His first modification was to a 3rd-Gen Honda Civic Hatchback. He took apart the ZC 1.6-liter engine and boosted it to 230 horsepower. After that, he began racing the Spoon Civic models he created during the Japanese Touring Car Championship Circuit in the late 1980s.Honda was impressed so deeply by Ichishima?s achievements that the company authored an exclusive deal with him in 1989. That?s when he started the Spoon Sports Company. "
What Cars Can Get Spoon Engines?	"The spoon engine is modified from standard engines from Honda vehicles. Although there are a limited number of engines you can buy Spoon parts for, you can modify a Honda Spoon engine to fit any car, with varying amounts of work of course.The reason for this exclusivity to Honda is because of the Spoon Sports and Honda partnership. You can outfit many Honda cars with the Spoon engine, including some models of the following:Honda AccordHonda Acura IntegraHonda CivicHonda CR-ZHonda FitHonda N-OneHonda S2000Honda S660You can check the compatibility of your vehicle by reaching out to the company directly. "
Cost of Spoon Engine	"There are various motors available and the price will depend on what type of vehicle you are driving. However, as an average, we can look at the Spoon K20A engine, which seems to have a price tag of $10,000+, but that doesn?t include the shipping and handling fee. This sounds like a lot of money, but it?s worth every penny if you are a circuit racer. You can essentially pick up a junk Honda from the salvage yard for$1,000 or less. With this car, you can upgrade the engine, wheels, suspension and brakes to create a unique race car. With this simple investment, you could easily beat some of the most expensive cars on the race track. Not only that, but the car would be worth a lot of money when you are done with it. Enthusiasts are willing to spend a lot of money on Honda models with the Spoon engine installed. On the other hand, many people can find many other things worth spending $10,000 or more on. It would not only make a great investment on a daily driver, but it could be a hefty down payment on a home. For this reason alone, you don?t see a lot of Honda models with Spoon engines installed. "
differences between Mugen and Spoon Engines ?	"Many people ask for a comparison between Mugen vs Spoon Engines, even if they are not really comparable. Mugen is specialized in F1 and F3 racing cars, while Spoon is more for street racing and road racing cars.Mugen means ?unlimited,? ?vast? or ?without limit.? Many people replace the meaning to say ?unlimited power? instead. The company was founded by the son of the Honda creator. This rival company arrived about the same time as we first saw Spoon, so they have been battling it out for many years.If you talk to any enthusiast, they will have their preference. Some drivers prefer the power that comes from Spoon while leaning heavily toward the appearance and body kits provided by Mugen. For that reason, it?s important to do your own research based on your unique needs to figure out which one is best for you. Either way, you want to make sure you have plenty of money saved up before you start the modifications. Be prepared to also pay for any repairs that might come down the road."
How much HP does a Spoon engine have?	"There is no fixed amount of horsepower that every Spoon engine has, it all depends on the engine type and modifications. However, you can expect to get 250 to 500 hp when you buy a complete Spoon engine."
Does Spoon still make engines?	"Yes, you can still buy both Spoon engines and engine parts made by Spoon. If you are looking for an engine that is built to last, then Spoon is the company you can trust."
What car comes with a Spoon engine?	"No cars come with Spoon engines from the factory. However, Spoon engines are made for many Honda models so if you are looking for a powerful and reliable engine for your Honda, Spoon is an excellent choice to modify it with"
Are spoon engines any good?	"Spoon Engines are incredibly good if you are looking for a motor that has a lot of power and reliability. However, it may be a bit excessive for a regular street car. Overall, Spoon engines are an excellent choice for those looking for a powerful and efficient race car engine."
What Does it Mean When the Engine Runs Lean?	"If the engine runs lean, it isn?t getting enough fuel. To someone that doesn?t understand car engines, it might seem that this is a good thing ? maybe you?ll even save some money on gas! However, allowing the engine to run lean can lead to serious damage.When the engine doesn?t get the right amount of fuel, it has to work harder to perform. Left unchecked, the problems only get larger, eventually leading to irreparable engine damage."
what are the Causes Engine Running Lean  ?	"The most common reason why an engine is running lean is due to a clogged fuel filter, vacuum leak, failing fuel pump, or clogged fuel injectors. It can also be a faulty sensor like a bad O2 sensor or MAF sensor sending the wrong information to the ECU.Here is a more detailed list of the possible causes of the engine running lean:1. Clogged Fuel FilterThe fuel filter is responsible for removing contaminants and dirt from the gas. Over time, the grime and debris build up in the filter, eventually leading to a clog. If fuel can?t get through the filter, it won?t make its way to the engine. That?s why it?s important for you to change the fuel filter as part of your regular maintenance. RELATED: 5 Symptoms of a Clogged Fuel Filter (& Replacement Cost)2. Failing Fuel PumpThe fuel pump sits in the tank and it?s responsible for pushing the gas into the engine. If the pump fails to work, fuel cannot make its own way into the combustion chamber, causing the engine to run lean. Fuel pumps aren?t part of the regular maintenance, and can be difficult to replace. That?s why it?s important to keep your tank always more than ¬ full to ensure the pump gets the care it needs. 3. Clogged Fuel InjectorsIf you are regularly changing the fuel filter, the injectors are being cared for. However, when debris and contaminants get into the injectors, trouble is about to follow.Even the smallest bit of dirt can cause an injector to malfunction. You can try to use a fuel injector cleaner, but if that doesn?t work, it?s time for a replacement. This can be a hefty bill you don?t want to pay. 4. Bad O2 SensorThe oxygen sensors tell the ECU how much fuel needs to be added to create the perfect balance with air. However, when the sensors malfunction, the wrong information can be sent to the ECU.The ECU could trick the vehicle into sending too little fuel because of this faulty data. However, changing out the oxygen sensors is often a simple task. 5. Faulty MAF sensorThe MAF sensor is responsible for monitoring how much air enters the engine. This sensor also sends information to the computer so the right balance of fuel can be injected. For the same reasons, a faulty MAF can cause too little or too much fuel to enter the combustion chamber. When the balance of fuel is too low, the engine runs lean.6. Vacuum LeakIf your engine has a vacuum leak from the intake manifold, it will cause the air to enter the engine unmeasured by the MAF sensor, and this will cause the engine fuel mixture to become lean.It can also be leaks coming from the boost pipes, or anywhere between the MAF sensor and the engine intake. However, cracked vacuum hoses are the most common issue."
What Are The Symptoms Of An Engine Running Lean?	"The symptoms of a lean running engine include:Poor engine performanceStallingTrouble starting the engineContaminated spark plugsCheck engine lightHere is a more detailed list of the signs of a lean-running engine to look for:1. Poor engine performanceSlow Car AccelerationThe first sign that the engine is running lean shows itself in the everyday performance. There will be a significant drop in the power output of the engine, resulting in a reduction of acceleration.Fuel injectors must push enough fuel into the cylinder to ensure maximum power output. If there isn?t enough fuel getting to the cylinders, you will see issues with the responsiveness of the car. 2. Stalling Engine StallAs the problems get worse, you might have trouble keeping the engine running. It?s going to sputter and sound like it?s dying right before it stalls.In some cases, you may be able to step harder on the accelerator to force more fuel into the system. However, it?s only a matter of time before the vehicle leaves you stranded. 3. Trouble Starting EngineDifficulty Starting CarThe engine cannot run if the fuel is withheld. That?s precisely what happens when the engine runs lean. At first, you might notice the performance issues and stalling, but the trouble will get even worse.Eventually, the car won?t start at all. If you have been experiencing the other symptoms and it turns into having trouble getting the motor turned over, you might have a situation that?s causing it to run lean. 4. Contaminated Spark PlugsSpark Plug MisfiresMost people don?t examine the spark plugs, but if you did, you would notice they look different when the engine runs lean. Spark plugs are meant to get dirty and worn.If you pull one out and it looks brand new or white, it?s an indication that the engine isn?t getting enough fuel. In this case, clean-looking plugs aren?t a good thing. 5. Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light On Dashboard E1609869927250When the Check Engine Light comes on, you know something is wrong. However, it can be tough to discern the meaning because this light illuminates for hundreds of reasons. When the ECU senses that something is wrong, a trouble code is set and the light comes on. With a code scanner, you can determine if the problem is related to a lean-running engine or something else, so you can take quick action. "
Engine Running Lean Fixes ?	"Read Engine CodesIf the Check Engine Light is on, your first step should be to read the engine codes. With a professional code scanner, you might gain a better understanding of what?s going on.Hopefully, the code tells you exactly what part is defective. With that said, there?s always the chance that you will only see a generic ?Engine Running Lean? code, which doesn?t give you much insight.Replace Malfunctioning PartsOnce you?ve determined what the defective part is, you can repair it. There are some parts that can simply be cleaned, such as the injectors. By cleaning the injectors, you might save some money.Otherwise, the parts will need to be replaced. Some of these parts are cheaper than others. Plus, it?s easier to repair certain components than others. Evaluate whether you can accomplish the fix on your own before moving forward. Visit Local MechanicIf you don?t feel that you can repair the problem on your own, it?s best to visit a local shop. Do your research to find a trustworthy repair shop at a reasonable price.It?s also helpful to visit local mechanics if you are having trouble figuring out what?s going on. Instead of banging your head against the wall, let someone else perform the diagnosis. "
differences between Engine Running Lean and Rich ?	"I explained that a lean-running engine means it isn?t getting enough fuel. This means the combustion chamber contains too much air, creating an imbalance. The symptoms of this problem result in sluggish performance, stalling and even trouble to start the car. How is this different from when the engine runs rich? A rich-running engine means that too much fuel and not enough air are in the combustion chamber. In this case, you might be able to start the car, but will likely experience a decrease in fuel economy and a strong smell of gas. Over time, this problem will cause the catalytic converter to fail, which is an expensive repair. A dirty air filter is the most common cause of an engine running rich, and it is a simple thing to fix. In either situation, it?s best to repair the problem causing the imbalance right away. Otherwise, you may find yourself with more costly and troublesome issues down the road. "
Can I drive a car running lean?	"While you can most likely drive your car engine while running lean, it is definitely not recommended. A lean engine will create a lot of heat which can damage internal engine parts, especially at high loads on powerful engines."
Is it better to run lean or rich?	"For the engine, it is considered safer to run rich because of the speed at which a lean engine creates so much heat. A lean engine can also cause detonations which will cause damage to your internal engine parts, resulting in an expensive repair bill."
 Can bad spark plugs make an engine run lean?	"No. Bad spark plugs will not make your engine run lean. However, bad spark plugs can cause misfires that will fool the O2 sensor, which can create some weird fuel delivery issues."
What does spark plugs look like when running lean?	"A lean running engine causes the spark plug electrode to turn white. If it?s black, it?s rich or burning oil. If it is light brown, the air fuel mixture is perfect."
What is Sea Foam?	"Sea Foam is an additive that is meant to clean the fuel and engine of vehicles. It can be used to clean up the carburetor passages, intake valves and other vital components. It?s designed to remove carbon deposits that build up over time. Sea Foam can be used in both diesel and gas-powered engines. However, it?s not compatible with everything on the road.So what is Sea foam made of? The chemical composition of Sea Foam is mainly petroleum-based products. Some of the top ingredients include pale oil (40-60%), naphtha (25-35%) and isopropyl alcohol (10-20%)."
Sea Foam Pros	"1. InexpensiveIt?s not cheap to own and operate a vehicle. When parts are needed or equipment must be added, you are always looking at some level of expense, on top of what you are already spending to fill up the tank with fuel and keep up with maintenance.Depending on where you purchase your Sea Foam container, you could spend as little as $20. It?s hard to get anything for your vehicle for such a low price, making this product a great value for the benefits it offers. 2. Clean EnginesClean Internal EngineIf you use the Sea Foam additive in the engine, it can offer many benefits to the oil and motor. It?s designed to remove residue and deposits left in the engine after many miles of use. This debris can prevent oil flow from occurring naturally, leaving the engine underperforming. Sea Foam can also improve lubrication and prevent corrosion. It?s also used by customers that are concerned about the deterioration of the seals, ensuring a longer life. 3. Stabilizes FuelSea Foam can also be used in the fuel system to stabilize it. If you store your vehicle, the stabilizer helps to reduce evaporation and can increase its potency over time.The manufacturer recommends using the additive to stabilize fuel for up to two years. However, not everyone agrees that it?s good for this long. Even short-term storage might benefit from the use of the additive. 4. Saves Money on RepairsIf something starts to fail on your vehicle, you could be looking at an expensive repair. However, there?s always the chance that a simple bottle of Sea Foam could repair the issue or prolong the need for the repair.For example, if your car has dirty fuel injectors, you might try a can of Sea Foam before replacing them. Even having the fuel injectors cleaned can cost $200 or more, so it makes financial sense to possibly try the additive first. "
Sea Foam Cons	"1. Thins OilDrain OilWhen you put too much Sea Foam in your engine, the oil can be thinned out. It?s vitally important that the oil viscosity remains consistent with the manufacturer?s specifications to keep the motor running its best. If the additive alters this viscosity, there could be bigger problems to deal with.For this reason, it?s important not to put in more Sea Foam than what?s recommended. You don?t want to add too much and reduce the lubrication and protection of the motor oil.2. Possible Damage to O2 SensorSea Foam isn?t likely to damage a well-functioning oxygen sensor. However, if the O2 sensor is already on its way out, the additive might accelerate the process.Once the oxygen sensor fails, the engine starts to run rougher. Fuel economy also suffers and the car could fail an emissions test. 3. Decreased Fuel EconomySome people prefer to use Sea Foam in the fuel tank to clean the system. If you do this, it?s possible to notice a decrease in gas mileage.Of course, this decrease isn?t going to be anything major or a permanent increase. Still, no one wants to spend more on fuel than necessary. 4. Not Compatible with All EnginesIf the car engine contains direct injectors, you don?t want to use Sea Foam in the motor. As the additive loosens up the dirt, debris and sludge, it will end up in the injectors and a clog could form. Sadly, if this happens, you might need to spend hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars for repair. The cost is even higher if you have a diesel direct-injection motor. "
Should I Use Sea Foam?	"Sea Foam is an inexpensive way to clean the engine. It?s also able to stabilize fuel and help you save money on car repairs. On the other hand, Sea Foam can thin out the oil if you use too much. It also isn?t compatible with all engines, can damage the O2 sensor, and decrease fuel economy.You are the only person that can decide whether or not Sea Foam motor treatment might be a viable option. If repairs already seem necessary and you have a compatible engine, it might be worth the low cost to add a bottle and see what happens. On the other hand, you don?t want more damage to occur. If a vital system is taken out because of the additive usage, you could be facing a much higher repair cost that puts you in a bind."
How to Use Sea Foam ?	"1. In CrankcaseIf you put Sea Foam in the engine, you are looking to clean up sludge and reduce contaminants. One can of the additive treats up to 16 quarts of oil, so you probably won?t need it all.Put the appropriate amount into the oil at least 500 miles before you get an oil change. You can use the remainder of the can after the oil change. This process ensures most of the contaminants are removed. 2. In Fuel TankFuel AdditiveYou can also dump some Sea Foam directly into the fuel tank. With this process, you help to reduce deposits and buildup in the pump and injectors. One bottle is meant for up to 16 gallons of fuel. Use the appropriate amount based on how large your vehicle?s tank is. 3. On Top-EndIf you hope to clean out the deposits from the intake valves, combustion chambers or air intake system, you can use the Sea Foam Spray Top Engine Cleaner. It?s the same composition as the general Sea Foam additive, except it?s sold in an aerosol spray. The bottle comes with a hook tool that can be inserted into the air intake. This intake is often found before the throttle plates of the throttle body. Start the car engine once you have located the appropriate application area. Let the engine warm up and increase the idle speed to 2,000 RPM before you spray the contents into the intake. Allow for a Hot Soak for 15 minutes after turning off the engine. Once the 15 minutes have elapsed, take the vehicle for a drive and be a little more aggressive with the throttle usage. After about five to ten minutes of driving, the intake should be fairly cleaned out. 4. In Diesel Fuel FilterWhen you perform a diesel fuel filter change, you can use Sea Foam instead of diesel fuel to prime the filter. Take off the old fuel filter and remove the existing diesel fuel from its housing if it?s the drop-in variety. If you have a spin-in type filter, you can fill it up with the additive before installing it. Start the motor and allow the engine to run for two minutes. Shut down the engine and leave it off for 15 minutes. Once that time has passed, you are ready to drive normally to ensure the injectors continue being cleaned."
Do I put Sea foam in before or after gas refill?	"It?s recommended that you add Sea foam AFTER you?ve filled up your gas tank ? not before. However, it?s not very important as long as the sea foam gets mixed with the new fuel."
Can I put Sea Foam in a full gas tank?	"You can add sea foam to a full gas tank, but you have to figure out how much sea foam to mix into the gas. For regular fuel system maintenance, add 1 ounce of sea foam per gallon of gas."
How quickly does Sea Foam work?	"There is no definitive answer to this question. Some people report that they see and feel a difference within minutes of using Sea Foam, while others say that it takes a few weeks or even a month before they notice a difference. It depends on how much your drive and how much buildup your car has."
Do I have to change the oil after Sea Foam?	"You don?t have to, but it can be a good idea to change the engine oil 200 to 500 miles after the sea foam oil treatment."
How to Reset a Throttle Position Sensor ?	"The methods you use to reset the throttle position sensor on your car depend entirely on the car model you drive. On some car models, you can reset the throttle body sensor by disconnecting the battery, while on others you need to use a diagnostic tool to reset and calibrate it.Before you reset the throttle body sensor, you may want to ensure that it?s mechanically calibrated if that is possible on your car model. Here are some of the common methods for resetting a throttle position sensor:1. Use an OBD2 scannerThe easiest way to reset a throttle sensor and calibrate it on most modern car models is to use an OBD2 scanner. However, to do this, you need to make sure that the diagnostic scanner you buy is compatible with your car engine and has a throttle sensor reset feature for your car model.You can find many OBD2 scanners for cheap, but it won?t help if it?s not compatible with your car, so you should do a lot of research before you decide to buy one. Additionally, for some car models, it is only possible to reset the throttle sensor manually.2. Push AcceleratorYou might be able to reset the sensor without much effort. Turn on the vehicle without starting the engine and leave the key in the ON position. If you have a keyless start, just push the button one time, not enough to crank the engine over.Hold down the accelerator pedal for twenty seconds. You want it to go as close to the floor as possible. Release it slowly and turn the car off. Now, start the engine normally and go for a drive to see if the situation has improved. 3. Remove FuseThe sensor is an electronic aspect of the vehicle. It is run through a fuse. By pulling out the fuse, you cause a manual reset of the sensor. Find the fuse box and the appropriate fuse. This information can be found in the owner?s manual. Pull out the fuse and leave it out for ten minutes. After you replace it, the throttle body sensor should have reset. However, so will anything else that?s also run by that fuse. 4. Drive the VehicleIn some cases, it takes driving the vehicle to reset the sensor. Start the engine and drive down the highway at maximum speeds. You want to be consistently over 40 mph.Once you get the car up to highway speeds, you should slowly accelerate and decelerate slightly. Give a few minutes in between each session. The sensor may reset, providing better responsiveness. 5. Disconnect BatteryWhenever you want to reset something electronic, disconnecting the battery can help. Take off the negative cable from the battery.Allow the battery to remain disconnected for five minutes before reconnecting it. When you do this, everything electronic in the car will reset, including the clock and stereo preset. For this reason alone, most people prefer starting with one of the other methods first.6. Drain Car PowerEven when you remove the battery connection, many aspects of the car can retain power. If nothing else is working, you want to drain the power from every aspect of the car in hopes of resetting the sensor. Start by disconnecting the battery, both the positive and negative cables. Jump into the car and turn on the ignition and press the brake pedal.You may want to wait 10 to 30 minutes for this procedure. During this time, any power will drain from the vehicle. Reconnect the battery cables and start the engine. The sensor should be reset. 7. Idle EngineCrank the engine over and allow the car to idle for three minutes. Once the time is up, turn the car off.Go ahead and repeat these steps again. In a few models, you can turn the key ON without starting the engine with the same results. Reference the service manual to see what?s appropriate for your car."
What is the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS)?	"The throttle position sensor (TPS) can be found alongside the throttle body. It?s a sensor that includes a magnetic disk to send electronic pulses to the engine control module (ECM). This sensor alerts the computer about the position of the throttle, whether it is open or closed. When the car needs more speed, the throttle must open up. On the other side, the throttle must close when the car is slowing down. Additionally, during idling, the throttle must be mostly closed, still allowing gas to flow through to the engine. The computer utilizes the information received by the TPS to idle the idle speed. When you let off the accelerator pedal, the car needs to continue pumping gas so it doesn?t stall. The computer will also look at the cylinders to determine if they are receiving enough fuel to continue combustion."
what are the Signs of Defective Throttle Body Sensor  ?	"1. Check Engine LightWhen any sensor fails or isn?t optimized, the Check Engine Light can come on the dashboard. Because the engine control module is monitoring the throttle body sensor, you can expect this light to come on when there?s a problem.An error code will be stored in the computer that can be read with your OBDII scanner. In most cases, you might see Code P2119, which stands for ?Throttle Actuator Control Throttle Body Range/Perfomance.? This is the code that occurs when the throttle sensor is out of range. 2. Rough IdleWhen the throttle body sensor isn?t working properly, the idle could be off. RPMs could drop or be higher than normal because of the defects. Not only can this cause the engine to stall, but your car could also go through more fuel than it should. With the air-fuel ratio imbalance, you want to have the problem resolved right away. 3. Trouble AcceleratingThere could be a lack of power when the sensor fails. Without the right amount of power, acceleration can be troublesome. Not only will there be some hesitation, but the car can also jerk.There?s also the chance that your car can accelerate on your own. If the butterfly valve opens on its own when it should be closed, the car can propel forward. On the other hand, the most probable symptom is that you will have trouble getting the car to go faster, even when you push down the gas pedal.4. Limp ModeIf the situation is dire, the car can go into limp mode. This default setting occurs whenever something is happening that has the potential to harm the engine. Power is cut off to certain car functions to ensure better protection.However, it?s hard to drive the vehicle in limp mode. You can put the four-way lights on to alert others to the trouble. If you only have to drive a short distance, you might be able to make it. Otherwise, you might consider having the vehicle towed for your protection. "
what are the Steps to Clean the Throttle Body ?	"If there?s a problem with the throttle body itself, you might be able to clean it versus replacing it. Here are some general steps you could follow.Locate the throttle body. It is usually between the air filter and intake manifold. Normally, you can clean the throttle body without removing it.With a carburetor or brake cleaner and a microfiber cloth, carefully get rid of any carbon buildup or dirt. Test drive the car. You can gain more guidance by following the directions found in your car?s service manual. Otherwise, you need to visit a professional for more help."
Do I have to reset the computer after replacing the throttle position sensor?	"Most car models will reset and calibrate the throttle position sensor by itself after you replace the sensor and turn on the ignition. However, on some car models you may need to calibrate it manually or reset it by disconnecting the battery or using an OBD2 scanner."
Does a throttle position sensor need to be calibrated?	"If your car has a throttle cable, you often must manually calibrate the throttle sensor according to a repair manual for your car model. If your car uses an electronic throttle, the car can calibrate the sensor automatically when you turn on the ignition."
Is there a fuse for the throttle position sensor?	"There is no fuse for only the throttle position sensor in most car models. However, there should be a fuse for the engine control module that sends the power to the throttle position sensor. Check your owner?s manual for the fuse location."
Does the throttle position sensor affect idle?	"Yes. A bad throttle sensor can affect the idle and result in a rough or unstable idle. If you suspect that the throttle position sensor is bad, you need to scan the trouble code memory with a code scanner."
How much horsepower does a cold air intake add?	"A cold air intake can improve your engine?s performance by 0 to 20 horsepower, depending on the car model and engine. Large and turbocharged engines will often do best by installing a cold air intake.Smaller non-turbocharged engines will most likely not see a noticeable performance change by installing a cold air intake. However, this isn?t the only benefit which is why cold air intake is often a great investment. "
What is a Cold Air Intake?	"Modern vehicles are set up to avoid pulling hot air into the engine, but there?s usually still room for improvement. With an aftermarket cold air intake, tubing is included to relocate the filter and cold air box to avoid any heated air entering the motor. These kits usually also include a performance filter for better gains.Depending on how much you spend, you might also get a large throttle body with your kit. Otherwise, it could also include a ram scoop to push more air into the intake for even better performance. "
what are the Pros of a Cold Air Intake ?	"1. Increased HorsepowerFor many people, the reason for upgrading to a cold air intake is to get more horsepower out of the engine. Because the intake directs cooler air into the engine, the fuel burns more efficiently for added power. As the oxygen combustion increases, you see a boost in horsepower. In some cars, you might only see five horsepower added, but others can achieve a larger gain. It all depends on the car you drive and what cold air intake you choose.2. Improved AccelerationWith the increased horsepower, you should also see a boost in the acceleration times. Your vehicle becomes more responsive as cold air is pumped into the combustion chamber.Because cold air is denser than hot air, there?s more of it available during combustion. With this increased efficiency, you will be able to hit desired speeds much faster. Think of the benefits of this acceleration when you pull out onto an interstate or highway.3. Better MileageWith a cold air intake, you enhance the air-to-fuel ratio of your motor. The more air that flows through, the less fuel it is going to burn through. What you see as a result is an improved gas mileage. Everyone wants fewer trips to the fuel station, especially as prices rise.4. Improved FiltersThe stock intake in your vehicle probably doesn?t have high-performance filters included. Instead, the material is likely just paper, which needs to be replaced often and can easily fail.The aftermarket intake is going to have a sturdier filter type. These aren?t just going to protect the system better, but many of them can be cleaned instead of replaced. You may only need to clean the filter every 50,000 miles with some models. 5. Superior SoundOnce you put the cold air intake on your vehicle, you?ll notice a unique sound. It?s not only going to be louder but also fuller.As the engine gets more cold air, the sound becomes louder. However, you can find intakes that muffle the noise if you prefer, so you aren?t stuck with the performance-centered sound."
what are the Cons of a Cold Air Intake ?	"1. Need Filter DiscernmentWe told you that the cold air intake uses a better filter, but you must still be careful. With many models, you can choose what type of filter is used. If you are to pick up a cheap filter, it could lead to trouble.For example, foam filters allow for more horsepower. Yet, these filters gather too much dirt and debris, all of which could easily end up in the engine. For this reason, it?s important to perform plenty of research before you decide what to use.2. Idle ChangesA cold air intake could have a bend reaching ninety degrees. With this type of change, the idle may be affected. It?s more noticeable when also combined with other aftermarket components.If the engine starts to suck an excessive amount of air in, the idle will act differently. In some cases, you don?t need to do anything about it, but you might want to have a professional double-check the situation. 3. CostIf you leave your vehicle the way it is now, you don?t have to spend any money on upgrades. To install an aftermarket cold air intake, you are going to pay out a decent amount of money.You could spend anywhere from $50 to $1,500 for a new air intake. If you choose a performance model, the price could go even higher. If you are on a budget, you might not believe that this expense is worth the gains that are provided. 4. Difficult InstallationIf you have some mechanical ability, you might be able to install your own cold air intake. However, that?s not the case for your average driver.If you need to take your vehicle to a local mechanic for the installation, you have more of an expense than you originally thought. Factoring in this hourly rate can cause the expense to jump up significantly."
How to Install a Cold Air Intake ?	"If you choose to perform your own cold air intake installation, you will need some basic tools. It?s also important that you choose a model that?s specific to your car. Otherwise, the fit might not be correct.Here are some general guidelines to follow, but you should always reference the manual that came with your aftermarket part.Remove the cover on the air filter box.Take out the factory filter.Disconnect the MAF sensor?s power cable.With a set of pliers, take the clip off that holds the air filter hose in place. Take the screws out of the filter housing to remove it.Remove the MAF sensors from the housing. Make a mark on it, so you know which direction it should face.Put the pipe of the air intake on the engine bay to figure out the appropriate fit. You can reference the instructions to figure out what needs to be taken off.Make sure the new pipe is secured in place. Install the MAF sensor. Make sure you put it facing the correct way.Connect your MAF sensor with the power connector.Put the new air filter in place to finalize the setup.If, at any point, this process becomes too confusing for you, it?s best to have a professional look at it closer. You don?t want to make a mistake that costs you more money than you what you needed to initially spend."
Is a cold air intake worth the money?	"There are pros and cons to using a cold air intake. The main benefit is that it allows your engine to breathe more cold air, which can lead to increased performance. However, cheap cold air intake kits can cause damage to your engine. So if it?s worth it is totally up to you. Don?t expect crazy results from a cold air intake kit."
Will a cold air intake damage my engine?	"It?s possible that a cold air intake could damage your engine if it?s not installed correctly. If you buy a cheap cold air intake kit with a bad engine air filter, it can also cause damage to your engine. Ensure that you buy a cold air intake kit from a known and reputable company."
Does a cold air intake save more gas?	"Cold air intakes funnel cooler air into the engine, which can lead to more efficient combustion and better fuel economy. Overall, though, the extent to which a cold air intake will improve gas mileage varies depending on the make and model of car. You shouldn?t expect any huge results from just a cold air intake kit, though."
Does a cold air intake increase sound?	"Yes a cold air intake kit increases the engine sound in most car models. However, it depends on a variety of factors such as the make and model of the car, the design of the cold air intake, and the installation. However, in general, a cold air intake should increase the sound of your engine because it allows for more airflow and higher RPMs."
what are the Symptoms Of Bad Gas In The Tank? 	"The most common symptoms of bad gas in your fuel tank are engine performance issues and a check engine light on your dashboard. You may notice acceleration issues, a stalling engine, or an engine that won?t start up at all.Here is a more detailed list of the most common signs of bad gas in your car to look for:1. Check Engine LightWhen there?s a fault with the car engine, you will likely see a dashboard light alerting you to the trouble. If the Check Engine Light comes on, you must consider the possibility that the gas is bad.However, this light alone won?t tell you what?s wrong. You want to use a professional code scanner to gain a better idea about what?s going on. 2. Acceleration IssuesUnder normal conditions, the car should respond instantly when you step on the gas pedal. If there?s any hesitation when it?s time to move, there could be an issue, including the possibility of bad gas. If bad gas is to blame, you might notice more trouble as the speeds go higher. It?s also possible that the car stops accelerating at all when the conditions are terrible. There?s also the chance that you are experiencing erratic changes in speed one way or the other. You can have your foot off of the accelerator pedal and notice that the RPMs change on their own. These erratic changes all indicate a fuel issue, whether it?s bad gas or failure of a vital component. 3. Stalling EngineIf you are driving fine and the engine starts stalling, you might consider the fuel quality. If bad fuel is in the system, combustion can?t occur as it should. The engine needs high-quality fuel mixed with the appropriate amount of air to burn properly. Without good gas, the demand on the engine becomes too high and the motor can stop. 4. Engine Doesn?t StartIn the worst-case scenario, the engine won?t start at all. This can happen after it has stalled or when you are first trying to start it. If water and condensation or any contaminants have mixed with the gas, the engine might not be able to start. However, there are so many reasons for a car not to start. That?s why you have to look at all of the symptoms as a whole to figure out what?s going on. 5. Damaged Fuel FilterIn the fuel system, there?s a filter that keeps debris, contaminants and dirt out of the engine. All gas tanks have some sediment on the bottom. The role of the filter is to ensure none of this makes it to the motor, which would have disastrous effects. If you have to change the fuel filter prematurely, it could be due to bad fuel. That?s why it?s important to keep an eye on the health of the filter and change it at regular intervals. "
How to Remove Bad Gas in My Car ?	"1. Use Dry GasolineDry gasoline would be the first solution, but it?s not guaranteed. If there?s a minimal amount of water or condensation in the tank, the dry gas might get you back up and running. This alcohol-based additive treats a tank that was once contaminated. Follow the directions on the label to get going.2. Siphon Out GasIf dry gas doesn?t solve your problem, the only solution is to drain the tank. There are three ways you can do this, with siphoning being the easiest.With a siphoning tube, you can empty the tank. However, you should never do this unless you understand the right way to do it. Additionally, you must make sure that the bad gas is placed in a qualified container and disposed of properly.3. Drop Gas TankIf all else fails, you have to drop the gas tank to empty it. This is no small task and it might be best to have a professional handle the job. Again, you must have something to hold all of the gas you remove from the tank. You also need to dispose of it properly to ensure it doesn?t get dumped unethically. 4. Fill Up with Premium FuelOnce the dry gasoline is installed, you can fill the tank back up. I recommend using high-octane fuel, even if you don?t normally. This is an important step no matter what kind of car you drive.You want the engine to receive the best gas possible to ensure it can get started once again. The only way to counteract what?s been done is to pump through some good gas.5. Use Drain Plug (Older vehicles)Most vehicles don?t have a drain plug, such as what?s used to perform an oil change. However, there are some older makes and models that use it.If your vehicle has a drain plug, you can drain the tank into a pan. Just remember that you need an adequate container to hold all of the gas as the tank could be very full. You won?t be able to stop the flow once it begins. "
How to Avoid Bad Gas ?	"1. Don?t Leave Fuel Sitting in The TankIf you don?t drive your vehicle a lot, you need to consider the gas that?s in the tank. Just as you would take steps to protect the car battery, you must also think about the fuel.If your vehicle will be in storage for three months or more, it?s best to drain the tank. There are some fuel stabilizers you could use, but they aren?t guaranteed to work long-term. 2. Visit Top-Tier StationsA top-tier gas station offers fuel that?s held to a higher standard. There are plenty of top-tier gas stations available in the country and you don?t always need to pay more for this level of quality.In fact, Costco is one of the many stations that promise top-tier fuel. You can get discounted gas at these locations with a membership. 3. Use AdditivesThere are all kinds of fuel additives available, so it?s important to know what you are getting if you want to put something in your tank. Gas treatment and fuel injection cleaners all have a specific purpose, but won?t help to keep the fuel fresh.Instead, you want a fuel stabilizer formula. If you aren?t driving often, the fuel stabilizer helps to maintain the quality by absorbing some of the water and slowing down oxidation. "
Will bad gas ruin your engine?	"Yes. Bad gas can damage your engine parts in several different ways. First of all, it can clog the fuel system. It can also cause performance issues that can damage your engine in the long run."
Will adding new gas to old gas help?	"Although mixing old gas and new gas will probably make the gas better than it was before, it is not recommended. To avoid problems and a waste of money, it is much better to drain the old gas before filling the tank with new gas."
How long can gas sit in a car before it goes bad?	"Regular gasoline will naturally begin to degrade over time after 3 months. It may take over 1-2 years before you start to notice any problems with the gas, but it happens gradually and depends on the environment where the car is parked."
Can I drive with bad gas?	"Whether you can drive with bad gas depends on how old and bad the gas is and what type of vehicle you drive. However, driving with bad gas is never recommended, as it can cause many other problems with your vehicle such as clogging the fuel system or damaging other engine parts."
How Much Does A Timing Chain Replacement Cost?	"The average timing chain replacement may cost $1,500 to $4,000 if you visit a professional repair shop. If you have the skills, equipment and expertise to replace it yourself, you may only spend $500 to $900 instead, but it?s not normally an easy fix for the average home mechanic. "
Factors Affecting Timing Chain Replacement Cost ?	"1. Make/Model of CarWhile there are some newer models that have a timing chain, the majority of the vehicles are going to be older. Mostly because timing chains often hold up quite long.With this in mind, the type of vehicle you drive is going to have a big effect on how much you spend on the timing chain. Some brands have much lower prices for some reason. For example, Honda OEM timing chains are often cheaper than other brands in many cases. However, you normally have the option to purchase an aftermarket chain kit, which could save you a little bit of money. Just keep in mind that some aftermarket parts are junk, so you want to research the quality before making the switch. A timing chain is something you don?t want to take any risks with, as it could result in total engine failure.2. Labor RateWhile the timing chain is an expensive part to replace, the labor is going to make up a significant chunk of the bill. There are some engines that require removing a lot of parts to get the chain out. It must also align with all of the tensioners, timing gauges and gears to work correctly. Depending on where you live, you could have a hefty labor bill. If you live in the country, you might spend far less on labor than if you live in a busy city. Take the labor rate in your area and multiply by about four to eight hours to get an approximate cost.Of course, if you can replace your own timing chain, you are going to save a lot of money. However, this isn?t a job that should be done by anyone without the experience required. 3. Additional Repairs NeededIn most car models, it is not just the timing chain that is replaced during the operation. Tensioners, gaskets, and many other parts are often replaced at the same time as the chain is replaced.It doesn?t cost much more for the parts. Plus, the labor will be cheaper while the chain is already off. As an example, the chain tensioner is another part that tends to go bad. The symptoms of a bad timing chain are similar to that of a bad tensioner, so it?s important to get the right diagnostics before making any repairs. "
What is a Timing Chain?	"The timing chain is responsible for connecting the engine crankshaft and camshaft. It?s needed to ensure the right timing between the parts.With a timing chain, the gears attached to the camshafts and crankshaft wouldn?t turn in unison with one another. In some vehicles, the timing chain can also run other vital components, giving it a dual purpose. "
How Does the Timing Chain Work?	"The timing chain is located on the motor, behind the timing cover. If you think of a bicycle chain, the timing chain isn?t much different, except it?s much thicker. This vital part is used to pair the camshaft timing gear with the crankshaft timing gear.It?s held in place with a timing chain tensioner. With this tensioner, the chain won?t skip or jump. It gets held in place, so the crankshaft and camshaft gears can turn at the appropriate speeds. "
what are the Symptoms of a Bad Timing Chain ?	"1. Grinding NoiseIf your car?s pulleys start to make a grinding noise, it could be that the timing chain isn?t in place. When the timing chain becomes loose, it can start to grind.It also occurs if the bearings go out or the pulleys fail. To figure out what?s causing the problem, you must do a complete inspection. 2. Engine MisfireWhen the timing chain becomes loose, the camshaft and crankshaft are not aligned properly. This fault causes your engine to misfire. As the cylinder valves close at a different rate from what the engine needs, you are going to notice issues.However, the misfiring engine is caused by lots of different issues, so you can?t just assume it?s the timing chain. It could also be from damaged valves, a bad spark plug or some other fault. When the engine misfires, you will probably also see a check engine light on your dashboard.3. Difficulty StartingIf your vehicle?s engine doesn?t start, it could be due to a faulty timing chain. You also need to look at the ignition system, battery and starter.Still, don?t overlook the possibility that the timing belt has come loose. When this happens, the crankshaft and cam can?t synchronize, leading to an engine that start. 4. Banging/Knocking/rattling noiseIf you have a loose belt, it could bang or knock in the engine bay. The chain can bang into the pulleys or the chain cover. However, this is only going to occur if the chain has become very loose. In comparison, a loose timing belt creates more of a slapping sound. 5. Reduced Fuel EconomyWhenever engine operations aren?t optimized, your car can use more fuel than normal. In general, you aren?t going to notice the drop in fuel economy unless you are paying close attention.Additionally, the lack of power could become noticeable. To get your car going normally, you might need to push more aggressively on the pedal, which in turn, also uses more fuel. "
Can I Drive with a Bad Timing Chain?	"It?s not advisable to drive once the timing chain is damaged. Even if you suspect that it could be going bad, you should inspect it right away. Depending on the damage, you might even prefer to have it towed to the nearest service center.Otherwise, driving with a bad timing chain can lead to engine failure. If the valves and pistons collide because of the faulty timing, your motor could be destroyed. Instead of simply needing a new timing chain, you will be looking at a rebuilt or replaced engine, which is much more expensive to deal with.Additionally, if the timing chain breaks completely, the engine won?t start. You will be forced to replace the timing chain before you can drive anywhere. That?s why we always recommend getting everything looked at, no matter how minor you believe the symptoms might be. It?s better to err on the side of caution and save yourself from future headaches."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Turbocharger ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad turbocharger are low engine performance, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell. You may also notice reduced fuel economy and a check engine light on your car?s dashboard.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing turbocharger to look for:1. Power ReductionThe main purpose of the turbocharger is to provide power to the engine. When the turbocharger begins to fail, you will notice a drop in power and acceleration. You may notice a small loss of power at first, but a blown turbo is going to create a massive drop. While the power aspect of the car will be affected, there shouldn?t be any other handling issue. The turbocharger has no control over steering or braking. If these conditions are occurring in conjunction with the power loss, there could be something else wrong. 2. Burning/Leaking OilAs the turbocharger fails, there?s going to be oil leaking from the system. The turbo needs oil to run, just like the engine. However, a worn turbo can have a cracked gasket or seal. Additionally, the turbo can crack, causing an oil leak. Oil that leaks from the turbo will be burned. This dripping oil might not be noticeable with a visual inspection, but it can be burned up through the exhaust system, leading to an excessive amount of smoke. 3. Excessive Exhaust SmokeWith more oil making its way into the exhaust, you can expect more smoke, as we just touched on. This smoke might appear grey or blue, whereas normal exhaust doesn?t generally have a color. There could also be a strange smell coming from the exhaust smoke. However, there are plenty of mechanical failures that can cause exhaust smoke, many of which don?t have to do with the turbocharger. A blown head gasket, a leaking valve seals or internal engine failure are all causes of smoke too.4. Change in SoundThe turbocharger is going to make some level of noise with regular operation. The noise should be faint and barely noticeable. You may hear a soft whistling sound as the turbo starts up or a whooshing noise. If the sound starts to change, you may be looking at a turbocharger problem. If it begins humming or rattling, there?s something wrong. You want to have it looked at before the problem grows. 5. Reduced Fuel EconomyWhen the engine is optimized and running as it should, you should be able to get the normal amount of fuel economy out of it. However, any time that the engine is running roughly or is failing in some fashion, the fuel economy is going to drop. The same is true when the turbocharger starts to go bad. With the failing turbo, air can?t pass through efficiently as it was designed to. The exiting exhaust also won?t power the turbo the way it should. Because of this, you will notice a drop in the fuel economy numbers. 6. Check Engine LightThere are countless reasons why the Check Engine Light will come on. Still, if you are noticing other bad turbocharger symptoms when the light comes on, you can put two and two together. With your code scanner, you can pinpoint the exact problem. If you notice anything other than turbo codes, you want to fix those first to ensure that you don?t replace unnecessary parts. 7. Incorrect Boost ReadingYou may not have a boost gauge in your car. These are aftermarket parts that generally get added to sportier vehicles. However, if you have one, it?s going to give you a lot of information about the turbo boost function.If the gauge shows that the boost isn?t holding or building correctly, you know there?s a problem. For this reason alone, it might be worthwhile installing a gauge if you don?t already have one. "
what is the Turbocharger Function ?	"The turbocharger is a part that works in conjunction with the engine. It uses exhaust gases to spin the turbine so it can suck air into the intake. The turbocharger sends compressed air from the intake side directly into the motor, where it can create additional power. This process is known as forced induction. Power can be measured by the amount of compressed air being pumped into the engine. The more air, the more power you can expect. "
where the Turbocharger Location ?	"The turbocharger gets bolted directly to the exhaust manifold in most cases, which is on the engine. The exhaust coming from the engine will cause the turbine to spin.This turbine is connected to the compressor with a shaft. This compressor is found between the intake manifold and the air filter. "
Turbocharger Replacement Cost ?	"The cost to replace a bad turbocharger can range anywhere from $1,000 to $4,500. Several factors that influence the cost include the size of the vehicle and the cost of labor. A few models are much easier to work with than others.If the mechanic has to remove many parts to get to the turbocharger, you are going to pay more for the repairs.In general, a stock turbocharger should last the lifetime of the vehicle. With good maintenance, you should be able to get 100,000 to 150,000 miles out of the turbocharger without any trouble. "
how to make Turbocharger Testing  ?	"Turbocharger testing typically involves checking the performance of the turbocharger to ensure it is functioning correctly. Here are some steps to follow for testing a turbocharger:Visual Inspection: Start by inspecting the turbocharger for any obvious signs of damage or wear. Look for things like cracks, dents, or bent fins on the compressor or turbine wheels.Check the Bearings: Test the bearings by grabbing the compressor wheel and checking for any movement. If the wheel moves side to side or up and down, it indicates that the bearings may be worn and need to be replaced.Check for Boost: Use a boost gauge to check the amount of boost the turbocharger is producing. Compare the reading to the manufacturer's specifications to determine if the turbocharger is producing the correct amount of boost.Check for Leaks: Check for air leaks in the intake and exhaust systems. These leaks can cause a loss of boost pressure, leading to poor performance and reduced efficiency.Check for Oil Leaks: Check for oil leaks around the turbocharger, which can be a sign of a damaged oil seal or a worn bearing.Check the Wastegate: Inspect the wastegate to ensure it is functioning correctly. The wastegate controls the amount of boost pressure produced by the turbocharger and needs to be adjusted properly to ensure optimal performance.Dyno Testing: Consider dyno testing to measure the turbocharger's performance under load. Dyno testing can help identify any performance issues that may not be apparent during a visual inspection or boost pressure test.It's important to note that turbocharger testing can be complex and may require specialized equipment and knowledge. If you're not comfortable testing the turbocharger yourself, consider taking your car to a mechanic or turbocharger specialist for testing."
Can I Drive With a Bad Turbocharger?	"While we suggest you never drive with a bad turbocharger; Yes, it is still possible to drive your vehicle when the turbo is damaged or blown. Still, that does not mean you want to keep driving. If the turbo impeller gets damaged it will get sucked into the engine and this can cause serious engine damage.The longer you drive with a blown turbo, the higher the chances are that the engine will need repairs. It?s already going to be expensive enough to fix the turbocharger, you don?t need to add engine repair into that bill. While you drive, you are also going to notice a drop in power. That?s another reason we recommend that you cease driving once you notice there?s a problem and you take the vehicle to your mechanic."
Conclusion	"As you can see, there are many different symptoms of a bad turbocharger that can occur in your vehicle. If you experience any of these symptoms above, it is important to take your car to a professional mechanic as soon as possible for repair. These problems will only get worse over time and can eventually lead to severe engine failure and expensive repair costs."
What Are The Symptoms of a Cracked Cylinder Head?	"1. Warning LightsIf the malfunction is large enough, there will be warning lights illuminating on your dashboard. You could see the Check Engine Light, especially if the motor is misfiring. However, a cracked cylinder head alone might not trigger this alert. Beyond that, it?s possible to see a low coolant level light or high-temperature light if the coolant levels are dropping to low. Any one of these lights should be taken seriously at first sight.2. Oil/Coolant MixtureWhen the cylinder head cracks, it can replicate a lot of what is seen with a blown head gasket. One of the symptoms that is the same between the two is that the coolant and oil can mix.However, combustion gases can also enter the cooling system because of this problem, which you could confuse for an oil mixture, except this looks more like bubbles. Either way, the coolant should look like coolant, just as motor oil should only resemble oil. If either one looks odd, it?s best to have it examined closer. 3. White Smoke from ExhaustThe engine uses various coolant passages that run through the motor?s cylinder head to keep the temperature down. If there?s a crack in the cylinder head, coolant can leak into the combustion chamber, as we just discussed. When this happens, that coolant is going to burn up during the combustion that occurs.The result of this is white smoke coming from the exhaust system. The white smoke is steam, which comes from the tailpipe. It can also have a sweet smell because of the coolant. It?s a distinct smell, unlike any other fluid that could burn. 4. Lower Coolant LevelsWhen there?s a crack in the cylinder head, you already know coolant can enter the combustion chamber. So, what happens to the coolant level within the cooling system?Obviously, it?s going to be lower than you would expect. The rate at which the coolant level drops is directly correlated to how severe the crack is in the head. 5. Overheating EngineWhenever the coolant level drops, you can start dealing with an overheating engine. Without the coolant that?s required, it?s impossible to keep the motor oil cool as it circulates in the engine.If you have a temperature gauge on the dashboard, you will see it start to rise. Plus, the engine overheat warning light might come on, as previously discussed. You should never drive your engine when it is overheating or more damage could occur. 6. Rough Engine PerformanceFor an engine to run its best, everything must be at optimal levels. Not only does the spark need to be as set out by the factory specs, but there must also be a balanced air-to-fuel ratio, along with the right level of compression. When the cylinder head is cracked, there is some compression loss that?s going to affect how the engine runs. You might notice that the performance decreases, especially when power is needed the most. The engine will continue running rough and could also misfire if the damage is severe enough. "
Why Does the Cylinder Head Crack?	"Cylinder heads are designed to last for the lifetime of a car. New vehicles contain aluminum heads, while older cars might utilize iron. In either case, the gaskets or valves tend to fail before the cylinder heads, but this problem still occurs.In some cases, the cylinder heads fail because of a poor design. If there are flaws in the design, it?s easier for the cylinder heads to crack, which is why you see some complaints when new engines are used that aren?t reliable. However, the most common reason for the cylinder head to crack prematurely is because of a defective cooling system. If cooling system issues arise, the engine can overheat. When the engine overheats and deals with high pressure at the same time, the motor gets pushed beyond its limits and cracks can occur. It only takes one time for the engine to overheat for problems like this to occur. That?s why you want to have a failed water pump, coolant leaks and other malfunctions dealt with right away before it leads to bigger issues, such as this one. "
How to Test a Cracked Cylinder Head ?	"If you aren?t a professional mechanic, you want to know how you can troubleshoot the cracked cylinder head from home. Sadly, this isn?t something simple, such as checking for a fouled spark plug. Without the right mechanical equipment and advanced skills, you aren?t going to be able to tell what?s wrong with the cylinder head. However, you can pinpoint that a cracked cylinder head might be a problem. To do this, you want to look through the symptoms we listed above. If you are noticing these symptoms, you might choose to take your vehicle to the shop. Still, the problem could also be a blown head gasket, which exhibits with many of the same symptoms. To truly confirm that the cracked cylinder head is your problem, the engine will need to be pulled apart enough to see the area. For this reason, not every mechanic will handle the diagnosis either. You want to call and get your vehicle in with a professional that understands this condition and has experience dealing with it. "
Cracked Cylinder Head Repair Cost ?	"The typical car cylinder head replacement is going to cost you between $750 and $4,250 per head that must be replaced. This price depends heavily on what type of car you drive, where you take it for service and the labor cost of the mechanic. You will also need to pay for the diagnostics to determine if this is the problem. In addition to these costs, there could be other damage that needs to be repaired. If coolant and oil have mixed, these systems need to be emptied and refilled to ensure proper operation. Plus, if severe engine damage has occurred, you might be looking at a rebuild or replacement of the motor instead. On older vehicles, cracked cylinder heads were repaired, but that?s no longer the case. Today?s cylinder heads are built from aluminum, so it makes more sense to replace it versus repairing it."
What is a Procharger?	"Procharger is actually a brand name for superchargers. However, the procharger is often associated with a turbine driven by a belt. The procharger offers a lot of solutions to the issues caused by the basic supercharger. With the procharger, the engine gets a steady air stream. The procharger looks like a turbocharger with the same turbine, but it?s driven by a belt instead of the exhaust gases.With this centrifugal supercharger, a rotating impeller draws the air in and directs it back out, moving in a circular formation. This air converts to high pressure, where it gets driven from the procharger right into the engine, providing a consistent amount of force. With the constant flow of air, there?s no lag or waiting around for power. Plus, the procharger gets attached right to the engine. It?s compact, so there?s no need for additional modifications with most cars. The procharger also won?t produce an excessive amount of power, unlike the supercharger. Still, this unique design does add to the price. On top of that, the procharger can be much louder than your typical supercharger, even creating a whining sound when the engine revs. Some people aren?t fond of this sound that?s created. "
What is a Supercharger?	"Superchargers provide a lower-cost way to get power out of the engine. If you are shopping for a supercharger, there are different types, each with its own set of pros and cons. With a few of the superchargers, you might need to make modifications to the hood, so that?s something to be aware of.The most common and basic choice is to get a roots supercharger. It sits perfectly under the hood of many cars and gets connected to the intake manifold. Air is pushed back and forth between the mesh lobes to build up pressure within the intake manifold. This action provides short bursts of air into the engine, giving it surges of power. Otherwise, you could choose a twin-screw supercharger. This design relies on long screw-type parts that spin and draws air in to store up the pressure. These are smaller than the roots supercharger, so there isn?t as much room needed. Yet, this type is louder, often requiring some type of sound suppression, which further adds to the cost. While the supercharger is going to give you plenty of quick power, it doesn?t come in continuous bursts. This is probably the biggest complaint. While the lag isn?t as noticeable as with a turbocharger, there will be some that you might deal with. "
How to Choose Procharger and Supercharger ?	"1. Performance GainsWhether you are using a supercharger or procharger, you are clearly looking to add some more power to your engine. So, which one would suit you better? Both of them are going to provide some gains but in a different way. That?s why it?s crucial to understand your performance goals before you move on.With a supercharger, you might be able to get more power out of the engine than with a procharger. However, the power will come in bursts, so it?s not continual. The amount of lag is barely noticeable to some people and far less than what?s found with a turbocharger, which is why these cost more than a standard turbo.The procharger is known for providing a smoother stream of power, but not usually as much as the supercharger. While you aren?t going to wait at all, you might not get everything you want out of a procharger, especially if you are looking for maximum gains. Still, most prochargers won?t require big modifications to the car, while the supercharger might. This is something else to consider when deciding what?s important. 2. MaintenanceThe supercharger causes some stress on the car engine. For this reason, you must monitor oil levels more carefully than you would with the standard engine. You may also need to upgrade the fuel quality that you use.If you upgrade to premium fuel, you will help the engine last longer. However, not all vehicles should use premium fuel, so this is something to research carefully before you make changes.Additionally, you want to keep a close eye on the automatic transmission. With regular maintenance and care, you should be able to counteract any additional stress caused by the supercharger.On top of that, both the supercharger and procharger will contain a drive belt. This needs routine maintenance to ensure proper operation. Most drive belts should be changed every 50,000 to 70,000 miles. 3. PriceThere?s a lot of excitement in adding power to your car, but it comes at a cost. In return, the car?s value will go up, but not enough to justify what you spend. If you are working on a tight budget, you need to be careful which option you choose. Obviously, the turbocharger is the cheapest solution in most cases, but we are strictly looking at the supercharger vs. procharger.On the low end of the spectrum, you might find something for $2,500 or less, but you want to be careful about the quality. The price is heavily related to how much power you are going to get and the amount of durability. That?s why with either a supercharger or procharger is going to provide you with what you pay for. If you are looking for a long-lasting and reliable amount of power with either one, aim to spend a little more than the basic option. With a classic roots supercharger, you might be able to get a good enough unit for $2,500 to $3,000.With the supercharger though, you don?t want to buy something if you can?t take it to the extreme. In some regions, it?s illegal to use a supercharger to its tuned extreme. If this is the case, you will do better investing a little more in a procharger. Otherwise, you could be spending more on fines and traffic tickets that the cops give out to you.While the procharger is going to cost you more upfront, there are some economic benefits that add up over time. For example, the procharger doesn?t burn through as much fuel as most superchargers. If you are worried about fuel economy, this would be more cost-effective. The procharger also puts less stress on the engine. While you will still need to pay attention to the regular maintenance, you might not have as many problems as you could with the supercharger. It?s a delicate balancing act. You can pay less for a supercharger up front, but it could cost you over time. On the other hand, if you can invest more upfront, you will save down the road with a procharger. If saving up a little longer will get you a better unit, go ahead and put off the purchase for a short time."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Cam Phaser ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad cam phaser are lower engine performance and a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice that the engine is noisier than usual, indicating that you need to inspect and fix it immediately.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing cam phaser to look for:1. Check Engine LightThe car computer lets you know whenever something is wrong with the system. With the help of the powertrain control module (PCM), the camshaft positioning is always monitored through sensors. If the module gets a poor reading from the sensors, it?s going to turn on the Check Engine Light. While this positioning problem could be the result of something else, it?s commonly an issue with the cam phaser. By reading the diagnostic trouble codes with your professional scanner, you should be able to narrow down the problem better. 2. Reduced Engine PerformanceThe valve timing must be optimized to ensure the engine runs as it was intended. If the cam phaser isn?t operating correctly, the timing is going to be retarded or advanced. With either of these problems, the engine is going to exhibit performance issues as a result. You might notice trouble accelerating, a rough idle or trouble getting all of the power it normally exhibits. 3. Rattling NoisesThe cam phaser should lock in position when the engine is at its base idle. However, if the phaser has failed, it might not be capable of locking in place.What happens as a result is a knocking or rattling sound. You should hear it coming from the top of the motor. It?s easier to hear when the engine is idling or after it has been warmed up. "
What Causes the Cam Phaser to Fail?	"1. Low Oil PressureThe right amount of oil pressure is needed to provide power to each cam phaser. When the pressure is lacking, the cam phaser will go bad.You could be struggling with oil pressure in your vehicle because of the oil quality or a failing oil pump. Poor oil pressure can also lead to wear inside the phasers, since they are constructed from metal and require lubrication. 2. Wrong Oil ViscosityYou must use the right oil viscosity for the engine to ensure proper friction and lubrication. The engine constantly runs at extreme temperatures, and the wrong viscosity can lead to a lot of wear. With the right oil used, you also ensure proper pressure. Otherwise, the cam phasers are going to respond more slowly and become damaged. 3. Contaminated OilAs the oil gets old, it becomes contaminated with sludge, dirt and debris. All of these elements lead to a reduced oil flow, which affects the well-being of the cam phasers. That?s why you should always change the oil at appropriate intervals. If you are using synthetic oil, you won?t need to change it as frequently as you would conventional oil. Don?t forget to change the oil filter at the same time to ensure the fluid remains fresh. 4. Damaged Gear/SprocketMotor oil also helps to lubricate the gears and sprockets. If there is too much friction, these valuable parts are going to fail prematurely, leading to trouble with the cam phaser.If you are worried about proper lubrication, you can always add friction modifiers for less wear. However, today?s top oil manufacturers provide everything needed to keep the engine running smoothly. 5. Faulty ECUThe ECU is responsible for controlling the cam phasers. If a fault keeps the computer from doing its job, the phaser could fail.With the best code scanner, you can find these ECU problems quickly. By repairing it, you can ensure that the phasers continue working as intended. "
What is a Cam Phaser?	"The cam phaser is a part of the variable valve timing system. When it is bad, the Check Engine Light might come on, you might notice reduced engine performance and there might be a rattling noise. To replace a cam phaser, expect to spend $750 to $2,500, unless you can do it yourself. Today?s modern vehicles are equipped with variable valve timing systems. The cam phaser is an integral part of the VVT system, helping to improve efficiency, increase fuel economy and reduce emissions. These computer-controlled sprockets are mounted to the cam drive sprocket, thereby controlling the camshaft. Cam phasers are needed to change the camshaft position. It must remain in the right position with the crankshaft to ensure proper valve timing within the engine. "
How Do Cam Phasers Work?	"The main job of a cam phaser is to adjust the positioning of the engine?s camshaft. It is part of the VVT system, helping to adjust the camshaft position, so valve timing is perfected for optimal performance from the motor.The phasers are hydraulically operated and computer-controlled. You can find one at the end of each camshaft in the engine. Each one is activated by the VVT solenoid, otherwise known as the oil control solenoid. This solenoid is responsible for applying oil pressure to the cam phaser. Each one will contain its own solenoid. There are some vehicles containing a phaser for the intake and exhaust camshafts. However, you can find other models that only contain one phaser. Depending on what model you drive, this one phaser could be found on either the intake or exhaust camshaft. Cam phasers are responsible for rotating the camshaft. This action helps to close and open the valves when required. When the engine is at the lower RPMs, the phasers will open up the valves at specific times to increase throttle response and improve performance. When the RPMs are higher, the valves are timed differently to improve fuel efficiency and reduce harmful emissions. "
Is it Safe to Drive with a Bad Cam Phaser?	"If you know that the cam phaser is worn out, you don?t want to keep driving your car. Even if the vehicle continues to run without too much interruption, you are risking it by continuing to drive. The bad phaser could cause more damage to the exhaust or intake valves, the ECU, the motor, solenoids or the VCT. By putting off the repair, you might be causing a larger bill down the road. You could also lose power suddenly while you are driving. This problem puts you at risk of an accident and exposes others on the road to a dangerous situation. There?s no reason to expose others to hazardous conditions when you can have the vehicle fixed. "
Cam Phaser Replacement Cost ?	"On average, you may spend $750 to $2,500 to get the cam phasers replaced. This isn?t a simple job, and one that most novices will not tackle on their own. However, the total cost varies based on what type of vehicle you drive and where you take the car for repair. Yes, you can save some money by doing the repair yourself. However, if you aren?t sure what you are doing or you don?t have the right tools, you could cause additional damage. Instead, trust the professionals with this advanced repair."
Conclusion	"A failing cam phaser can lead to more serious issues like misaligned camshaft timing. Therefore it?s very important to fix the issue as soon as possible. Ignoring these symptoms can lead to serious engine damage, resulting in very expensive repairs."

how to test the Cam Phaser Testing ?	"Cam phasers are an important component of an engine's variable valve timing system, and they control the timing of the engine's intake and exhaust valves. Testing the cam phasers involves checking their performance to ensure that they are functioning correctly. Here are the steps to follow for cam phaser testing:Check for Engine Error Codes: Use an OBD-II scanner to check for any error codes related to the cam phaser or the variable valve timing system. Any error codes can provide an indication of the potential problem.Visual Inspection: Perform a visual inspection of the cam phasers to check for any signs of damage or wear. Look for any cracks, chips, or broken teeth on the gears.Listen for Noise: Listen for any unusual noise coming from the engine that could be a sign of a problem with the cam phasers. A ticking or rattling noise could indicate a problem with the phasers.Check the Timing: Use a timing light to check the engine's timing. A timing light will allow you to see if the cam phasers are advancing or retarding the timing correctly.Perform a Relative Compression Test: Use a relative compression tester to check the engine's compression on each cylinder. A low compression reading on one or more cylinders could indicate a problem with the cam phasers.Use a Diagnostic Tool: Use a diagnostic tool that can perform a specific test on the cam phasers, such as the Ford Cam Positioning Tool (CPT). This tool will allow you to test the phasers' ability to advance and retard the cam timing correctly.Inspect the Oil Control Valve: Check the oil control valve for any signs of damage or wear. The oil control valve controls the oil pressure that drives the cam phasers and needs to be functioning correctly for the phasers to operate correctly.It's important to note that cam phaser testing can be complicated and may require specialized equipment and knowledge. If you're not comfortable testing the cam phasers yourself, consider taking your vehicle to a mechanic or engine specialist for testing."
Reasons for Oil in Intake Manifold ?	"Oil could be in the intake manifold because of a bad PVC valve or a clog in one of the oil passages. There could also be a leaking valve seal or failing turbocharger, allowing oil into the intake manifold. If that?s not the problem, you should also take a look at the piston rings.However, if there is just a little bit of oil in the intake manifold, it could be completely normal. It?s when it?s flooding the intake manifold and causing blue smoke from your exhaust pipe that you should be worried.1. Faulty PVC ValveThe car?s PVC valve is needed to regulate the vacuum in the intake manifold. When it begins to fail, it could allow oil to enter instead. When this happens, you will notice that the engine starts to smoke.This is one of the easiest problems to fix on this list. I will discuss this issue in more detail in a minute. 2. Turbocharger FailureIf your car is equipped with a turbocharger, it is very likely that a failing turbocharger is causing the oil in the intake manifold. When the turbo fails, the seals or obstructed return line can lead to leaking oil.Usually, the oil ends up in the intercooler. However, it?s also possible to see some in the intake. 3. Oil Passage ClogWithin the engine, there are oil passages that the fluid must flow freely through. If one of the passageways is clogged in certain spots, oil could enter the manifold. This problem will also lead to a smoky engine. Plus, it?s not as simple to repair as the PCV valve. It?s best to keep the passageways clear, so this never becomes a problem. You do this by maintaining the engine with regular oil changes and by maintaining the filters. 4. Leaking Valve SealThe valve seals are needed to secure the valves within the cylinder heads. If the seals begin leaking, oil can make its way into the manifold.Again, you are going to deal with engine smoke when this happens. Most average at-home mechanics won?t want to handle this repair on their own.READ MORE: 6 Symptoms of a Bad Valve Seal (& Replacement Cost)5. Bad Piston RingThe piston rings are also needed to seal the cylinders within the motor. However, they can wear down over time.When this happens, oil leakage can occur. This oil could leak into the intake manifold, leading to a smoky engine once again. "
what are the Symptoms of Oil in Intake Manifold ?	"If there is oil in the intake manifold, you will notice distinct symptoms pointing to the problem. While I have discussed engine smoke, that isn?t the only possible symptom. Here are the most common characteristics of this problem:Of course, most of these problems can also occur with other faults, so it?s difficult to determine that these are caused by oil in the intake manifold. With these symptoms, you might also be dealing with dirty filters or low compression.The only way to know for sure is to have the system checked and diagnosed. If you don?t have the equipment or skills to perform a diagnosis, take your car to a professional mechanic. "
how to Repair Oil in Intake Manifold ?	"1. Clean/Repair PCV ValveThe easiest solution to getting oil out of the intake manifold will be if the PCV valve needs attention. In most cases, you can handle this job at home with minimal equipment. If you have an oil catch pan, some rags, a degreasing agent, and some time, you can get it done.Start by disconnecting the negative battery terminal, so there?s no chance of electrical hazards.Locate the PCV valve. It is usually located in the valve cover, depending on how new your vehicle is. With the PCV valve off, you can clean it. Use your degreaser to wipe down any oil that is on the valve. Make sure you also clean within the port and around the part. In some cases, just cleaning it is enough to get it working again. If that doesn?t work, you might need to replace it. However, the part shouldn?t cost you much more than $25, and you can put it on yourself. If you must pay for labor, there?s no reason to pay more than one hour.When all is said and done, use your degreaser to clean out the intake manifold too. Pay attention to any tight nooks that could be easily missed. Once you are confident that everything is clean, you can reattach your PCV valve. You also need to put the negative battery terminal back on before you head out on a test drive. 2. Replace TurbochargerIf you know that the turbocharger has failed, the only solution is to have it repaired or replaced. In general, you might spend $750 to $1,250 to have the turbocharger replaced.On the other hand, the issue might not require a complete replacement. If you have expertise with turbos, you might be able to repair it, depending on what failed. 3. Replace Valve SealIf the valve seals are leaking, you should be able to fix them at home with the right tools. If you need to have it professionally done, having all of the valve seals replaced can cost anywhere from $200 to $1,500. To get to the seals, you might have to remove the cylinder head from the motor. With that removed, you can inspect each of the valve seals for wear. If you notice the seals are worn, you will want to remove them. It is always best to replace all of the seals to avoid future trouble, depending on how much they are for your vehicle. Normally the cost is minimal if the cylinder head doesn?t need to be removed.4. Replace Piston RingThe most expensive fix is to replace the piston rings. This can cost you anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000, because the job is much more complicated than working with leaking valve seals.For this repair, you must remove the pistons from the cylinders. You will have identified the worn rings with a compression test prior to the repair. Once you?ve identified the worn rings, you can replace them. Just like the seals, it?s best to replace all the rings to ensure they are in good shape.5. Clean Oil PassagesIt is a cumbersome job to clean out the oil passages in the engine. It?s not something for the faint of heart, as it will take some time. Before you get started, you need to take off any parts that are on the front of the engine. You also need to drain the oil from the engine. Once that is done, you can use wire brushes to get into the passageways and clean them. If you aren?t sure what you are doing with the engine, you should never attempt to do this yourself. One small misstep can lead to engine damage, which becomes quite costly. "
What is a Fouled Spark Plug?	"A fouled spark plug is a spark plug that has become dirty or covered with substances that shouldn?t be on the surface. You might see carbon, fuel or oil on the plug, creating trouble with performance, fuel economy and starting the engine.A fouled spark plug can also become blistered if it has been in an overheating engine. Continuing to drive with fouled spark plugs can lead to other engine issues or catalytic converter failure. "
What Are The Symptoms Of A Fouled Spark Plug?	"The main symptoms of a fouled spark plug include:Contaminated spark plugDifficulty starting the engineMisfiring enginePoor fuel economyDecreased response when acceleratingRough idleStrange exhaust smellHere is a more detailed list of the signs of a fouled spark plug to look for:1. Contaminated PlugAs discussed above, a fouled spark plug isn?t going to look like a new one. If you put them side-by-side, you will clearly see the difference.However, most people aren?t pulling the plugs to look at them unless other problems are noticed. Therefore, this probably won?t be the first symptom you come to, but it will be the one that confirms the spark plug is fouled. 2. Difficulty Starting EngineSpark plugs are needed to get the engine started. If they are fouled, there?s going to be more difficulty cranking the engine over.You might notice the problem a little at a time. At first, it might take just a second longer but eventually fail to start completely if not repaired. 3. Misfiring EngineWhen the spark plug can?t help burn the fuel in the combustion chamber properly, misfiring is going to occur. This problem could start as a stumble or sputter, eventually getting worse.These problems can also be caused by a failing sensor. Either way, the Check Engine Light will usually come on when the misfiring starts. 4. Poor Fuel EconomyWhenever the car engine doesn?t operate perfectly, the fuel economy is going to drop. Because fouled spark plugs aren?t burning fuel efficiently, you will end up using more gas.Poor fuel economy can also be caused by a spark plug gap that?s too far apart or close when compared with factory specifications. In this case, you could simply adjust the gap. 5. Decreased Response When AcceleratingWith a solid-running engine, the motor is going to respond instantly when you step on the gas pedal. However, the worn-out spark plug may lead to trouble with responsiveness. Still, trouble accelerating can be caused by numerous factors, so you can?t just assume you are dealing with fouled spark plugs. Instead, you must perform a complete diagnosis to figure out what?s going on. 6. Rough IdleWhen operating normally, the engine is going to maintain a consistent RPM. You should get used to where it normally idles and the sound it creates.When the plugs are bad, the idle may start to drop off or surge unnecessarily. You might also notice unusual vibrations as the ECU tries to compensate for the failure. 7. Strange Exhaust SmellThe spark plugs are needed to ignite the fuel and air mixture in the combustion chamber. If the fuel isn?t being ignited properly, it?s going to make its way through the exhaust unburned. In this case, you may start to smell gasoline coming from the tailpipe of your vehicle. This condition is known as running rich and can also be caused by many other faults. "
what are the Causes of Fouled Spark Plugs ?	"Fouled spark plugs are usually caused by internal oil leaks into the combustion chamber, such as leaking valve seals or piston rings. It can also be due simply to age if they weren?t replaced when they were due after the service schedule.1. Oil Contamination in Combustion ChamberOne of the main reasons for the fouled plug is oil contamination. When oil leaks into the combustion chamber, the tip of the plugs gets contaminated, leading to failure.This problem occurs more often in older vehicles. However, you can catch the issue early on if you notice the vehicle is burning through oil faster than normal. 2. Carbon BuildupIf the insulator tip or electrodes of the spark plug are black with dry soot, the issue could be carbon buildup. However, the reasons behind the carbon buildup can vary.It?s possible that the air filter is dirty, leading to contamination. You could also be spending more time driving at slower speeds, changing how the combustion occurs. It also happens if the fuel injectors become dirty or you idle the vehicle excessively.3. Overheating EngineBy overheating the plug tips, you will cause them to fail prematurely. Overheating can occur for multiple reasons, but it most frequently occurs because the cooling system is failing. Additionally, pre-ignition leads to extra heat in the combustion chamber. When either of these situations occurs, not only will the spark plug electrode wear down quicker, but there will be other engine damage that might not be as simple to fix. 4. Wrong Plug GapThe spark plug must have the right gap to ensure the spark has an appropriate amount of space to jump. This calibration is different depending on what type of vehicle you drive. You can find the exact specifications in your service manual, but some spark plugs come pre-gapped.If the spark plugs are pre-gapped, you should still double-check the setting with your spark plug gap tool. If it?s not just right, there will be additional stress on the tip of the spark plug, leading to early erosion. You are also going to notice some strange engine performance issues. "
How to Fix Fouled Spark Plugs ?	"There are some instances where cleaning the spark plugs is a good idea. However, most people find that it?s not worth the time. If you are looking for a cheap solution and don?t mind giving it a try, you won?t be out anything. Of course, the cleaned-up spark plug won?t perform as well as a new one, but it might get you by. If you want to clean your spark plugs, follow these steps:Use a clean rag to wipe down the firing tip and plug surface.Use a quick-drying cleaner, such as brake cleaner or fuel injector cleaner. Spray it to the firing end of the plug and let it sit for ten minutes. With a wire brush, you can clean the deposits from the spark plug. Use your air compressor or a can of compressed air to blow off the spark plug and its firing end. Double-check the gap to the spark plug and adjust if necessary.If you don?t clean the spark plug properly, it can fail much sooner. Additionally, you want to figure out what?s causing the plugs to foul and correct that problem, or it will just continue. In most cases, it?s best to replace the spark plugs once they foul. For the minimal cost of spark plugs, you have better peace of mind knowing that everything is operating the way it should. It can also be faster to replace them with new plugs versus cleaning them. However, if your engine has an issue like burning oil, you need to fix this first. Otherwise, the plugs will end up fouled again quite quickly."
How Long Do Spark Plugs Last?	"Standard copper spark plugs might need to be replaced every 20,000 miles, while platinum or iridium plugs might last 60,000 miles. However, there are extended life, high-end iridium and double platinum plugs that are rated for 100,000 to 120,000 miles instead. Here is a more detailed list of how long spark plugs will last depending on the type of spark plug.1. Standard CopperCopper spark plugs are among the cheapest option on the market. They contain a center electrode that?s copper coated with nickel alloy. It?s the type with the largest diameter, requiring more voltage to create a spark.Additionally, the nickel alloy material isn?t durable because it?s soft. For this reason, you need to replace the copper spark plugs most frequently, even as often as every 20,000 miles. However, you should always check the owner?s manual or contact your authorized dealer for the spark plug service schedule for your particular engine type. See the bottom of the article for more information.2. Iridium/PlatinumSingle platinum plugs have a similar design to the copper plug, but the center electrode is made with a platinum disc that?s welded to the tip, so there?s no nickel alloy. These spark plugs will generate additional heat, allowing for less carbon buildup. If you drive a car with a coil-on-plug ignition, platinum is probably the chosen spark plug type, but they do cost a little more.Additionally, iridium spark plugs are more durable because iridium is a harder material. There?s less voltage needed to create a spark, which is why they are more expensive. In general, standard platinum or iridium spark plugs might last 60,000 miles or more. 3. Extended Life/Double Platinum If you are looking for maximum performance, you want high-end iridium or double platinum spark plugs instead. With the double platinum plug, you gain a premium coating on the ground and center electrodes, creating a more efficient spark. Both of these options are more reliable than anything else on the market. Depending on what manufacturer you choose, they could last 100,000 miles or more between changes, making them worth every penny. 4. SilverSilver spark plugs aren?t quite as common as the other options, but they are used. You might find them in a motorcycle, racing engines or older European vehicles. These spark plugs have electrodes that are coated in silver. This type is rated highly in terms of thermal conductivity, but they don?t last long. In fact, you might need to change these every 20,000 miles as well. It?s not advisable to put silver plugs in any vehicle that they aren?t intended for. These are only meant to be used in very specific vehicles, generally, those that are much older. However, you might be able to upgrade away from silver plugs if you drive a certain vehicle. Check with your local auto technician if you are unsure what?s compatible with your vehicle."
What are Spark Plugs?	"Spark plugs are an essential part of the combustion process in the gas-powered engine. These small components ignite the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber. Without spark plugs, the car engine wouldn?t start and it would have trouble running. Inside each cylinder, there is usually one spark plug. The tip looks like a bulb that plugs into the wire head, creating high voltage that sends energy to the engine. This charge can range from 40,000 to 100,000 volts, which is why there?s an insulator for added protection. On the outer tab, there?s an electrode. The space found between the electrode and hook is where the spark occurs, designed to ignite the mixture in the engine cylinder. Diesel engines don?t use spark plugs. Instead, these engines rely on the help of glow plugs, which have a different purpose. "
what are the Signs Spark Plugs Need to be Replaced ?	"1. Strange Engine Noises and MisfiresWhen the spark plugs get corroded or have carbon build up on the tips, you will start to hear a variety of noises. The pinging, rattling or knocking sounds can all be caused by the combustion process being interrupted. When the spark plug fires at the wrong time or is too weak, the engine will misfire and the sounds will become more consistent. It?s best to change the spark plugs at the first sign of trouble to avoid any future issues. However, before you change the plug, you might want to examine it. An improper gap can cause many of the same problems and this issue is simple to fix. 2. Hard StartSpark plugs are necessary for starting the gas engine. If they are worn or degraded, starting the engine can prove to be more difficult.Over time, the trouble starting the engine can get worse. If let go, the damaged spark plugs can keep the engine from starting at all, leaving you stranded. 3. Performance ReductionSpark plugs aren?t just used to get the engine started but also to keep it running. If the spark plugs are firing incorrectly or not completely, there will be noticeable issues with the performance.You might notice the trouble more when you are trying to accelerate. Otherwise, the drive could just seem more sluggish or unresponsive. The engine can also start misfiring, leading to a jerky drive. 4. Degraded Fuel EconomyWhen the performance of the engine degrades, you will see poor fuel economy too. This problem occurs because the engine isn?t running as efficiently as possible. With that wasted fuel also comes higher bills to handle your daily commute. As gas prices continue rising, you don?t want to add any more to your expenses. 5. Check Engine LightWhenever the car engine isn?t running correctly, the Check Engine Light can come on. This system is designed to detect any faults with the regular operation of the motor. Failing or worn spark plugs can trigger the warning, alerting you to the problem before things get worse.Additionally, if the engine starts to misfire, you will also see the Check Engine Light come on. However, if the engine light starts flashing, this is a sign of a more serious problem. You shouldn?t keep driving when this occurs or you could allow catastrophic damage. You may see error codes like P0300, P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304 when your spark plugs are bad."
why is important to check my spark plugs  ?	"It is important to check your spark plugs regularly as they play a vital role in the ignition process of your vehicle's engine. Spark plugs are responsible for igniting the air-fuel mixture inside the engine's cylinders, which in turn powers the vehicle. Over time, spark plugs can become fouled, damaged, or worn, which can cause a range of problems, including:Reduced Fuel Efficiency: Worn or damaged spark plugs can cause your engine to run less efficiently, resulting in decreased fuel economy and higher costs at the gas pump.Engine Misfires: Failing spark plugs can cause misfires, which can lead to engine shaking, rough idling, and poor acceleration.Starting Problems: If your spark plugs are not functioning correctly, your engine may have difficulty starting, especially in colder weather.Engine Damage: Faulty spark plugs can cause engine damage over time, including damage to the catalytic converter and other engine components.By checking your spark plugs regularly and replacing them as needed, you can ensure that your engine is running smoothly, efficiently, and reliably. A general rule of thumb is to check your spark plugs every 30,000 miles, or as recommended by your vehicle's manufacturer."
Conclusion	"Even if no other symptoms are noticed, it?s best to change the spark plugs at regular intervals. By following the manufacturer guidelines, you can avoid all of the other problems that were previously listed.If you aren?t sure how often this is, look at the recommendations given with the spark plugs. However, you must also factor in the type of vehicle you drive. Your local auto technician can give you an appropriate interval if you are lost. We recommend writing this maintenance recommendation in a book with the other appointments it should have. You can keep a notebook showing you what mileage to change the oil, replace the filters and replace the spark plugs. Every maintenance step you take ensures a better running engine down the road, so don?t procrastinate when it?s time."
what are the Symptoms Of A Clogged or Bad DPF Filter ?	"When the DPF filter gets blocked or clogged, the engine becomes weaker and a check engine light often shows on your dashboard. It can also lead to higher fuel consumption and create a hard-starting situation. Additionally, you may also notice strange smells or turbocharger issues.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or clogged diesel particulate filter (DPF) to look for:1. Check Engine LightThe first, and most common sign of a bad DPF is a check engine light on your dashboard. The diesel particulate filter uses sensors to measure the pressure and temperature before and after the DPF filter. If the pressure is not correct, the engine control module will light up the check engine light on your dashboard.If you see a check engine light on your dashboard, you need to scan the trouble code memory with a code scanner to figure out what?s wrong.2. Decreased Engine PerformanceWhen the DPF is blocked, the exhaust system becomes dramatically affected. The ability to remove the exhaust from the engine efficiently is hindered, causing there to be a backup in the system. With the backup, the engine starts to feel weak and sluggish. The more exhaust gases that build up, the slower new fuel can be pumped in, leaving you without the ability to accelerate normally. Plus, the engine will need to use more power to push out the excess gases. 3. Poor Fuel EfficiencyWith the engine not working efficiently, you will burn more fuel than normal. Part of the inefficiency comes from the blocked filter itself, causing more fuel to be pumped in to accomplish the same task. It?s also caused by the need for more fuel to get the desired results from your engine.With these problems, you are going to spend more money at the pump. As the cost of diesel continues to rise, you are sure to notice the difference. 4. Trouble StartingThe blocked DPF creates a buildup of exhaust gas in the engine. This trapped gas isn?t able to go anywhere, creating more pressure than normal. During this time, it becomes difficult to get the engine cranked over. In fact, the engine won?t want to start unless that pressure gets released. This problem is more of a safety design. If the engine starts with all that pressure inside, permanent damage could occur, leading to major repair bills. To save yourself this money, it?s best to clean the DPF before a blockage occurs. 5. Strange SmellsAs the exhaust gas builds up in the engine, it can lead to a noticeable odor. Not only is this annoying, but it can also be dangerous.Exhaust gases are not safe to breathe and they can be flammable, putting you at risk of a fire. Additionally, while these smells are occurring, it?s difficult to tell if something else is wrong.6. Turbocharger DamageWith a blockage in the exhaust system, you must also consider the health of the turbocharger. When the gas flow is hindered or slowed down, the temperatures can quickly rise. When the problem isn?t resolved promptly, the turbine housing also gets hotter.Left unchecked, the turbocharger becomes damaged. If the housing becomes damaged, leaks can occur and efficiency will drop. This problem can also cause the oil inside the turbocharger to carbonize, which becomes dangerous to the motor itself. "
Diesel Particulate Filter Location ?	"The diesel particulate filter (DPF) is part of the exhaust system in your diesel vehicle. You can find the filter sitting ahead of the NOx trap, otherwise known as the NOx storage catalytic converter. You will often find the DPF filter close to the exhaust manifold.It?s also found ahead of the exhaust pipe but will be found behind the first temperature sensor. To remove the filter, you will need a screwdriver to take off the surrounding grills and plates. After the plates are removed, there could also be some O-rings or other clamps to take off. "
Diesel Particulate Filter Function ?	"The diesel particulate filter is part of the exhaust system. It?s meant to trap particulate matter, such as ash and soot. The DPF is constructed with a substrate that is made from ceramic material. It forms a honeycomb structure that is effective at trapping debris.The diesel particulate filter is meant to capture and store the soot from the exhaust, so the diesel vehicle can have reduced emissions. This soot is burned off periodically to help regenerate the DPF. With this regeneration process, excess soot gets burned off and deposited back in the filter, reducing the harmful emissions and black smoke you are used to seeing from diesel models during acceleration. DPFs are now mandatory on all vehicles since 2007, as per EPA guidelines. These filters trap matter so the vehicle can adhere to strict emissions standards. "
what is the Diesel Particulate Filter Replacement Cost ?	"A brand-new diesel particulate filter can cost between $1,000 and $7,000. These new parts are never inexpensive, which is why it?s important to keep the system running properly. Instead of replacing it, most people choose to clean it for more life. Considering that the DPF doesn?t normally fail in a low-mileage vehicle, it makes more sense to clean it. After all, the cost of a new DPF could be more than the value of the vehicle itself. When properly maintained, the DPF shouldn?t need to be cleaned more than every 100,000 miles."
how to make DPF Filter Testing ?	"DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) testing involves checking the performance of the DPF to ensure that it is functioning correctly. Here are the steps to follow for DPF filter testing:Perform a Visual Inspection: Inspect the DPF for any physical damage, such as cracks or holes, that could affect its performance. Also, check for any signs of soot buildup or clogging.Check for Error Codes: Use an OBD-II scanner to check for any error codes related to the DPF system. Any error codes can provide an indication of the potential problem.Check Differential Pressure: Use a differential pressure gauge to check the pressure drop across the DPF. This test will provide an indication of how well the DPF is filtering out particulate matter. A high pressure drop across the DPF can indicate that it is becoming clogged and needs cleaning or replacement.Check the Ash Content: Use an ash content analyzer to check the amount of ash buildup in the DPF. Over time, ash can accumulate in the DPF and reduce its filtering efficiency. If the ash content is high, the DPF may need to be cleaned or replaced.Check the Temperature Sensors: Check the temperature sensors located before and after the DPF to ensure that they are functioning correctly. These sensors are used to monitor the DPF's performance and can help identify any potential issues.Check the Regeneration System: Check the DPF regeneration system to ensure that it is functioning correctly. The regeneration system is designed to burn off any accumulated soot in the DPF, and a malfunctioning system can lead to soot buildup and reduced filtering efficiency.It's important to note that DPF filter testing can be complicated and may require specialized equipment and knowledge. If you're not comfortable testing the DPF yourself, consider taking your vehicle to a mechanic or engine specialist for testing."
How to Clean a Diesel Particulate Filter ?	"1. ThermalIf you take the DPF to a professional for cleaning, you might hear them using the thermal method. This cleaning technique is also known as the ?bake and blow.?The DPF is put in an oven. With the heat raised, the soot is oxidized, while the airflow pushes the ash out of the filter. 2. AqueousThis other professional method has been shown to be effective. A surfactant surrounds the ash particles, making it easier for water to wash the debris away from the substrate.Once the substrate is cleaned, it must be dried completely. A special cabinet is needed, so you will have to wait at least two hours before it can be reinstalled. 3. At-Home CleanersIf you don?t want to take your vehicle to a professional for cleaning, you can try and do it yourself with a special additive. You can find some top brands for less than $25 per bottle. These products are meant to break down soot and ash. Follow all of the directions found on the back of the bottle. You will have to put it into the fuel tank with the engine running. Once it has been added, it?s best to drive for thirty minutes. This helps the additive circulate in the system. It doesn?t matter what speed you travel at ? it will work. Plus, the DPF warning light might disappear if it was previously on. While cleaning additives can break up some clogs, they are best used for maintenance. If you are using a cleaner every three to six months, you shouldn?t have any clogging issues down the road. If you are still having trouble after using an additive, you might need one of the professional cleaning methods instead. Visit your local diesel mechanic for more support."
Conclusion	"A clogged DPF filter can cause many problems for your car. If you notice any of the signs mentioned above, it is important to take action and replace or repair your DPF filter as soon as possible. A new DPF filter will help improve your car?s emissions, performance and fuel efficiency."
What is Throttle Body Service?	"Throttle body service involves cleaning the throttle blade and bore. Because the throttle is responsible for managing the airflow, any gunk or debris in the body can decrease power and acceleration. After cleaning, the engine should run smoother and cleaner. Most people choose to perform the throttle body cleaning in a home garage. There are special products designed for this task, so visiting a professional shop is only needed if you aren?t sure what to do."
How Often Should I Get Throttle Body Service?	"Some people recommend having the throttle body serviced every 75,000 miles, although most manufacturers don?t set a recommended interval. Instead, it?s important to consider the service any time you notice any symptoms that the throttle body is dirty.A physical inspection will reveal any grime buildup that needs to be dealt with. You should also notice some performance issues as the throttle body becomes contaminated. The idle might become higher or rough. The car may also struggle to accelerate. When the motor doesn?t run right, the Check Engine Light could come on and you could also notice decreased fuel economy numbers. "
Is Throttle Body Service Needed?	"If the car is running perfectly, the throttle body service is probably unnecessary. However, there are major benefits to keeping the throttle body clean. In your vehicle, there?s an air intake system. This system is responsible for pulling air into the combustion chamber from the environment around it. The air that?s pulled in gets mixed with fuel to ensure an appropriate balance for combustion.The throttle body helps to determine how much air is added to the fuel. If the throttle body becomes contaminated or dirty by carbon deposits, the right amount of air won?t be added, leading to an imbalance of the air-fuel ratio. Because of this, the engine will be rough, and you could spend more money than needed on fuel. Because it?s not difficult to clean the throttle body, it makes sense to add it to your regular maintenance plan. In fact, you can clean it yourself with the right products."
How to Clean the Throttle Body ?	"Here are a few steps of how to clean your throttle body at home. For the full guide check out: How to Clean a Throttle Body (10 Steps DIY)1. Prepare MaterialsBefore you start cleaning the throttle body, you have to choose the right products. You can find a variety of throttle-body cleaners online, so you should always read through the customer reviews to determine what?s best.Additionally, you want to gather some protective gear. I recommend having gloves and eye protection. It?s also helpful to wear clothing that covers your body, as the products can irritate your skin. Before you move on, make sure the vehicle is parked on level ground. You also want to be outside, since the products are flammable. If you are working in the daytime, there should be plenty of light to complete the job. 2. Find the Throttle BodyYou can locate the throttle body between the air cleaner and intake manifold. It is typically made from aluminum or another metal. If you are having trouble locating it, ask a friend to push down on the accelerator while the motor is off. Because the throttle body contains a direct connection with the gas pedal, you should see a movement of the shaft, which helps to identify it. 3. Remove Air DuctBefore you do anything else, take off the battery?s ground terminal to ensure safety. You also need to remove the hoses and electrical wires that are attached to the throttle body, but you want to label them so you know where they go.The next step is to remove the air duct. It is usually connected with a clamp, which should be easy to remove with a Phillips or Torx screwdriver. Don?t take off any wires that are connected. If you aren?t able to remove the air ducts, you should stop. It?s best to have a professional perform the cleaning in these circumstances. 4. Spray CleanerWith your protective gear like rubber gloves and safety glasses on, you are ready to spray your cleaner into the air duct of the throttle body. You can also use a brush to scrub out deposits and dirt. With some paper towels, you can wipe the surface clean. If it?s hard to see inside, use a flashlight. It?s also helpful to have a cotton swab, which will get into tight places. You can put the cleaner right on the cotton swab. If you spill any of the cleaner, you want to wipe it up with paper towels.5. Reassemble VehicleOnce the throttle body is clean, it?s time to put everything back together. Reconnect all of the ducts that were previously removed. You must also tighten the clamps to ensure security.Clean up all of your tools and reconnect the car battery. Dispose of your safety equipment and dirty paper towels properly. Once you have cleaned up, go ahead and start the vehicle. It might not run perfectly at first, as there can be a readjustment period.6. Take Test DriveIt?s important to give the car time to warm up. It?s recommended to let the engine idle for about five minutes before taking a test drive.During the test drive, you should see some changes to how the engine runs. There?s also the chance that you won?t notice anything at all, especially if you performed regular maintenance just to stay on top of the grime and dirt buildup. It all depends on how dirty and clogged the throttle body was to begin with."
what are the Causes of RPM Fluctuation While Driving?	"Many RPM fluctuations are caused by transmission problems. It can also happen when the spark plugs are dirty or if there is a vacuum leak that causes misfires. In some cases, the crankshaft position sensor may send the wrong engine speed signal to the tachometer.Here is a more detailed list of the causes of RPM fluctuation while driving.1. Defective TransmissionThe transmission handles all of the gear shifting. If there?s a problem with the automatic transmission, the shifting could become irregular or delayed. If you drive a manual transmission vehicle, the clutch could also be slipping.It?s also possible that there?s a transmission leak. When the fluid levels fall below normal, the engine could rev at higher levels because the torque converter will not function properly. 2. Malfunctioning Crankshaft Position SensorA faulty crankshaft sensor affects the engine timing negatively. As it controls the timing, the RPMs will fluctuate. Also, the engine control module and the tachometer (RPM) on your dashboard use the crankshaft position sensor to measure the engine speed. If there is something wrong with the engine crankshaft position sensor or the wirings, you can see a fluctuating RPM speed.You might also notice that the bad crankshaft sensor causes stalling, trouble starting, and added vibration. Get this problem repaired before you are left stranded. Some car models use the camshaft position sensor, so it shouldn?t be overlooked. Use an OBD2 scanner and look for any related trouble codes.3. Fouled Spark Plugs or CoilsThe spark plugs are used to ignite the air and fuel mixture entering the combustion chamber. Once the plugs are worn, engine misfires can occur, leading to engine vibration.This vibration can cause RPM fluctuations, and it will feel like the engine has a mind of its own. You may also notice poor acceleration, a drop in fuel economy, and jerking. Spark plugs may need to be replaced as early as 30,000 miles, depending on what type you choose. You also want to take a look at the ignition coils, as these ignite the spark plugs and are known to fail quite often due to the engine heat. If you have an older car, you want to check the distributor cap and the spark plug wires instead.4. Vacuum LeakIt?s always possible that the fluctuation has to do with an engine vacuum leak, especially if it occurs while accelerating. When there?s a vacuum leak, the engine?s air supply gets interrupted. You might notice RPM fluctuation, as well as reduced fuel efficiency, the Check Engine Light, a rough idle and a hissing noise. A vacuum leak can cause the vehicle to stall, leaving you stranded, so don?t wait to get it looked at. Vacuum leaks are normally found around the intake manifold and are often caused by cracked vacuum hoses. It can also be a leaking intake manifold gasket between the cylinder head and the intake manifold.5. Dirty Fuel InjectorsFuel injectors allow the engine to receive the fuel needed to run properly. However, over time, debris and dirt can clog the injectors. When this happens, the fuel delivery is obstructed, leading to starvation of the engine.Not only will clogged injectors cause fluctuating RPMs, but the car can also become jerky. It may also not accelerate the way you expect it to. However, bad spark plugs and vacuum leaks create many of the same symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose. 6. Bad Throttle Position SensorIf you have a bad TPS, the car can accelerate on its own with an electric throttle body, whether you are pushing on the gas pedal or not. This creates an RPM fluctuation that becomes noticeable. Additional symptoms include misfiring and trouble to start the engine. As the problem gets worse, you might not be able to get the car moving, so don?t overlook the problems.It can also be the throttle body itself that is damaged. It might also just be dirty; it can often be cleaned without replacing it. Another reason may be the pedal position sensor, which sends electrical signals to the throttle control on how much acceleration to apply. This is not very common, but it should not be overlooked.7. Dirty Air FilterThe fuel inside the combustion chamber must mix with the appropriate amount of air to create power. The air filter traps contaminants, ensuring that the air entering the engine is clean. If the filter isn?t changed, it can become clogged, which stops air from entering the engine. Not only will this cause engine RPM fluctuations, but it can also lead to a delay in accelerating. Thankfully, it?s one of the easiest fixes to perform. 8. Bad tachometer (RPM meter)Although it is quite rare for the tachometer to be damaged, it can happen on some car models, so it should not be overlooked. The tachometer is integrated into the instrument cluster of modern cars, so if it is damaged, you may need to replace the entire cluster.But since it is so rare that the tachometer is bad and a new cluster is quite expensive, you should look at the wirings and look for other problems with a code scanner first."
How to Fix RPM Fluctuation ?	"At the first sign of RPM fluctuation, you want to have the problem looked at. If you are mechanically inclined, there?s no need to visit a shop unless you can?t complete the repair. If the Check Engine Light is on, you want to start by reading the diagnostic trouble codes to see if that shows you the problem. A quick tune-up might be in order to get the car running right again. You can change the spark plugs, swap out the air filter and possibly add a fuel injector cleaner to see what happens. However, some of the other problems are tough to diagnose and more difficult to repair. You will need special tools to diagnose and repair a vacuum leak, transmission problems and issues with the sensors. In these cases, it might be best to visit your local auto repair shop."
What are RPMs?	"RPM means Revolutions Per Minute. When the car accelerates or decelerates, the engine?s crankshaft rotates. The RPMs measure these rotations in conjunction with how quickly the pistons are going up and down in the cylinders. You can view the RPMs on the car?s tachometer, usually sitting next to the speedometer. When you are accelerating, the RPMs naturally increase. On the other hand, the RPMs decrease when you release the accelerator. The majority of engines rev up to 4,000 to 6,000 RPMs before shifting when operating normally, but this value depends on what type of vehicle and the motor that?s installed."
What are Normal Idle RPM Values?	"When your car is idling, there shouldn?t be any surging or fluctuating, either. Normally, the idle speed should be somewhere between 500 and 1,000. If you are used to driving your car, you will get accustomed to what?s normal for your particular model. If you are noticing a rough idle, it could be due to many of the problems listed above. However, it could also be due to a defective idle air control valve (IAC) valve that controls the airflow during idle. "
What Causes Lower RPMs?	"If the RPMs seem low and they are fluctuating, you might be looking at a dirty throttle body, defective spark plugs or a clogged air filter. It?s also possible that there?s a vacuum leak, which would create misfiring situations, too.Go through the diagnostic steps listed above. You don?t want to ignore the low RPMs, because it can quickly cause engine stalling. "
What Causes Higher RPMs?	"If the RPMs are surging higher than normal or even to the red line, there could be multiple issues occurring. The most obvious thought is that there is a transmission problem, but you don?t want to overlook simpler issues. We recommend performing a tune-up first to see if that resolves the problem. After that, you will have to start more extensive diagnostic procedures. "
Cost to Repair Engine RPM Fluctuations ?	"The repair cost varies depending on what you need to fix. You could spend $50 to $100 to perform a DIY tune-up that might resolve the problem. On the other hand, there are some more expensive engine repairs you could be looking at. For example, replacing the throttle position sensor could cost $150 to $250, while the crankshaft position sensor replacement could be $175 to $275. Additionally, finding and repairing a vacuum leak or having the transmission worked on could easily break the bank. If your car isn?t worth a lot of money, it might be time to get something newer."
What is a Muffler Delete?	"A muffler delete refers to removing the muffler(s) from your car?s exhaust system. A muffler serves as a resonator to reduce the noise coming from the engine. Many car models have two or more mufflers on the exhaust system which can be removed as desired.You can also choose to create a straight pipe exhaust system, but that requires removing the muffler and the catalytic converter. While the two services are often talked about as the same procedure, the straight pipe exhaust requires more modifications.As said, many exhaust pipes have two or more mufflers, so which or how many you want to remove is up to you."
Muffler Delete Pros ?	"1. Increased HorsepowerRemoving the muffler won?t increase horsepower in all vehicles. However, it can make a significant improvement on many older cars. Cars with large engines or high power from the factory are more likely to get a boost by removing the muffler(s).The mufflers on older vehicles can be restrictive. They also increase the engine backpressure, which isn?t good for the motor anyway. By taking the muffler out of the equation, you can easily increase the top-end horsepower and further protect the engine. 2. Aggressive Exhaust NoteSure, the muffler delete is going to help the older engine, but it doesn?t provide any performance benefits for most newer models if your car doesn?t have a lot of horsepower. Instead, it?s done solely to change the tone coming from the car.When the muffler is removed, you get a more aggressive note coming from the exhaust. Considering the muffler reduces the noise coming from the engine, taking it off is going to accent the tone better. "
Muffler Delete Cons ?	"1. Loud ExhaustWhile this point was also an advantage, it can go either way for some people. The loud exhaust might sound exciting at first, but it can get old very quickly. If you plan on taking long road trips with the family, be prepared not to hear one another.As you push the car into higher RPMs, the sound gets even louder. The more air that comes through the exhaust, the louder it is going to be. It doesn?t take long for this noise to get annoying. 2. IllegalIf you remove the muffler from your vehicle, you might be breaking the law. Check your local laws to see what the regulations are.However, most cops aren?t going to pull you over for not having a muffler on. Still, they have every right to, especially if you are violating any local noise ordinances. 3. Reduces Engine PerformanceBy now, you are wondering why the disadvantages contradict the advantages. Yes, increasing engine performance was listed as a benefit, but only on older and high-powered vehicles.With a newer car with a smaller engine, removing the muffler can actually sometimes cause the opposite effect. The automaker created the ECM to work in conjunction with the muffler. If you remove it, you might notice worse performance. It?s also possible that the Check Engine Light could come on. 4. Failed EmissionsThirty-four states now require emissions testing. If you live in one of these states and you remove the catalytic converter, your vehicle isn?t going to pass the test. It can also cause the Check Engine Light to come on, which might cause you to automatically fail.However, just removing the muffler shouldn?t cause failed emissions. Still, if an inspection is performed, the technicians could fail your vehicle. To pass the vehicle, you will have to put the muffler back on, which defeats the purpose of taking it off in the first place. "
How Much Does a Muffler Delete Cost? 	"The average cost for a muffler delete is between $150 and $450. You should only spend between $50 and $200 on the parts. If you can do the job yourself, you won?t spend anything on labor. Otherwise, expect to spend about $100 to $250. It can be difficult to find someone to perform a muffler delete. In most cases, removing the muffler is illegal, so it?s hard to find someone willing to participate in the modification. "
Aspects Determining Muffler Delete Cost ?	"1. Car StyleWhen you remove the muffler, you will still need to add a pipe to the exhaust system to connect it to the tailpipe. The parts needed for this depend on what type of car you drive. Additionally, the labor is going to be based on your type of vehicle. For example, if your car has a sophisticated exhaust system, the cost could be much higher than one that is straightforward. 2. Exhaust Pipe TypeThere are different types of exhaust pipes you can choose from. While you can get a mild steel pipe if you want to save money, it?s often better to spend a little more on stainless steel or, in some cases, even titanium.These pipes hold up better. While they will cost more upfront, you shouldn?t need to replace them any time soon, thereby giving you a better value. 3. LaborLabor rates vary based on where you live and what type of shop you are visiting. You can see a big difference in hourly rates based on what?s quoted in the city versus the country. Additionally, the type of shop you visit makes a difference. Expect to pay more if you visit an exhaust shop versus your traditional auto repair location. "
DIY Muffler Delete ?	"1. Check Local LawsBefore you do anything with your exhaust, you want to research your state and local laws. In most cases, these modifications are illegal, so you want to understand what laws you are breaking before you do anything.These local laws also make it difficult to find an automotive technician willing to remove the muffler. Maybe that?s why you are trying to do it yourself in the first place. Otherwise, performing your own muffler delete helps you save money. 2. Jack the Car UpYou need to get under the car with plenty of room to move around. To do this, you will place it up on a jack with jack stands.Put the jack under the designated area laid out in the service manual. Jack up the car to an appropriate height and place jack stands underneath the vehicle to support it. 3. Remove Exhaust ClampsThe muffler is attached to the exhaust with the help of special clamps. These U-shaped clamps need to be removed if you want to take the muffler off. However, these clamps are often rusted, making them nearly impossible to remove.Before you get started, spray the nuts with WD-40 or another lubricating chemical. If you leave the solution soak on the nuts, it could make it easier to remove them. There are times when the only way to remove the muffler is to cut it. If the exhaust pipe has been welded in place, cutting it could be your only option. 4. Connect TailpipeWhen you add an exhaust pipe, you need to choose what type of material you want to use. You could spend less on mild steel pipes. However, a stainless steel pipe is going to provide more corrosion resistance. You won?t spend that much more to get one made from stainless steel, and the investment is worth the cost.You don?t always need to add an exhaust pipe. It depends on what kind of system your car has. However, adding an exhaust pipe can help to improve the performance of your vehicle. In most cases, a straight pipe needs to be connected to the exhaust pipe. This setup should provide all of the functions needed, but the measurements could be different, depending on what type of car you have.You may need a 90-degree exhaust adapter to connect your new exhaust pipe to the old one. Take your time to clamp the pipes together. If you prefer a permanent application, you may choose to weld the pipes to the exhaust. However, this is more difficult to change in the future, especially if you need to add something to pass an emissions test."
what are the Causes for Milky Oil on the Dipstick  ?	"When the oil dipstick becomes milky white, it means that water has mixed with it. As the two substances mix together, a white sludge is created. Because water should never be present in the engine, you must take a closer look at what?s causing the problem, as it could be related to a blown head gasket. Here is a more detailed list of the reasons why your car?s oil dipstick is milky:1. Condensation or Moisture There are certain parts of the country that deal more heavily with damp and humid conditions. In these areas, it?s possible for moisture to build up in the motor. You might first spot this problem by watching the exhaust gases because water vapor will be produced. In normal operating conditions, the engine gets to regular temperatures and the moisture is burnt off. However, not everyone drives their vehicles far enough to get the motor this warm, leading to the moisture sitting in the engine. When the condensation goes unchecked, it can create a milky white substance on the dipstick. Additionally, you might have gotten water into the motor when you were cleaning the engine bay. If you use a pressure washer, it?s possible you got water into the oil. It can also get into the power steering cap or through the air filter, none of which is good. 2. Blown Head GasketIf you know anything about engine problems, you know this is one condition you don?t ever want to face. If moisture can?t be blamed for the milky white residue on the dipstick, you might have a blown head gasket. The role of the head gasket is to keep the cylinders protected with an airtight seal. With this seal, the cylinders operate as intended because there?s the right amount of compression. This gasket is also needed to keep the oil and coolant separated, even though both can be found in the motor. When the head gasket blows, coolant starts leaking into the oil passages or into the combustion chamber. What you are left with is the white, milky substance on the dipstick. A blown head gasket will create other symptoms that you can look for. You might notice white smoke coming from the exhaust or the engine could start overheating. It?s also possible to spot bubbles in the coolant overflow tank or radiator. If you are refilling the coolant but have yet to find an external leak occurring, it?s possible that the fluid is infiltrating the oil passages instead. 3. Faulty Oil/Coolant Heat ExchangerSome car engines have a heat exchanger installed that maintains the oil temperature using the coolant temperature. Sometimes a gasket of these heat exchangers gives up, or a crack inside the exchanger itself. This will result in a milky oil on your dipstick.However, most car models do not have this part so you should check your repair manual or reasearch more if your engine is equipped with one."
how to Fixe for Milky Oil on Dipstick ?	"1. Take Longer DrivesIf there?s nothing wrong with the motor, you can burn off the moisture that might be inside the engine. By simply adding some time to your normal short trips, you can get that condensation to go away quickly.For drives under ten minutes, it?s possible that the engine never reaches the right operating temperature, especially if you are just casually driving through town. Instead, you want to put a little more time into your drive. I recommend taking the long way to your next destination, especially if you don?t plan to drive again for some time. You also want to try and get the speeds up to 60 mph, which will run the condensation out quicker than if you are driving 25 mph. 2. Wash Engine CarefullyIf you want to wash out the engine bay, you can do it yourself, but there must be some caution involved. You don?t want to get any water into the engine, or it can cause massive damage. Before you get started, pop the oil cap off and check the seal. If the seal is worn, it can?t stop water from getting into the engine, and you should replace it first.With the seal in great shape, it?s time to spray down the motor, but make sure you use a low-pressure setting. It?s okay to use your household pressure washer, but it should be set as low as possible to get the job done. However, don?t ever spray on the engine seals directly, because these aren?t meant for this level of pressure. Otherwise, you could use an engine degreaser to get the surface clean. With a scrub brush and cleaner, you should be able to wipe away any debris. Plus, you only need a small stream of water to rinse it away, so there?s no chance of getting oil inside the motor. 3. Repair Blown Head Gasket or Heat ExchangerDiagnosing a heat exchanger can be quite tricky without the right knowledge. Research if there are more people with the same engine suffering from the same issue online. If there are many reports of failed exchangers on your car engine model, it could be the same on yours. To diagnose the heat exchanger, you either have to remove it completely and check the gaskets or use a pressure tester.Once the head gasket fails, there aren?t many more options to consider. You can find a wide variety of head gasket sealers on the market. Many people advise not to use these, and it?s important that you decide what?s best for your car. But it?s unlikely that you will be in a worse situation from using one, so it might be worth trying. Otherwise, you need a new head gasket. While the part is only about $125 to $350, the labor adds a whole bunch of money to the bill. Depending on what type of vehicle you have and the area you live in, you could put out another $650 to $1,750 in labor costs. Plus, you will be without your vehicle for at least a few days while it is being worked on. If your vehicle isn?t worth the fix, it?s time to start car shopping."
What does a milky or white sludge under the oil cap mean?	"The white or milky substance indicates that moisture or water is mixing with the motor oil. It turns into a creamy white sludge that sticks to the cap. Water shouldn?t enter the engine or mix with the oil, so it should lead to a closer inspection, but you may not need to worry. There are legitimate reasons that water got into the engine that won?t lead to a major repair. However, the most troublesome concern is always a blown head gasket, which requires an engine rebuild or replacement to repair. "
what are the Causes for White Buildup Under Oil Filler Cap ?	"1. Moisture/Condensation BuildupCondensationIf you reside in a location dealing with damp and cold temperatures, moisture can build up in the engine. You will first spot this condensation by looking at the exhaust, which will create water vapor as a byproduct. Many people mistake a milky oil cap with a blown head gasket, which could be true, but the majority of times it?s just normal condensation.However, as the engine warms up, this moisture should be naturally removed. Evaporation should occur once the engine is running at optimal temperatures. If you aren?t driving your vehicle long enough for the temperatures to rise this high, the water can?t be burned off. What?s left behind is an accumulation of white gunk under the oil filler cap.2. Poor Cleaning HabitsPressure Wash Car EngineAre you using high-pressure power washers to clean your vehicle? If you use the same pressure washer to clean out the engine bay, you might see milky oil under the cap. The high-pressure spray can push water into the engine, where it doesn?t belong. If water mixes with the oil, it can build up on the oil filler cap. The water can also infiltrate the air filter, the engine oil dipstick, the power steering cap and other locations. 3. Blown Head GasketHead Gasket On EngineThis is the problem no one wants to deal with. If you are sure that the milky white substance isn?t being caused by bad practices or anything else external to the engine, it?s probable that you are dealing with a blown head gasket instead. The head gasket has an important job. It?s designed to keep the cylinders behind an airtight seal for maximum performance. With this seal, the cylinders can perform their regular duties. Plus, the seal creates the right amount of compression for the engine to run smoothly. It also keeps the coolant and oil from mixing together, even though they are both flowing through the engine. When the head gasket is blown, the coolant can leak into the engine?s combustion chamber. It will infiltrate the engine oil passages, leading to a milky white substance building up on the bottom of the oil filler cap. You can check for a blown head gasket by looking closer at the oil dipstick. Allow the car to run until the engine reaches optimal running temperatures. You can also look at the exhaust during this time because a blown head gasket creates white smoke.Check the dipstick to see what it looks like. If all you see is engine oil, you might not have a blown head gasket. However, if there is moisture or milky oil showing up on the dipstick and a white substance on the oil cap, you can safely assume that the head gasket is the problem. There are other signs of a blown head gasket to consider during your troubleshooting stage. There could be coolant leaking from below the exhaust manifold of the engine. You could also see bubbles forming in the radiator or coolant overflow tank.If you keep having to refill the coolant but you can?t find a leak, that strongly indicates that you are dealing with a blown head gasket, because the coolant is leaking internally. If left unchecked, the blown head gasket is going to cause overheating problems since the system isn?t working as it should."
how to  Fixe for White Buildup Under Oil Cap ?	"1. Drive LongerTest DriveIf you can?t find anything mechanically wrong, the problem could simply be due to excessive moisture that?s not burning off. This is especially true if you aren?t taking long trips in your vehicle.If you only drive for five or ten minutes, the engine temperature never reaches optimal ranges. Evaporation can?t occur, which allows moisture to build up in the engine. Not only is this bad for the motor, but it will also lead to a milky buildup.However, the fix is a simple one and it can be fun. Take your car out for longer drives. If you plan to go somewhere ten minutes away, take a long way and enjoy the scenery. You want to also make sure you are driving at a higher speed whenever possible. The engine warms up faster when you drive 60 mph versus driving down a back road at 15 mph. 2. Clean Engine ProperlyWash Engine ProperlyWhen you wash the car engine, you need to be careful that water doesn?t get into the motor. For starters, check the oil cap seal before you get started. If it is damaged or worn-out, it won?t provide a barrier for moisture, so you should replace it. Once you?ve confirmed that the seal is in good shape, you want to spray down the engine bay with a low-pressure stream of water. You can still use the pressure washer, but be sure to turn it down a notch. Additionally, take care that you don?t spray directly on the engine seals, especially around the valve cover. The best way to clean the engine is to get a special cleaner and scrub it on with a brush. Once you?ve removed the grime and dirt, you can use a normal spray of water to simply rinse it off, thereby keeping it protected from the excessive pressure that?s not needed. 3. Repair Head GasketHead Gasket ReplacementIf the head gasket fails, you don?t have a lot of options. Some people claim that head gasket sealers work well, but a lot of people tell you never to use one. Before you do, make sure you do your own research so you know what you are getting into. Of course, if you need a new head gasket anyway, it probably won?t do any more damage.The new head gasket is only going to cost you $100 to $300, depending on what type of car you drive. While this isn?t expensive, it?s the labor that could break the bank. Depending on what vehicle you drive and where you take it for repair, you could easily spend $750 to $2,000, if not more.Additionally, the fix can take some time, so you will be without your vehicle for daily transportation until the shop is finished. If the vehicle isn?t worth this type of repair, it might be time to start looking for a new car instead."
Does a milky oil cap always mean a blown head gasket?	"No. A milky oil cap doesn?t always mean a blown head gasket, although it potentially could. In many cases, the oil cap is milky due to normal condensation from the engine. When the engine is running, the heat creates condensation that will end up on the oil cap and give it a milky appearance."
Does synthetic oil look milky?	"No. Neither synthetic oil nor other new motor oils for cars should look milky. They will almost always have a clear yellowish color. If your oil looks milky, there is a risk that oil is mixing with water, which can be caused by a blown head gasket if you are unlucky."
Can condensation cause a milky oil cap?	"Yes. The most common cause of a milky oil cap is actually normal condensation from the engine. However, if you see that the oil cap is milky, you?ll want to check the engine oil dipstick to make sure it?s not milky. If so, it may be due to a bad head gasket."
How do you fix a milky oil cap?	"In most cases, you can fix a milky oil cap just by cleaning it. A milky oil cap can occur with normal condensation. Therefore, it is very likely that a normal cleaning will work, but if the oil cap turns milky again or you also have a milky dipstick, you could be looking at more serious problems."
Conclusion	"From my experience in the repair shop, I have met hundreds of people who think their head gasket is blown just because of a milky oil cap, but in the end it was just normal condensation. You shouldn?t fear the worst just because your oil cap is milky.However, there is always a risk that the head gasket is blown and you can often tell this by checking the dipstick to ensure it is not milky. If you see that the dipstick is milky also, take immediate action and check the head gasket."
Do Diesel Engines Have Catalytic Converters?	"Yes. Many diesel cars have a catalytic converter, but not in the same way that a gas-powered car does. Some diesel engines contain a two-way catalytic converter with a diesel oxidization catalyst, but it could be a three-way design that adds an SCR reduction. Diesel engine emissions go through four stages: there?s the EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation), as well as the DPF (Diesel Particulate Filtration), plus the DOC (Diesel Oxidization Catalyst) and the SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction). The catalysts produce chemical reactions to reduce harmful emissions in the DOC and SCR stages."
How Does the Diesel Catalytic Converter Work?	"The diesel catalytic converter is responsible for converting harmful substances into forms that are non-toxic. Inside the metal casing are two ceramic blocks that contain thousands of micro-cellular units, looking like a honeycomb. All of the ceramic blocks have a metal coating, such as platinum or palladium. The catalytic converter is located closer to the engine, with the converter heating up to catalyze the chemical reactions. These reactions convert toxic gases into harmless byproducts that can be released into the atmosphere.The Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) is very similar in function to the equivalent part in a gas engine. Carbon monoxide is reduced to water and carbon with the help of metal catalysts. During this time, the volatile hydrocarbons and byproducts are broken down into less harmful substances, so the emissions of dangerous gases are reduced. However, this cat doesn?t contain rhodium like it would if it were in a gas engine. It also includes a diesel particulate filter (DPF) that eliminates particulate matter that isn?t found in a converter equipped to a gas-powered engine.The SCR is responsible for breaking down the Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) into Nitrogen and Oxygen with the help of an ammonia-based catalyst. This open-loop system can reduce NOx emissions by 75 to 90 percent. SCR is also needed to reduce hydrocarbon emissions, but is only about eight percent effective. Using low sulfur fuel helps improve performance. "
How Long Does A Diesel Catalytic Converter Last?	"A diesel catalytic converter can last for 100,000 miles or about ten years. However, its health depends on how long your trips are and how the vehicle is treated. If you regularly take shorter trips, the catalytic converter could wear out prematurely. During shorter trips, the engine gets turned off before the converter can obtain the appropriate operating temperature to catalyze the compounds. The more often this occurs, the more wear the converter deals with. "
what are the Signs of a Failed Diesel Catalytic Converter ?	"If you recognize the signs that the converter is failing, you can have it replaced and not miss a beat. There are a couple of reasons the converter can fail early. A few of the most common causes for premature failure include:Free flow of exhaust gases is restrictedBuild-up of carbon depositsPhysical damageOverheatingPoor engine maintenanceMost modern cars use oxygen sensors that help determine if the catalytic converter is in need. When the oxygen sensors don?t receive the proper reading, they cause the Check Engine Light to come on. You can use a code scanner to figure out what?s causing the issue."
Diesel Catalytic Converter Replacement Cost ?	"Having the catalytic converter replaced isn?t going to be an inexpensive job. It?s just as expensive or more expensive than with a gas-powered car. On average, you can expect to spend between $900 and $2,500, based on your car model and the material of the converter. This estimate includes both parts and labor.If you are able to do the replacement yourself, you could save a small amount of money. However, the majority of the costs are made up of the part itself. Because of how much it costs to get a new catalytic converter, some drivers choose to put theft-proof features on it to prevent it from being stolen. For $50 or less, you can easily keep the catalytic converter protected from thieves. "
Can the Car Run Without a Diesel Catalytic Converter?	"There?s nothing stopping the vehicle from driving with the catalytic converter missing. The engine is still going to work and you won?t be stranded without it. However, the emissions standards won?t be the same and you could notice some engine performance problems.Additionally, catalytic converters are required by law. If you run your vehicle without one, you could face some stiff fines. You aren?t responsible for getting an emissions test, so that?s not the problem, but the safety inspection could flag it when you go to renew your registration."
Does Catalytic Converter Cleaning Work?	"As carbon builds up inside the catalytic converter, it can become clogged. Some people assume this means that the only option is to replace the catalytic converter, but that?s not the case. There are products that claim to clean the catalytic converter. While there?s a lot of controversy over whether these catalytic cleaner products work, most people agree that it?s worth trying. Paying a small amount for a simple cleaner could save you from needing to put on a new converter.Additionally, some people find that using a catalytic converter cleaner can help maintain the life of this valuable part. While many of the products will recommend using a bottle every 3,000 to 4,000 miles, this guideline is overkill. You should be able to see results if you use it twice a year while driving the average amount of miles."
How Much Does a Catalytic Converter Replacement Cost?	"The average catalytic converter replacement cost is between $400 and $2,500, for the parts and labor. However, it?s not the labor that costs so much. Rather, the catalytic converter will make up most of the cost, mainly because of the expensive materials used in the interior construction of the part. Catalytic converter replacement can be one of the most expensive auto repair tasks. Depending on the value of your car, it might not be worth replacing the catalytic converter. However, you can prevent the need for a new catalytic converter by maintaining your vehicle. If you get the spark plugs changed regularly and keep the engine running its best, the catalytic converter will continue working as it was intended. It?s when you neglect your vehicle?s care that the catalytic converter starts to fail. If the Check Engine Light comes on, take it seriously and have it looked at."
Factors that Affect Catalytic Converter Replacement Cost ?	"1. Vehicle TypeIf you drive an older car, you might spend less to replace the catalytic converter. Older vehicles have cheaper catalytic converters, possibly only costing a few hundred dollars.However, newer cars contain more sophisticated catalytic converters, which drastically increases the price. Additionally, if your vehicle has a dual exhaust system, there might be two catalytic converters to deal with. 2. Quality of New PartAs with any auto part, no two are created the same. You can find a generic catalytic converter that will get the job done, but it might not provide the best fit or superior materials. A cheap catalytic converter won?t have the same level of precious metals inside, making it less efficient and not as durable. You will be replacing the catalytic converter again in the future. The higher-end catalytic converter can contain a density of six times the amount of materials when compared with a cheaper option. You may also notice a check engine light together with the P0420 code on your dashboard if you install a cheap catalytic converter.3. Labor ExpensesAs with any auto repair, the labor expense factors into what you will spend. If you can do the job yourself, you might save some money. However, replacing a catalytic converter isn?t normally a job to be done in a home garage. It?s possible that the old catalytic converter needs to be cut off and the new one could be welded in place. If you have a dual exhaust, you must perform the task twice.Additionally, labor rates are different within every region. If you live in a city, you might spend more than your countryside neighbors. You will also pay more to visit a dealership or specialized exhaust shop over using your local auto repair garage. Evaluate the pricing around you, but don?t choose a shop based on the cheapest rates. If the job takes them twice the time to complete the task, you could actually end up spending more. 4. Other Diagnostics/RepairsWhen you take your vehicle to the auto repair shop, you have more expenses than just getting the catalytic converter replaced. You will also need to pay for any relevant diagnostic charges.Aside from that, if there are other issues with the exhaust system, those repairs could also be added in. It?s possible for multiple systems or parts to fail at the same time, especially if another fault has caused the catalytic converter to go bad. "
what are the Symptoms of Bad Catalytic Converter ?	"Here is a brief of the most common symptoms you may notice. However, check our other article down below if you want a more detailed guide: 8 Symptoms of a Bad Catalytic Converter1. Failed Emissions TestThirty-four states now require emissions testing. Sometimes the first sign that drivers recognize something is wrong is when the car fails its emissions test.When the catalytic converter isn?t working right, the emissions aren?t going to be ideal for the environment. Because additional gases are getting pumped into the atmosphere, you won?t be able to pass the test until you have the catalytic converter replaced. 2. Check Engine LightAnother one of the earliest signs is when the Check Engine Light comes on. As the catalytic converter starts to fail, the oxygen sensors send a signal to the ECU, letting it know that there?s a problem.When you use your code scanner to read the Check Engine Light, you should see where the problem lies. Replacing the catalytic converter and any other failed parts will be required to get the Check Engine Light off once again. 3. Rotten Egg SmellIf you smell rotten eggs in your car, it could be that you just left some trash in the cabin. However, it?s more likely that there?s a problem with the catalytic converter.The rotten egg smell occurs because of hydrogen sulfide. When the catalytic converter is working as it should, this compound gets turned into sulfur dioxide, which doesn?t have any smell. However, when the compound comes out of the tailpipe without being properly converted, it leads to a terrible stench. 4. Poor AccelerationAs carbon builds up in the catalytic converter?s honeycomb design, it becomes impossible for it to continue converting gases as it should. This blockage creates poor performance because the engine needs a good amount of airflow to be optimized.The blockage leads to the wrong amount of backpressure, which can dramatically influence the overall airflow. The less airflow there is, the more the power is reduced. You will notice the lack of power the most when you attempt to accelerate. 5. Decreased Fuel EconomyWhen the catalytic converters backs up, it causes more than just poor performance. As the engine becomes starved of air, it can?t run efficiently. The harder the engine needs to work, the more fuel it will go through. You will see reduced fuel economy, which only further hurts your pocket every time you need to fill the tank. "
What is the Catalytic Converter?	"The catalytic converter is part of your car?s exhaust system. It looks similar to a muffler, but it is constructed with different materials. Inside the catalytic converter, there?s a unique honeycomb-like structure that contains catalyst particles that interact with the exhaust gases. These particles can include rhodium, palladium and platinum.The unburned hydrocarbons located in your car?s exhaust react with these materials in the catalytic converter. As the hydrocarbons are heated up, they break down into emissions that are less toxic and harmful to the environment. After the catalytic converter, these gases exit into the atmosphere through the tailpipe. "
Can the Catalytic Converter Be Removed?	"You might think that the most obvious solution is to simply take off the catalytic converter. Some people choose to do this and install a straight pipe, but is that the best solution? Yes, it makes for a cheaper repair, but there are reasons that it?s a terrible idea. First of all, your car is going to fail emissions testing; there?s no way around it. Additionally, the car is going to dramatically suffer, with performance and efficiency. On top of that, you are allowing more pollution to enter the environment, making you part of the problem.The only real solution is to replace the catalytic converter. If the car isn?t worth the expense, then it?s time to get rid of it and buy something else. Don?t take shortcuts when it comes to replacing the catalytic converter."
What Does Black Smoke from Exhaust Mean?	"When black smoke starts pouring out of the exhaust, it means that the engine is burning an excessive amount of fuel. The fuel can be mixed in abundance with oil inside the engine or it might be contaminated. This condition can occur in both gasoline and diesel engines. There are some cases when black smoke points to a minor problem that can be fixed quickly. However, black smoke can also indicate a serious condition, possibly even requiring an engine replacement. "
what are the Causes  Black Smoke from Exhaust ?	"1. Clogged Air FilterDirty Air FilterIf dust or contaminants block the air filter, there won?t be enough air hitting the cylinder. Because of this, more fuel is going to be burnt, leading to black smoke in the exhaust.Additionally, you will notice heavier smoke when the vehicle is put under pressure. If you are accelerating hard or towing heavy loads, there might be more black smoke coming from the tailpipe.RELATED: 6 Symptoms of a Dirty Air Filter2. Malfunctioning Fuel InjectorBad Fuel InjectorWhen the fuel injectors work as intended, the fuel gets atomized and spread equally into the cylinder. Malfunctioning injectors might not close properly or they can become clogged, both of which lead to problems.If more fuel is injected into the cylinders, it causes the engine to run rich. There won?t be enough air in the combustion chamber, which can lead to black smoke from the exhaust. 3. Failed EGR ValveEgr Valve EngineThe EGR valve is responsible for recirculating the exhaust gas to reduce the emissions of dangerous substances. It takes the exhaust gas and puts some of it back into the combustion chamber. When the EGR valve becomes damaged or faulty on a diesel engine, there aren?t enough gases being circulated. As a result, black smoke will start coming from the exhaust. 4. Bad MAF SensorMaf Sensor LocationThe Mass Airflow Sensors evaluate how much air is entering the engine. With this data, the injectors know how much fuel to combine for combustion.However, when the sensors fail, the wrong data can be sent. This causes the engine to think it needs more fuel than necessary, creating a rich-running environment. When the MAF sensor fails, you will also notice performance issues. 5. Bad Glow Plugs (Diesel)Glow Plug E1625147929280If you have a diesel engine, it?s possible the glow plugs have gone bad. You will notice other symptoms with this problem, such as trouble starting the vehicle.With a 12-volt test light, you can check the glow plugs. In some models, they are easy to replace, while others can prove to be more difficult. 6. Engine DepositsAs the engine ages, deposits start to form, leading to black smoke from the exhaust. The byproducts of combustion start to build up in the injectors and combustion chamber.Not only can these deposits interfere with engine performance, but they can eventually cause the motor to fail completely. To prevent these deposits, it?s important to use the right type of fuel and choose it from a top-tier station. "
How to Fix Black Smoke from Exhaust ?	"1. Clean Air SystemFor combustion to work as intended, the right amount of air must enter the engine. If there is a lack of air, fuel is only going to partially burn, leading to black smoke. The first step is to check the air filter and make sure it?s not clogged. This part should be replaced regularly, as part of the regular maintenance. Replacing the air filter should only cost you a few bucks and it is an easy task that doesn?t require any special tools. 2. Apply Fuel AdditivesDeposits and debris from the combustion process can build up in the cylinders and fuel injectors. As the deposits build up, fuel economy is reduced, performance is lowered and black smoke can be seen.However, there are additives available with detergents that will clean out the deposits. To use these, simply follow the directions on the bottle, generally instructing you to put the contents into the fuel tank after filling up. 3. Change SensorsIf the Mass Airflow Sensor is sending back the wrong information, there will be an excessive amount of fuel in the combustion chamber. You can find the sensor inside the air filter housing.In some cases, it?s possible to simply clean off the sensor and reinstall it. Other times, you will want to replace it to ensure proper readings. 4. Replace Glow Plugs (Diesel)If you drive a diesel vehicle and haven?t changed the glow plugs lately, now might be a good time. Just like spark plugs in a gas engine, the glow plugs should be changed as part of regular maintenance. You can find the service schedule in your owner?s manual for the proper interval.Replacing the glow plugs isn?t an expensive task. If you have some mechanical knowledge, you should have no trouble doing it yourself. "
Can I Drive a Car With Black Smoke Coming from the Exhaust?	"While it?s entirely possible to drive the car with black smoke out of the exhaust, you might not want to. When the engine runs rich, too much fuel is being mixed in the combustion chamber. This problem leads to many performance issues and could cause you to become stranded if the issues become too great.Even worse, the excessive amount of unburned fuel coming from the exhaust can cause damage to the catalytic converter over time. This is an expensive part to replace. Fixing the problem early can help you avoid this unnecessary bill. "
How to Clean a Throttle Body ?	"Cleaning a throttle body can save you a lot of money instead of replacing it. Here is a full guide of how you can clean your throttle body in 10 easy steps.Total Time: 20 minutesLocate Throttle BodyThrottle Body LocateThe first thing you need to do is to locate the throttle body. The throttle body is located on the intake manifold. You can often locate it by looking for a big intake hose going to the intake.Remove the Big Intake HoseThrottle Body CloseAfter you located the throttle body, loosen the clamp from the big hose and remove the hose so you can access and see the throttle body. It should look something similar to the picture.Remove throttle body (Optional)Remove Throttle BodyThis part is optional. Either you can remove the throttle body and do a proper cleaning, or you can let it sit and clean it installed on the intake manifold. It is your decision. Be very careful not to drop anything into the intake manifold if you decide not to remove it.Removing it is often pretty straightforward, remove the screws holding it and the electrical connector. Sometimes coolant and vacuum hoses are connected to it, which you have to remove.Open the throttle body flapOpen Throttle Body FlapOpen the flap either with a screwdriver or with your finger like the picture so you can access to clean it properly. If you decided not to remove the throttle body, this might be slightly more difficult than removing it.Spray Throttle body cleanerSpray Throttle BodyOpen your can of throttle body cleaner or some other cleaner, like brake cleaner, for example. Spray both sides of the throttle body flap and let it sit for 5 minutes, or what the instruction on your throttle body cleaner says.Clean the throttle bodyClean Throttle BodyAfter you waited for some time, take a cloth or paper and start to clean it. Make sure that you clean both the flap valve and the sides of the throttle body sides. The edges of the valve flap are the most important place to clean it.Install throttle body Again (Optional)Install Throttle BodyWhen you are satisfied with your cleaning results, it is time to install the throttle body again. Ensure that you install all hoses correctly and tighten the bolts after the torque specs in the repair manual. Refill coolant if it poured out a lot when you removed it.Install Intake Hose AgainInstall HoseInstall the intake hose again and tighten the clamp again. If you have a turbo engine, you need to make sure that both the hose and the throttle body are free from grease and dirt on the surface where the hose sits; otherwise, it might pop off because of the turbo pressure.Throttle body calibrationCar DiagnosticMost cars need a throttle body calibration after the cleaning is done. Some car models do this automatically when you cycle the ignition, so you can try recycling the ignition a couple of times to see if it gets calibrated. However, if your car runs really bad after the cleaning, you might need to get it calibrated with an OBD2 scanner.Clear trouble codes and test driveTest DriveOnce the throttle body is calibrated, you should clear the trouble codes if you have a diagnostic scanner. Take your car for a test drive and look for any signs of a problem or warning lights on your dashboard. If everything seems fine ? you have made a successful throttle body cleaning and saved some money!"
How Do I Clean The Throttle Body Without Removing it?	"If you want to clean the throttle body without removing it, the process is almost the same, but you have to be more careful. Open the throttle body valve with a screwdriver and gently spray the throttle body cleaner and remove dirt with a cloth. However, be very careful not to drop the cloth into the intake manifold.The trick to cleaning a throttle body without removing it is to not spray too much cleaner and be very careful not to drop anything into the intake. You may also want to let the vehicle sit for a couple of hours afterward to make sure the throttle body cleaner dries up.If you drop something in the intake manifold and can?t remove it, you need to remove the intake manifold and remove the thing before trying to start the engine."
Which Throttle Body Cleaner to use?	"There are many throttle cleaners on the market, so it is difficult to distinguish a bad one from a good one. The one I recommend is the CRC Throttle body cleaner, which you can find on Amazon.The brand name CRC is very popular among car enthusiasts. They produce first-class throttle body cleaners, so there is no doubt about the performance of their products.Most professional mechanics also use this cleaner and prefer it to others. The CRC throttle cleaner works quickly as soon as it is sprayed on and removes blockages from the pipes leading to the combustion chamber. When you use CRC throttle cleaner, your engine gets a new lease of life."
what are the Causes Idler Pulley Noise  ?	"The most common cause of idler pulley noise is a worn pulley or a slipping serpentine belt. It can also be caused by a damaged pulley, which creates a loud noise.Here?s a more detailed list of the reasons why you hear idler pulley noise coming from your engine:1. Worn Out PulleyIdler PulleyAs you drive your vehicle, the idler pulley spins with the drive belt. Over time, this leads to wear and tear of the pulley from repeated use.As it ages, the pulley can develop wear marks and scuffs on the surface. At first, this wear will only lead to minor noise, but it gradually gets worse and the pulley continues to endure stress. 2. Slipping BeltIf you ignore the signs of a worn-out pulley, the belt could eventually begin slipping. This condition occurs when the pulley becomes too worn. The pulley starts to bind and rub along the engine belt. This contact creates squealing noises that only get worse until you replace the pulley. Additionally, a slipping belt can cause other components in the engine to go bad, leading to more costly repairs if not fixed promptly.3. Damaged PulleyIf you continue to ignore the issues with the pulley, it is going to become severely damaged, causing it to break completely. The constant wear turns into cracks over time.It will break a little bit at first, but will create a chain reaction you don?t want to deal with. In fact, a damaged pulley can cause the serpentine belt to tear as well. When the serpentine belt breaks, you have bigger problems to deal with. The engine might stall or overheat as a result. Plus, the squealing noise is going to become consistently louder, creating an annoying ride. "
Idler Pulley Location ?	"The idler pulley and belt are located near the front of the engine. You will see the belt rotating in conjunction with the engine. You can find the idler pulley when you look at the serpentine belt moving on the engine.The majority of vehicles will be equipped with one idler pulley, although some have more depending on the configuration. Tension to the idler pulley is set by its position on the rail-type mount that tightens it in place. However, there are some idler pulleys that use spring tension instead."
what is The Function of an Idler Pulley ?	"Your car engine contains various drive belts or a serpentine belt that is responsible for running all of the accessories attached to it. Some of these accessories include the alternator, water pump, A/C compressor and power steering pump. However, these belts can easily interfere with other parts if they aren?t kept in their place.The idler tensioner pulley guides all of the drive belts. It is needed to route the belts around all of the accessories. With an idler pulley, the belts are aligned properly for a smooth rotation, ensuring that the function of your vehicle operates as it should.While the idler pulley tends to operate normally for a long time ? even the life of the vehicle ? it can wear out after many years of abuse. If the idler pulley becomes too damaged, it will lead to strange noises and cause other issues with the drive belts."
what is the Cost Idler Pulley Replacement ?	"The average idler pulley replacement cost is between $70 and $250, depending on the car model and labor cost. You can expect to pay $40 to $100 for the idler pulley and another $30 to $150 for the labor.However, these prices will depend on the type of vehicle you drive, how easy it is to install, and the local labor rates. Additionally, taxes and fees charged by the auto repair shop can vary.If you can replace the idler pulley yourself, it?s possible to save on the labor costs. Idler pulley replacement isn?t a difficult job and only requires basic tools.While the replacement of an idler pulley isn?t an expensive job, it?s one that some people try to put off. This is a bad idea since this low-cost replacement could end up being something more severe if ignored. The engine drive belts rely on the idler pulley. If you postpone replacement, you are looking at other problems down the road.You should always pay attention to the noises you hear coming from under the hood. You want to resolve the issues before the sounds get louder and worse. In fact, if you can get the idler pulley at the first sign of wear, you can avoid costly repairs later. "
What Are the Symptoms of Rear Main Seal Leak?	"The main symptoms of a rear main seal leak include:Leaking oilLow Oil levelsOil warning lightOil on underbodyHere is a more detailed list of the signs of a leaking rear main seal to look for:1. Leaking OilOil Leak On FloorA defective rear main seal is going to allow oil to seep through. However, the leak might get worse after the engine has been warmed up. For this reason, you might not always see the oil leak.It might be easiest to see after you park the vehicle by looking at the driveway or garage floor. If you see an oil stain on the driveway that wasn?t there before, you should be hunting down the source. 2. Low Oil LevelsEngine Oil LevelA failing rear main seal can allow a lot of oil to leak through in a short amount of time. For this reason, you might need to continually add oil to keep the levels up. It?s even possible that you need to add a quart or more each week. While it?s normal to add a small amount of oil from time to time, you shouldn?t need to top off constantly. Get the seal looked at before the problem becomes worse. 3. Oil Warning LightOil Level Warning LightSometimes, the first warning is the oil warning light. If this light comes on, it indicates that the oil pressure or level is low, and you should take it seriously.Pull over and shut the engine off. If there?s enough oil in the system to drive home, you may want to try, but use extreme caution. A rear main seal leak that is causing rapid oil loss can lead to engine failure and permanent damage.4. Oil on UnderbodyThe oil that is leaking from the rear main seal will start to pool on the bell housing of the engine and transmission. With blowback, the oil saturation might be on the underbody of the vehicle. With a quick inspection, you should be able to see the oil all over behind the back of the engine. Once this is spotted, you want to have the vehicle looked at immediately. "
what are the Causes of Rear Main Seal Leak ?	"1. Using the Wrong OilIf you put the wrong type of oil in the engine, it can lead to a leak. The chemical additives in today?s engine oils can affect the seals.It?s easy to deteriorate the seals if you use a particular oil that shouldn?t be used with your engine. Plus, the seal can dry out because of the oils and become stiff over time, making room for a leak. Check your owner?s manual and only use the oil that?s recommended. It can also be caused by too much oil in the engine.2. Wrong InstallationThe rear seal contains a coating of polytetrafluoroethylene. It?s meant to be put in place completely dry to create a proper seal. It?s also designed to prevent wear and seal better than silicone or Viton.If you put oil on the seal during installation, you are asking for trouble. It may cause leaks shortly after the installation. 3. Bad Main BearingWhen the main bearing goes out on the engine, the crankshaft starts to hang inside, causing stretching of the seal while the engine runs. The seal isn?t meant to be stretched and pulled on, so it?s bound to leak.However, you are going to have a fair warning that the main bearing has gone bad. There should be an immense amount of noise with this failure and there?s no reason to keep driving your car with this problem unresolved. 4. Worn Crankshaft The rear crankshaft seal is around the crankshaft itself. If the surface of the crankshaft is worn or defective in any way, it won?t be able to seal perfectly. The surfaces must be identical for a uniform fit. If the crankshaft surface doesn?t fit perfectly, it needs to be repaired.5. Clogged PVC SystemThe rear crankshaft seal rides on the shaft. If there is an excessive amount of pressure coming from the crankcase, it can cause the seal to leak.A clogged positive crankcase ventilation system can lead to this increased pressure. If left unchecked, it will push on the seal, leading to a leak. 6. MisalignmentIt doesn?t matter what type of transmission your car has, both automatic and manual cars can suffer from misalignment. Any misalignment of the flexplate or transmission?s input shaft can cause stress to the seal. A quick inspection of the flexplate on the automatic transmission can reveal this defect. If you are driving a manual transmission, you need to inspect the input shaft instead. "
what is the Function Rear Main Seal ?	"The rear main seal is used to prevent oil from seeping out of the back of the engine. It keeps the oil in place where the crankshaft is mounted to the car?s transmission through the flexplate or flywheel. That?s why the rear main seal is often referred to as the rear crankshaft seal.When the seal isn?t working correctly, the oil can escape from within the crankcase. This problem leads to a leak that can range in severity. "
Rear Main Seal Location ?	"The rear main seal is found at the back of the car engine. They are driven into the rear cover and can be concealed in the transmission?s bell-housing, making it more difficult to see. In most cases, it is not viewable without removing other critical components, even the transmission at times.While the seal is located at the back of the engine, it won?t always be towards the back of the vehicle. Some engines face a different way. Typically, the rear-wheel or four-wheel drive car has the front of the engine facing the front of the vehicle. But, some front-wheel and all-wheel drive vehicles will mount the engine transversely. The front of this engine is facing one side of the vehicle or the other, so the rear would be off to the other side.  The rear main seal is usually located opposite of where the belts and pulleys are located. These parts are typically at the front of the engine. "
Rear Main Seal Replacement Cost ?	"The cost to replace a rear main seal is usually between $800 and $1,500. However, the seal itself can cost as little as $50. The rest of the cost is because of the immense amount of labor associated with this job.In most cases, the transmission needs to be removed. For this reason alone, it?s not a job that is easily performed in the home garage. Here is how to replace it once the transmission is removed:"
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Crankshaft Position Sensor ?	"The most common symptom of a bad crankshaft position sensor is a check engine light on your dashboard. You will often also experience a stalling engine or bad engine performance. In rare cases, you will also notice engine vibrations or misfires.But while these are the most common symptoms, they aren?t the only signs that can point you toward a faulty crankshaft position sensor. We?ll take an in-depth look at the signs of a bad or failing crankshaft position sensor to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightAs I said before, the most common symptom of a bad crankshaft position sensor is a check engine light. The good news is that if you have a check engine light, then your ECM has reverted to default measurements.While this might cause a few performance issues, it should help prevent further damage from occurring. However, the longer you leave the problem unaddressed, the worse it will become.2. Excessive Engine VibrationsEngine BayIf your engine has a faulty crankshaft position sensor, then it isn?t optimizing any performance. Even worse, it might be utilizing incorrect readings to determine fuel and ignition timing. If the ECM doesn?t time things correctly, you?re in for a bumpy ride.Even worse, the problem is only going to get worse until you fix it, and it?s only a matter of time until further damage occurs.3. Reduced Engine PerformanceSlow Car AccelerationWhether you have a check engine light or not, a faulty crankshaft position sensor will lead to reduced engine performance. Whether it?s default values or the wrong values entirely, anything less than optimal timing is going to reduce your overall performance.Top speed and acceleration are the two most significant areas in which you are going to see a reduced performance.Keep in mind that an engine that isn?t performing correctly is also going to have a reduction in fuel economy, but unless you?re paying close attention to how many miles you get out of each tank, you might not notice.4. Difficulty Starting Your VehicleStarting CarIf your defective crankshaft position sensor is extremely out of sync, you might have trouble getting your vehicle started. Furthermore, you might have difficulty keeping it started.This is usually only a problem when the problem has persisted for some time, and you likely have multiple other underlying issues too. Moreover, it?s not usually a problem if you have a check engine light and the ECM has defaulted to predetermined values.Instead, it?s a problem when the crankshaft position sensor is feeding inaccurate readings and your ECM doesn?t realize it.5. Engine StallingEngine StallWhile this indicates a severe fault, it?s possible that a faulty crankshaft position sensor could lead your vehicle to stall. This happens when the ECM is sending all the wrong fuel and ignition timing to each cylinder.Typically, it will take a while for a problem to get this bad, and if it is, there?s a good chance there?s further damage that you?ll uncover after you replace the crankshaft position sensor.6. Engine MisfiresMisfiresWhile it?s unlikely that a vehicle with a check engine light on will misfire, if the ECM uses incorrect positions of the crankshaft, it becomes incredibly likely. Even worse, if you have an engine that?s misfiring, it?s only a matter of time before engine damage occurs.The longer you let a misfire happen, the worse it?ll get, and the more expensive the eventual repairs will be. If you have a misfire, get repairs as soon as possible."
Crankshaft Position Sensor Function ?	"The purpose of the crankshaft position sensor is to measure the position of the crankshaft. It might sound redundant, but it?s one of the most critical sensors in your vehicle. The crankshaft position sensor sends these measurements to the ECM, and the ECM uses them to optimize the rest of your vehicle?s timing.If the crankshaft position sensor fails, then the ECM reverts to default values. While these values keep the engine running, you?ll likely notice various performance issues.However, if the ECM doesn?t realize that the crankshaft position sensor has failed and is sending it errant measurements, the computer will optimize performance to inaccurate readings. This can quickly lead to more damage and expensive repairs."
Crankshaft Position Sensor Location ?	"Your vehicle?s crankshaft position sensor is located near the bottom of the engine by the crankshaft. That makes sense because it?s the crankshaft position sensor?s job to measure the crankshaft location.When you?re trying to track down the crankshaft position sensor, look towards the engine?s bottom, generally on one of the sides. Since the sensor is so far down in the engine, it can be hard to locate and even harder to remove and replace if you have a faulty one. "
Crankshaft Position Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"The average crankshaft sensor replacement cost is between $150 and $250. However, it?s not uncommon for those prices to skyrocket if you have a higher-end vehicle.That?s because the labor costs are typically between $90 and $110. From there, the rest of the cost comes down to parts. While most crankshaft position sensors cost under $100, there are a few out there that can blow through that price point.Fortunately for most drivers, those more expensive parts are typically only on high-end luxury vehicles. If you?re looking to save a few bucks, you can replace the sensor yourself. It?s a pretty straightforward job if you can reach the sensor.While this is only going to save you about $100, if you?re a little mechanically inclined, you can complete the entire job in under 30 minutes.It is rare, but there are actually some car models where the sensor is located behind the flywheel, and if this is the case, you will have to remove the gearbox to replace the sensor.Don?t forget to diagnose and test the crankshaft position sensor before replacing it."
Can I run a car without a crankshaft position sensor?	"Your car engine will most likely not run without a crankshaft position sensor. If your car?s crankshaft position sensor goes bad, the engine may not start because it won?t be able to tell when the spark plugs should fire. However, if your car uses camshaft position sensors, it is possible that the ECM will use these instead of the crankshaft position sensor. So in this case, your car could potentially run without the crankshaft position sensor. "
Will disconnecting the battery reset the crankshaft sensor?	"No. The crankshaft sensor is located on the engine block and measures the position of the crankshaft. It can?t be reset by disconnecting the battery because there is no data stored to be reset. In most car models, you need to use an OBD2 scanner to clear the ECM?s trouble codes."
How long do crankshaft sensors last?	"There is no definitive answer to this question as the lifespan of a crankshaft sensor depends on a number of factors such as driving habits, sensor manufacturer, and the overall condition of the vehicle. Crankshaft sensors are built to last the life of the car, and should only be replaced if they are bad."
Can a crankshaft sensor be cleaned?	"Yes. A crankshaft sensor can be cleaned. Just be careful not to damage the sensor when cleaning it. However, just cleaning the sensor probably won?t do much to fix it, but if the sensor?s connector pins are corroded, it might help to fix the sensor."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Throttle Body ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad or failing throttle body include rough idle, rough acceleration, a check engine light, engine misfires, or a stalling engine. You may also notice that your fuel consumption has changed or your car?s idle fluctuates.If you are still interested in more in-depth knowledge about each symptom, here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing throttle body to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightThe throttle body has some angle sensors and other sensors installed inside of it. As soon as the car?s onboard computer detects a problem with the throttle body signal, it will cause the check engine light to illuminate.The check engine light also comes on due to several other reasons, which is why we recommend visiting an auto specialist and having the car scanned for any trouble codes when it pops up on your dashboard.2. Rough IdlingCar Engine Rough IdleIf you notice your car?s engine idle is jumping up and down and making strange sounds, it may be due to a dirty or damaged throttle body.The car engine is most sensitive at idle, where you will notice symptoms of a dirty or bad throttle body first.3. Rough AccelerationSlow AccelerationThe throttle body also regulates the air/fuel mixture that enters the engine. This means that a faulty throttle body can mess the air/fuel mixture up, which will cause problems when accelerating.If you notice that your car has a very uneven acceleration ? sometimes it is fast and sometimes slow ? you might have a bad throttle body.4. MisfiresCar MisfiresMisfires occur either when the air/fuel mixture is very wrong, or when the spark plug produces a weak spark. Misfires represent incomplete combustion inside the combustion chamber.As we told you before, a bad throttle body can mess with the air/fuel mixture, and it can also cause your engine to misfire. Misfires are easily recognized as small bumps when you are revving the engine.5. High RPM IdleHigh Idle RpmThe throttle body controls the engine?s idle to make sure it is always holding a steady RPM. If there is a problem with the throttle body, it may cause the RPM to be way too high.A throttle body that isn?t calibrated can also cause this. You can calibrate the throttle body with most diagnostic scanners.6. Stalling IdleLow Idle RpmThe throttle body can affect the RPM the other way also. It can cause the RPM to be so low at idle that the engine will die. This is often caused when there is a lot of soot and dirt on the throttle body flap, causing less air to enter the engine and, therefore, a low idle RPM.Usually, a throttle body cleaning and a throttle body calibration with a diagnostic tool will solve this problem.7. Poor Engine PerformanceSlow CarThe engine requires both adequate air and fuel supply to perform effectively. If the engine is not receiving proper air supply due to a damaged throttle body, the engine will suffer, and as a result, the driver will experience a drop in performance.If your car feels like it lost half of its power when accelerating, it can absolutely be caused by a bad throttle body.8. Changed Fuel ConsumptionBad Fuel ConsumptionYou already know that a bad throttle body will cause a strange fuel mixture. This can also show up on fuel consumption if you notice that you have to refuel more frequently or rarely; a bad throttle body could cause it.Refueling less frequently might sound like a good thing, but your engine doesn?t think the same in the long run!"
What Is a Throttle Body?	"The throttle body of your vehicle is basically a butterfly valve. The throttle body?s core function is to regulate and control the amount of air allowed to enter the engine.The input data is sensed from the driver?s pressure on the accelerator pedal of the vehicle.Consequently, more fuel is allowed to enter the internal combustion engine to ensure greater combustion and more acceleration power when more air enters the system.There is only one throttle body in most vehicles, with a rare exception of special, larger vehicles. The function of the throttle body is also dependent on other parts, such as the air filter."
how to clean the Throttle Body ?	"Even if you have an air filter on your car, dirt and soot come from the turbocharger, EGR valve, and the crankcase ventilation and get stuck on the throttle body valve. After a while, they will cover the valve so much that the RPM will be affected.A dirty throttle body valve causes many problems with the throttle body; therefore, it is often possible to resolve any issues simply by cleaning it. To find out more about cleaning a dirty throttle body, you can check our guide here: Throttle body cleaning. Do not forget to recalibrate the throttle body with a diagnostic scanner afterward, though."
where the Throttle Body Location ?	"The throttle body is often located on the intake manifold at the big hose from the turbocharger or air filter.Usually, aluminum is used for the manufacture of the throttle body. The location of the throttle body can be a little different for different vehicles.However, according to the throttle body?s purpose, it should be located anywhere between the air filter and the intake manifold."
what is the Throttle Body Replacement Cost ?	"The average throttle body replacement cost is between $250 and $650, depending on the car model and labor costs. The throttle body costs between $200 and $500, while the labor cost is around $50 and $150.The throttle body can be differently priced depending on different vehicles, models, and the manufacturing company. Basically, the main cost involved in replacing a throttle body is the cost of the parts required to be replaced.Regular maintenance can effectively prolong the life of the throttle body?s parts, and you may not require a replacement for a long time.The labor cost involved in the replacement can be economical or expensive, depending on which car shop services you for the replacement.Remember that you need to make a recalibration of the throttle body valve after a replacement with a diagnostic scanner.You also want to look for technical service bulletins regarding the throttle body for your car model. Many GM vehicles have bulletins for the throttle body."
Can I replace the throttle body myself?	"Replacing the throttle body is often quite straightforward in most car models with some basic knowledge. For some car models, however, it is required to reset/calibrate the throttle body with a diagnostic scanner after the replacement, which most people don?t have at home."
Does cleaning the throttle body make a difference?	"Cleaning the throttle body can make a difference, but it depends on how dirty it is. Throttle bodies can get dirty over time from oil residue, carbon buildup, and other gunk that can accumulate.When they?re clean, they work more efficiently and can help improve fuel economy and performance. So if your throttle body is dirty, cleaning it could make a noticeable difference in your car?s driving characteristics."
Can I drive with throttle body problems?	"It depends on the severity of the throttle body problems. If the throttle body is not working properly, then the car will not be able to accelerate or move. In most cases, if there is a problem with the throttle body, the car will not start at all."
How do I reset a throttle body?	"There are a few different ways to reset a throttle body, depending on the make and model of your vehicle. Some may require the battery to be disconnected for a period of time in order for the system to reset, and for others, you will need a diagnostic tool to relearn the settings. Check a repair manual for your specific car model."
Conclusion	"If you experience any of these symptoms, it?s important to take your car to a mechanic as soon as possible to have it diagnosed and repaired so you can get back on the road safely. Issues with the throttle body can result in further damage to the engine or even accidents.If you feel you have the knowledge to diagnose the issue yourself, the best way to start is to read the fault codes from the ECM with a diagnostic tool. You can also try cleaning the throttle body."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Rocker Arm ?	"The most common symptom of a bad rocker arm is clicking or ticking noises coming from the cylinder head of the engine. It can also cause misfires or a stalling engine together with a check engine light on your dashboard.If you suspect that your car has a damaged rocker arm, the chances are that your vehicle is showing some of these signs. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing rocker arm to look for:1. Clicking or Ticking NoisesEngine Ticking NoiseIf you hear a clicking or ticking noise when you start your engine, a worn rocker arm might be the problem. There are also various other reasons that a clicking or ticking noise might be occurring. Once you?ve ruled out any external causes, you can start worrying about internal issues like a broken rocker arm.If you hear a clicking or ticking noise and suspect a broken rocker arm, listen to see if the noise is coming from the top of the engine. If it?s a V-shaped engine, the noise will only be coming from one side.Once you?ve identified the location of the ticking or clicking noise, the only way to verify that it?s a broken rocker arm is to tear apart the top end of the engine and look at what?s going on.2. Misfires or StallingSlow Car AccelerationThe rocker arm controls the amount of time each intake and exhaust valve is open, so it makes sense that if one of them isn?t functioning correctly, you?ll notice some performance issues. While weaker than normal engine performance is typical, a stalling engine is not.While it?s certainly possible, most engines can run if one cylinder is misfiring or not functioning correctly. You?ll notice the drop in performance, but if an engine is stalling because of a single worn or broken rocker arm, chances are there?s another problem you?ll need to address too.3. Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light On Dashboard E1609869927250There are tons of sensors monitoring your engine?s performance. Everything gets checked and verified for proper function. So, while there?s no sensor for each rocker arm, the decreased engine performance can easily lead to a check engine light.The exact code on that light will vary because the broken or worn rocker arm?s side effect tripped it, not the rocker arm itself. That?s not to say that the code won?t mention a rocker arm ? it definitely can ? but it might point you towards an actuator or a switch when that?s not necessarily the problem ? but it could be!4. Physical DeteriorationBroken Engine Rocker ArmOnce you suspect a broken or worn rocker arm, the only way to 100 percent verify that the rocker arm is the issue is to remove the valve covers and see what?s going on underneath. If your vehicle has worn rocker arms, you?ll notice excessive play or metal underneath the rocker arm. If the rocker arm is extremely damaged, you might even find a cracked rocker arm.If you?re not sure, compare the rocker arms against each other ? they should all look the same. If any rocker arm shows signs of wear or damage, you should replace them all."
what is the The Function of a Rocker Arm ?	"While most people don?t think of rocker arms, they?re a critical and central part of your engine. The rocker arms lift your exhaust and intake valves to allow air to enter and exit the combustion chamber at the appropriate time.In purely mechanical turns, the rocker arms transfer the vertical reciprocal motion from the pushrods to the exhaust/intake valves.It might not sound like much, but without these little contraptions in your engine, you wouldn?t start, and you wouldn?t get any air into or out of the combustion chamber.Some engines do not have rocker arms. Instead, the camshaft pushes directly on the hydraulic lifter, which is then pushed directly on the valve."
where the Rocker Arm Location ?	"The rocker arms are located at the engine head, connecting the camshaft to the exhaust and intake valves.When you look at your engine, you?re not going to see the rocker arms. That?s because they?re underneath the valve covers that are positioned directly over the engine?s heads. Furthermore, they?re located directly between the engine?s pushrods and the intake and exhaust valves.While it?s easy to point to where a rocker arm is, actually seeing and accessing the rocker arms is far more complicated."
what is the Rocker Arm Replacement Cost ?	"The average single rocker arm replacement cost ranges from $500 to $1,500, and almost all of this cost is for labor. In fact, each rocker arm typically costs between $5 and $20. But that?s not the only parts you?ll need.Because to reach the rocker arms, you?ll need to remove the valve covers and various other components, so you should replace all the gaskets associated with them too. You?ll also end up draining the oil, so you should throw a filter in there as well.But even with all of those factors thrown in, the parts should still only cost you around $100 to $150 ? all the rest is the cost of labor. That?s a large part of the reason you should replace all of your rocker arms at the same time.They tend to wear out at a similar rate, and since most of the work the mechanic already did most of the work by accessing the rocker arms, throwing in a few extra rocker arms doesn?t cost you another $500 to $1,500 each. As long as they?re under the same valve cover, you?re probably only looking at an extra $10 to $25 for each additional rocker arm.If you have to remove the other valve cover gasket to reach the additional rocker arms (like in a V-shaped engine), this cost will be slightly higher, but it?s still worth the initial investment to save you some money down the road.But just because most of the cost is in labor doesn?t mean you should attempt to complete this repair yourself. That?s because it?s a labor-intensive process that requires a lot of technical know-how. Doing the job the wrong way can be more detrimental than not doing it all.Luckily, rocker arms do not get damaged or worn so often that they need a replacement. The hydraulic lifters control this wear. Most rocker arms also have adjustments if they become worn, but you do definitely have to replace it if one is getting damaged."
What Are The Differences Between A Long block and a Short block?	"The biggest difference between a short block and a long block engine is the number of parts included in the purchase. A long block contains a cylinder head with most of the internal parts, while the short block is only the lower part of the motor.However, there are actually not the number of parts included in the purchase that?s the difference. Let?s take a closer look at the differences."
Key Differences Between Long And Short Blocks ?	"To dive deeper into the long and short block differences, we will break down the most important points.1. Parts IncludedThe key difference between the short block vs. long block is the number of parts included when purchasing the engine.The short block engine includes the block itself, along with pistons, rods and crank. All of these are fully assembled, plus there might be some other components installed, such as the timing chain, covers and camshaft. The long block engine is the same as a short block, but the valvetrain and heads are usually installed. With a deluxe long block, you will also get the carburetor or throttle body, oil pan, intake manifold and coil packs or a distributor. These aren?t to be confused with a bare block engine, which is just the aluminum or cast iron block that requires machine work before you turn it into your car engine. Additionally, the rotating assemblies come with the pistons, rods and crank that are balanced with the required bearings. 2. Cost In general, the short block engine is going to be cheaper upfront. Typically, you can expect to spend between $1,200 and $5,000 for most short block engines. Of course, this price depends on what year, make and model your vehicle is. The savings of a short block engine is quickly erased once you start adding the needed parts. These will come standard on the long block engine, giving you a complete package. In the end, you might spend less overall for a long block engine.3. Installation TimeThe long block engine has everything you need already fitted and ready to work. If you have to add a few parts, it won?t be many. Because of this design, it?s much easier to install a long block engine.However, the short block engine allows for more customization. You will need to fit all of the additional parts you buy, which does turn into a longer installation time. If you don?t perform the installation yourself, you are also looking at higher bills from your local engine shop. 4. WarrantyThe warranty on the long block will usually be longer than the short block engine. It?s also more extensive, covering a variety of parts that are included with your bundled purchase.When you add parts to your short block engine, these components aren?t going to be covered by the block warranty. If there?s a faulty fitting, you will be covering the damage yourself. If you plan to have a mechanic perform the work for you, make sure they offer some type of guarantee. "
What is a Short Block Engine?	"The short block engine is considered the smaller package when it comes to automotive motors. It will include the cylinder block and some vital parts such as the connecting rods, cam, pistons and crankshaft. However, there could be some variation to what?s included based on the manufacturer. With every short block engine, there will be additional components needed, such as the oil pump, cylinder heads and gaskets. You will have to purchase these separately. "
what are the Pros and Cons of a Short Block ?	"If you want to purchase a short block engine, consider these advantages and disadvantages first.ProsUpfront lower costsAllows for more customizationProvides a superior learning experienceConsRequires more assemblyIncreased installation timeOther parts are needed, which increases the priceParts need to be tunedMore complicatedBlock is only the part with a warranty"
What is a Long Block Engine?	"The long block engine is a more complete variation of the short block. It?s going to include the same components as the short block, but it also adds the camshaft, cylinder head, valvetrain, valve covers and oil pan. Still, it isn?t a complete package. The long block engine will still need a few components added, such as the intake and exhaust manifolds, fuel system and several electrical parts. If you are replacing every part of the engine assembly, you might prefer a turn-key engine instead. "
what are the Pros and Cons of a Long Block ?	It?s important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of the long block engine as well. ProsParts that are included have been tunedEntire package includes a warrantyConsidered plug-and-play with the addition of a few more partsConsUpfront costs are higherDoesn?t allow for a lot of customizationDoesn?t include everything a turn-key engine does
how to choose between  Short Block and Long Block Engines ?	"Which one should you buy, a short block or long block engine? If you are looking for reliable performance and a quicker installation, you might prefer the long block. Many of the parts come preinstalled, ensuring less can go wrong. You might also spend less with this option, especially if you are having it installed by a mechanic.However, not all long blocks work well with particular makes and models. If you want to replicate the performance of your vehicle from the factory, you need to make sure you purchase a comparable long block that works with the ECU and transmission of your car. On the flip side, the short block engine allows for more customization, permitting you to fit a variety of external components based on your needs. If you want to upgrade some engine parts, the short block allows you to do that. For example, if you wanted to add a performance cylinder head, you could do that easily with a short block engine, whereas the long block comes with a preinstalled cylinder head. With a few upgrades, you could experience more power than with the stock engine. We recommend opting for a short block engine if you are hoping to tune the motor for more performance. However, most consumers will find that the long block engine has everything needed for a quick replacement and is often more cost-effective."
what is the top Car Sensors ?	"1. Engine Oil Level SensorOil Level SensorOne of the most common sensors in your vehicle is the engine oil level sensor. This sensor measures the oil level in your engine oil pan to ensure that it?s at a safe operating capacity. If you don?t have enough oil, this sensor will cause an oil level warning light on your dashboard.This sensor is often installed on the bottom of the oil pan, so you need to tap out the engine oil to replace it. This depends on the engine model, though.2. Engine Oil Pressure SensorOil Pressure SensorThe engine oil pressure sensor is often quite similar to the oil level sensor, except that it measures the oil pressure after the oil pump. You will often find this sensor located at the engine block, often near the fuel filter.The engine oil pressure sensor often has some plastic parts that can crack with age, which can cause it to start leaking before it malfunctions. You will mostly notice a bad oil pressure sensor by seeing a red oil pressure light on your dashboard.3. Coolant Temperature SensorsCoolant Temperature SensorAnother critical sensor in your engine is the coolant temperature sensor. This sensor monitors your coolant temperature, which is a great way to determine your engine?s overall temperature. If it gets too hot, engine damage can occur.In some newer car models, the coolant temperature should shut off your engine once it reaches a high enough temperature.4. Mass Airflow SensorIntake And Maf SensorYour vehicle?s engine needs to know how much air is coming in so it can optimize the fuel ratio for maximum performance. Your mass airflow sensor (MAF) measures the amount of air coming through the intake, so it knows how much it?s bringing in.The MAF sensor is often located on the intake hose between your intake manifold and the air filter box.5. Intake Air Temperature SensorIntake Air Temperature SensorBelieve it or not, the air temperature coming into the engine is a critical part of maximizing engine performance. That?s why the intake air temperature sensor (IAT) tells the ECM the air temperature, so it makes adjustments and maximizes performance.The IAT sensor can either be separated or integrated into the MAF Sensor. Being integrated into the MAF sensor is far more common on newer car models.6. Oxygen SensorsBad O2 Sensor E1609866265874Oxygen sensors, also known as O2 sensors, measure your air-fuel mixture from the exhaust and the catalytic converter?s effectiveness (CAT). One oxygen sensor measures the air?s makeup before the CAT, and one measures the makeup of the air after the CAT.If there?s not enough of a drop in emissions, it lets the ECM know that you need to make repairs by showing a check engine light on your dashboard.RELATED: 5 Symptoms of a Bad Oxygen Sensor (O2)7. Knock SensorsEngine Knock SensorKnock sensors are there to make sure that your engine will not suffer from detonation or so-called knocking. Detonation or knock in a car engine is fatal for the internal parts, resulting in a very costly repair.This could also be from misfires or broken components, but if your engine?s knock sensor hears something, you have a problem.8. Crankshaft/Camshaft Position SensorsCrankshaft Position SensorsEngine timing relies on a perfect symphony between the crankshaft and camshaft ? and their respective position sensors let the ECM know precisely where each one is at. If those positions don?t line up to what they should be, you need to know as soon as possible.You do often have one sensor on the camshaft and one on the crankshaft. Some car models only have a crankshaft position sensor, though.RELATED: 6 Symptoms of a Bad Crankshaft Position Sensor9. Throttle Position SensorThrottle Body With Position Sensor E1609870227678Nowadays, the connection between the accelerator pedal and the throttle body is achieved via electronics instead of with a cable. Therefore, on the throttle body, there is a throttle position sensor to measure the throttle flap?s angle.The throttle position sensor tells the ECM exactly how open the throttle is. That way, if there?s a problem between the pedal and the throttle, it won?t dump a ton of fuel in and damage the engine because of a sticky throttle.10. Manifold Absolute Pressure SensorMap Sensor LocationYour manifold absolute pressure sensor (MAP) sensor does exactly what it sounds like it would do ? it measures pressure in the manifold. This takes your mass airflow sensor one step further by measuring how much air is actually making it to your engine. This is a critical component in fuel-injected engines, as it optimizes your fuel ratios for the best possible performance.It also takes the job from the boost pressure sensor and measures the turbo pressure, if your car is equipped with one.RELATED: 10 Symptoms of a Bad MAP Sensor11. Fuel Pressure SensorFuel Pressure Sensor E1609977575722The fuel pressure sensor measures the fuel pressure on your fuel pressure line or at the fuel pressure rail. It is most likely to be mounted on your fuel pressure rail, but sometimes, it can also be mounted on the fuel pressure line. It is critical for the engine control module to measure the fuel pressure. An increase in pressure would result in a richer fuel mixture, and a lower pressure would result in a leaner fuel mixture.The sensor itself is often quite cheap, but it can be unwieldy to replace it if you are not an experienced mechanic. (A lot of fuel may leak out).12. Coolant Level SensorLow Coolant LevelIf your vehicle doesn?t have enough coolant, it?s going to overheat. That?s why most vehicles come with a coolant level sensor. That way, you can avoid problems before you hit the road. If your vehicle doesn?t have enough coolant, then the coolant level sensor will light up the check engine light. Sometimes, it will keep you from starting your vehicle.The coolant level sensor is located on your coolant reservoir.13. Nox SensorNox SensorThe Nox sensor measures the Nox volume in the exhaust gases. This sensor is not installed in many car models. Typically you can find them at Volkswagen, Audi, Seat, and Skoda. The Nox sensor is installed on the exhaust pipe and the control unit under a plastic cover.Unfortunately, replacing the NOX sensor usually requires replacing the control unit for the sensor as well. The control unit and the sensor are often costly, and the replacement can be a bit tricky because the sensor tends to rust and get stuck.14. Exhaust temperature sensorExhaust Temperature SensorThe exhaust temperature sensor is often installed in diesel engines. Its purpose is to measure the exhaust gas temperature before and after the particle filter to optimize particle filter regeneration. Depending on the vehicle engine model, you often have 1 to 4 exhaust gas temperature sensors.The sensors are installed on the exhaust pipe and the exhaust manifold, and sometimes also on the turbocharger. The sensors are often quite expensive, and can be difficult to reach and replace; they often rust and get stuck.15. Boost pressure sensorBoost Pressure SensorThe boost pressure sensor measures the boost pressure in the intake boost pipes. You will only have this sensor if your car is equipped with a turbo or supercharger.The boost pressure sensors are often cheap and can be easily replaced on most car models. They can be difficult to access in some car models if they are mounted on the intake manifold."
How many sensors are in a car engine?	There are around 15-30 sensors in a modern car engine if you don?t include the solenoids. You can find over 70 sensors in a modern car if you count every sensor in the whole car.
Conclusion	"While this list isn?t nearly all-exhaustive of all the different sensors you can find in a vehicle, these are some of the most common, and the most likely ones that you?ll run into problems with.But just remember that while these sensors might give you a few headaches from time to time, they?re preventing even more significant problems from cropping up and destroying your engine! Here is a video of most car sensors."
wwhat are the Symptoms Of A Clogged Or Bad Fuel Injector ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad fuel injector are a misfiring cylinder and a check engine warning light on your dashboard. You may also notice a vibrating engine or bad fuel odor at idle. If your engine stalls on idle, that could also be a sign.Since the fuel injector is directly connected to the engine, any problem with the fuel injector will result in a malfunction of the vehicle?s performance.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or clogged fuel injector to be on the lookout for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightOne of the most obvious symptoms is that the check engine light on your dashboard is blinking. If one of the fuel injectors is clogged or dirty and is not efficiently supplying fuel to the engine, an electrical signal is sent to warn the driver.Please note that the check engine light can also be activated for various other reasons. It is therefore recommended that you take your car to a garage and have it scanned for error codes.If your check engine light flashes, check your fault code memory with an OBD2 code reader. They do not cost that much and you can read the fault code memory at home.2. Engine VibratesEngine Jump Idle E1609791573302If the engine is not receiving enough fuel, it will start to vibrate as soon as it has completed a full cycle. On turbocharged engines, a clogged or dirty fuel injector can have dangerous effects and lead to a detonation that can damage the engine.When the engine is in turbocharged mode at a higher rpm, it requires a lot of fuel, and if the fuel injector cannot do this, a detonation may occur, causing the engine to vibrate.3. Misfiring EngineCar Misfires E1609774947173The engine will misfire if the fuel injector is dirty, clogged, or does not open properly. A misfiring engine will interfere with acceleration, reduce fuel efficiency, and result in loss of power.This requires immediate attention, as your engine could also start knocking and cause serious damage to your engine.4. Bad Fuel OdorBad Fuel Odor Smell E1609793024317This symptom occurs when the fuel injector is leaking or when the fuel injector does not close properly. Excess fuel creates a bad smell, which is noticeable while driving.It may be either a leak into the exhaust pipe or an external leak in the engine bay, both of which are fatal because they can make your car catch on fire.5. Increased Fuel ConsumptionBad Fuel EconomyIf you regularly monitor your fuel consumption, you will notice a decrease or increase in fuel efficiency due to a poor injector. A faulty injector delivers either too much or too little fuel to the engine than required and reduces the vehicle?s fuel consumption.If you suspect that your fuel consumption has changed, it may be due to a bad fuel injector.6. Rough Engine Idling / StallingCar Engine Rough Idle E1609793094987If you experience rough idle or the engine stalls on low RPM, it may be due to a bad fuel injector. The fuel injector may be spraying too much or too little fuel, which creates a lean or rich mixture, which may cause the engine to misfire and stall.7. Failed Emission TestCar Emission Test E1609793156790If the fuel injector?s spray pattern has changed, and it is injecting too little or too much fuel into the engine, your car will most likely not pass the emission test. This is because too much fuel or too little will be enough to increase the emissions, and the catalytic converter will not be able to do its job properly.8. Fuel LeakCar Fuel Leak E1609793222449If you see a fuel leak in the engine bay, it may be because of a bad fuel injector. Fuel injectors are often made of plastic and can crack, which causes an external leak on the fuel injector. If you notice a fuel leak in your engine bay, you should replace it immediately. Otherwise, it may cause an engine fire."
Understanding the Fuel Injection System ?	"Your car engine uses an internal combustion process to run and uses two key elements: oxygen and fuel. The oxygen is extracted from the engine?s air, while the fuel is taken from the fuel reservoir. The air intake takes over the task of supplying air to the engine. Since the oxygen supply varies, the fuel injection system?s task is to constantly vary the amount of gasoline to be supplied according to the oxygen supply.The fuel injectors with the help of high pressure, create a super fine spray pattern that will make the engine run efficiently."
how to clean Fuel Injector ?	"In some cases, your fuel injector is actually just clogged with dirt. This can be caused by a bad fuel filter, which lets dirt pass to the fuel injector. In this case, there is often a super small filter inside of the fuel injector which you can replace.Another case is that the fuel injector needs some lubrication because it has been standing unused for a while, especially if you have been driving on ethanol.Remember, if you want to try an injector cleaning, the best way is to do it to all injectors at once to avoid the different amounts of fuel spray after the cleaning.Some special workshops can do fuel injector cleaning for you. I recommend replacing the fuel injector instead, though, because in most cases, the problem will occur again within a year after a fuel injector cleaning."
where the Fuel Injector Location  ?	"The fuel injectors are located on the engine?s intake side, under the fuel rail, which is often located on the intake manifold.If you have a diesel car, your fuel injector is likely located in the cylinder head, but gas fuel injectors are installed on the intake manifold in almost all cases.There are some rare cases when your car has direct injection and the injectors are installed in the cylinder head."
what the Fuel Injector Replacement Cost ?	"The average fuel injector replacement cost is between $100 and $500, depending on the car model and labor costs. A fuel injector usually costs between $50 and $300. Labor usually costs between $50 and 200$.The fuel injector?s cost may differ a lot depending on if you have a gas or diesel engine. Diesel injectors are often very expensive, which can result in part costs of $400 or more.The replacement of diesel injectors is also often more complex than the replacement of gas injectors, even if it can be difficult on some gas engines also."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Oil Pressure Sensor ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad or failing oil pressure sensor are an oil pressure light on your dashboard, a noisy engine, or engine performance issues. You may also notice that the oil pressure sensor is leaking oil.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing oil pressure sensor to look for:1. Oil pressure light on dashboard Engine Oil Pressure LightOne of the most common symptoms of a faulty oil pressure sensor is your oil pressure light illuminating on your dash cluster. This light is illuminated when your oil pressure sensor detects low oil pressure or high oil pressure and then sends a signal to your ECU, which then passes a signal to your dash cluster, switching on your oil warning light. This is how this system should work in theory. However, if your sensor is faulty, then it will switch the oil light on, even if the oil pressure is okay.The easiest way to determine this fault is to manually check your oil pressure with an oil pressure gauge. If your oil pressure is normal, this indicates a faulty sensor. Another method of diagnosing this fault is to use a fault code reader and see if there are any stored faults in your vehicle?s ECU pertaining to your oil pressure sensor. 2. Noisy Timing Chain and EngineTiming ChainIf your engine has a timing chain that is oil fed, then having the correct oil pressure is even more important. This is because your chain uses the oil pumped from your oil pump to keep itself lubricated and moving freely. The tensioners that hold the chain?s tension in place are also often oil fed, which again is another reason why maintaining oil pressure is vital. If your engine oil pressure drops, this can cause your chain tensioners to slacken off, which leaves you with a loose chain that whips and gets thrown around against the various pulleys and housings. This is usually audible as you stand next to the vehicle while the engine is sat at idle. It will sound like a deep, metallic rattling noise coming from your engine block. If you can hear this from your engine, but your oil light hasn?t come on, this can be a sign of a faulty oil pressure sensor. If your chain has lost its tension due to a lack of oil pressure, and your oil light hasn?t illuminated on your dash cluster, you should replace the oil pressure sensor after carrying out the necessary repairs on your engine to rectify the fault with the chain.You may also experience other noisy engine parts if your oil pressure is low.3. Oil Leak From Oil Pressure Sensor Engine Oil LeakYour oil pressure sensor is designed to be sat in the oil system of your car so that it can detect the oil pressure. However, this can sometimes lead to your oil pressure leaking oil, either from the threads or through the center of the actual sensor itself. Vauxhalls are known for having this as a common problem on some of their models. The oil pressure sensor leaks oil through the center of its body, filling the block connector and spraying the engine bay with oil. You can easily diagnose this fault by checking for any oil leaks from around the pressure sensor. Remove the sensor?s block connector to check inside for oil. If you find any oil in either of these locations, then you?ll need to replace your sensor. You can also visually inspect the sensor whilst the engine is idling and make sure there?s no sign of any oil leaking from the sensor body."
What is an Oil Pressure Sensor?	"Most modern cars have an oil pressure sensor fitted somewhere on the engine block. This sensor allows the vehicle?s ECU to determine the ? yep, you guessed it ? running pressure of the oil within the engine. This allows the engine to passively monitor whether the oil system loses pressure. If for whatever reason, your engine does lose its oil pressure, this can result in major damage to the rest of your engine, which is the main reason that it is constantly monitored. The pressure is created by your vehicle?s oil pump, which simply lifts the engine oil from your sump to the head of your engine to both cool and lubricate the various engine components. If the oil pressure drops, then your engine is no longer able to stay lubricated or cooled effectively, and this can result in components seizing, causing irreversible damage and a heavy repair bill. This is the main reason why your oil pressure is constantly monitored. So, as soon as your oil pressure light comes on, switch off the engine and don?t restart until it?s been repaired. By doing this, you?ll prevent further damage from taking place. "
where the Oil Pressure Sensor Location ?	"The exact location of your oil pressure sensor can vary depending on your make, model and engine.The oil pressure sensor is often located in the engine block near the bottom of the cylinder head. But it can also be installed on the cylinder head. It will have a block connector attached to it, and have 1 or 2 thin wires attached. "
Oil Pressure Sensor Replacement Cost  ?	"The average oil pressure sensor replacement cost is between $50 and $250, depending on the car model and labor costs. An oil pressure sensor costs $30 to $100, and the labor costs $20 to $150.The cost for an oil pressure sensor will depend entirely on your vehicle?s specific product number for the part, but you can expect to pay anything from $5?$100. Fortunately, if you want to pay someone to fit it, labor will usually only be between 30 Minutes?1 Hour, depending on where the sensor is located."
Diagnosing a faulty oil pressure sensor ?	"Diagnosing a faulty oil pressure sensor is often pretty straightforward if you have the sensor?s correct measurements. The sensor does often have just one or two pins, which should have a specific resistance to ground. To know the exact resistance you need at a given oil pressure, you need to check your repair manual or the oil pressure sensor manufacturer?s manuals."
Can I drive with a faulty oil pressure sensor?	"If you have a faulty oil pressure sensor, it is best to replace it as soon as possible. The oil pressure sensor is responsible for monitoring the oil pressure in the engine and acting as a warning system if the pressure gets too low. This can help to prevent engine damage caused by low oil pressure. While you can drive with a faulty oil pressure sensor, it is not advisable to do so since there is a risk of engine damage if you can?t see when the oil pressure is low."
How long do oil pressure sensors last?	"Oil pressure sensors are designed to last a long time ? typically, the lifetime of the vehicle on most car models. It is also quite rare that they wear out. However, like any other component in your car, they can eventually fail."
How long does it take to replace an oil pressure sensor?	"It depends on the make and model of your vehicle, but generally speaking, it shouldn?t take more than 1 hour to replace an oil pressure sensor. However, if you?re not familiar with working on cars, it can take longer, and it?s always best to consult a professional mechanic to make sure the job is done correctly."
How do I reset my oil pressure sensor?	"There is no way to reset a normal oil pressure sensor. After you install the new one, just start the car engine. If everything else is good and there are no other issues with the oil pressure or wirings, and you should see the oil pressure light disappear."
Conclusion	"Due to the oil sensor?s simple design, they tend to be fairly cheap to pick up and easy to replace. Just be careful that you watch for oil leaking out as you remove the sensor from the engine block. You?ll also want to be careful that you don?t over-tighten your new sensor, as this is an easy mistake to make. Any time you work on a part of your engine that involves oil, it?s always best to wear gloves to protect your skin from the harmful chemicals that are built into the oil. Also, once the work is completed, check your oil level with your vehicle sitting on a flat, level surface and top up if required."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Ignition Coil  ?	"1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightThe check engine light illuminates if there is a problem with the engine. Since the ignition coil has a direct effect on the engine?s functioning, the check engine light starts to flash if there is a problem with the coil.If you have noticed any of the symptoms below and the check engine light, the problem is most likely with the ignition coil.2. Engine Backfires & MisfiresBackfire E1609774966542Engine backfiring is noticed in the early stages of an ignition coil failure. Backfiring occurs when there is an unburned fuel in the combustion cylinder, and it flows through the exhaust pipe.This also causes black smoke to escape from the exhaust pipe and a bad smell of gasoline, indicating that there may be a problem with the ignition coil. It is recommended that this problem be corrected immediately to avoid damage to the exhaust system.3. Engine StallingEngine Stall E1609780473516If you have a single ignition coil firing up a distributor ? common in old cars, your car might stall while driving. If you are driving at normal speed and after a few kilometers, you notice that your engine stops, there is a possibility that the ignition coil is defective. An engine stall occurs when the ignition coil delivers irregular current to the spark plug. If it is not repaired immediately, your car may come to a complete stop after a few miles.If you have a newer car with separate ignition coils, your car will most probably not stall while driving if just one ignition coil has gone bad.4. Poor Fuel EconomyCar High Cost E1609780565655Due to a defective ignition coil, your car engine might misfire and pour fuel out of the exhaust pipe without burning it, causing the engine to consume more fuel. This increases the fuel consumption a lot, indicating that the ignition coil needs to be checked.5. Strange Engine NoiseCar Engine Noise 1 E1609780485672A defective ignition coil does not generate enough voltage for the spark plug, so the engine works harder than usual.If your engine is running on one cylinder less than usual because of a bad ignition coil, your car might sound like a tractor and make strange engine noise.6. Car Does Not Start at AllHard StartingA damaged or faulty ignition coil can prevent the engine from starting completely. If you hear a clicking sound when starting the car, the problem is not with the ignition coil.However, if there is absolutely no sound, there is a possibility that the ignition system has failed, especially if you have an older car with a single ignition coil for all cylinders."
what is the The Function of the Ignition Coils ?	"The car?s ignition system aims to generate a high voltage from the car battery and transfer this voltage to the spark plugs. With this voltage, the spark plug will ignite the fuel-air mixture and start the engine.The ignition coil is basically a high voltage, low current transformer that takes voltage from the car?s 12-volt battery and converts it to 25-30,000 volts, which is needed by the spark plug for ignition."
where the Ignition Coil Location ?	"If you have separate ignition coils, the ignition coils are located on the top of the spark plugs, usually on the engine?s head.But if you have one separate ignition coil and a distributor, it is often installed at the car?s body, near the distributor."
what is the Ignition Coil Replacement Cost ?	"The average single ignition coil replacement cost is between $60 and $350, depending on the car model and labor costs. The cost of a single ignition coil is between $30 and $150. The labor cost of an ignition coil is between $30 and $200.The replacement of an ignition coil is often pretty straightforward, and you can easily replace it yourself, but in some car models, the job can take an hour or two; that?s why you should expect quite a high replacement cost in some cases.Changing the ignition coil is often easy, but if you don?t feel comfortable doing it yourself, go to the car mechanic and let the experts do the work."
What Does It Mean When An Engine Is Running Rich?	"When a car is running rich, it means the engine is injecting too much fuel and too little air for perfect combustion, a rich air-fuel mixture. This will not only lead to a high fuel consumption bill, but it can also cause damage to costly parts like the catalytic converter if you are unlucky.Therefore, if your engine is running rich, you should definitely consider fixing it as soon as possible to prevent further damage."
what are the Causes of Engine Running Rich ?	"The most common causes of your engine running rich are a faulty MAF sensor, O2 sensor, or MAP sensor. It can also be caused by a faulty coolant temp sensor, IAT sensor, or a faulty fuel pressure regulator.There are many parts that could cause a rich running engine because there are so many parts in an engine affecting the fuel mixture.This list by itself will probably not help you to solve the issue, so here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of your engine running rich.1. Faulty MAF SensorIntake And Maf SensorA faulty MAF sensor is the most common cause of an engine that is running rich.The MAF sensor calculates the airflow into the engine, and then calculating the air-fuel mixture that should be added. If the sensor is dirty or failed, it will cause the engine to run too rich or too lean. If the MAF sensor is faulty, it will calculate the wrong amount of air entering the engine, and add too much or too little fuel.2. Faulty O2 SensorOxygen O2 Sensor Location E1609865834690The O2 sensors are located on the exhaust pipe to sense the air-fuel mixture from the previous combustion.If the O2 sensor is getting information suggesting a lean mixture, it will tell the engine control unit to add more fuel during the next combustion and vice versa.If the O2 sensor is faulty, it might tell the engine control module to add more fuel, even if the air-fuel ratio is good, causing a rich fuel mixture.3. Faulty MAP SensorMap SensorSome cars have an MAP sensor instead of an MAF sensor. There are also cases when you can have both a MAP and MAF sensor.The MAP sensor calculates the air-fuel mixture based on the air pressure in the intake manifold. If you have an MAP sensor, it?s absolutely worth checking this part.Diagnosing the MAP sensor is quite easy with a diagnostic tool since you can check the pressure it shows when the engine is off, which should be the same pressure as the air pressure outside.4. Faulty Engine Coolant Temperature SensorCoolant Temperature SensorWhen the engine is cold, the engine needs more fuel to run properly. It is the engine coolant temperature sensor?s job to measure the coolant?s temperature and identify when it should add extra fuel to the engine.If the engine coolant temperature sensor is faulty, you may get a mixture that is too rich.5. Faulty Intake Temperature SensorIntake Temperature SensorThe intake temperature sensor calculates any additional fuel that should be added or restricted based on the temperature of the air entering the engine.The intake temperature sensor is often installed inside of the MAF sensor and can not be replaced separately.6. Faulty Fuel Pressure RegulatorFuel Pressure RegulatorA faulty fuel pressure regulator will cause the fuel pressure to get too high or too low. This can cause a mixture that is too rich.You will also want to check the vacuum hose to the fuel pressure regulator to ensure there are no leaks around it.7. Faulty InjectorFuel Injector LocationThe injectors are the ones handling the amount of fuel entering the engine. If one injector is not flowing as it should or is stuck open, it might cause a rich mixture in your engine."
what are the Symptoms  Engine Running Rich ?	"The main symptoms of a rich running engine include:Check Engine LightFuel smell from exhaustConstantly refilling your gas tankPoor engine performanceBlack smoke from exhaustHigh carbon monoxide contentSooty spark plugsHere is a more detailed list of the signs of a rich running engine to look for:1. Check the engine lightCheck Engine Light On Dashboard E1609869927250When the fuel to air ratio is high, you will have the check engine light coming on.The engine control module controls all the sensors, and if a sensor in your car misfunctions, it will light up the check engine light on your dashboard.2. Fuel smell from exhaustBad Car Smell E1609777166642If excess fuel is going to the combustion chambers, it means that some of it will not be fully ignited.The catalytic converter has a way of removing some of this fuel, but it will find its way to the exhaust system when it is in excess. Unburnt fuel smells like rotten eggs.3. Constantly refilling your gas tankRefuel CarOne of the symptoms of an engine running rich is that you do not get the right gas mileage. This is because the car does not need all the fuel being supplied. However, it is normal to spend more on gas during winter or when carrying heavy loads.4. Poor engine performanceSlow Acceleration CarFor your car?s engine performance to be normal, there has to be the right amount of fuel/air mixture. People often assume that if there is an overflow of fuel, the car will move faster, but that?s not true. Excess fuel does not get combusted ? it gets wasted.When you have problems with the air/fuel ratio, then you will experience low car performance. Also, you will notice that anytime your car is idle, the RPMs vary erratically.5. Black smoke from exhaustBlack Smoke From ExhaustWhen your engine is running rich, it will cause bad emissions. A rich air-fuel mixture will create black smoke, which will then come out of your exhaust pipe.If the emissions coming from your exhaust pipe make it look like you have a diesel engine (even though you don?t), it?s really time to check the air-fuel mixture.6. High carbon monoxide contentCar Emission TestCarbon monoxide is a dangerous exhaust gas. The catalytic converter works overtime to remove any traces of carbon monoxide in the exhaust. When your car?s engine is running rich, it means that you are producing more gas.This can be dangerous when you are in an enclosed room with poor ventilation. You also risk not passing state-sanctioned emissions tests.7. Sooty spark plugsSooty Spark PlugIf your engine is running rich, the spark plugs accumulate some black deposits at the bottom. This prevents them from operating efficiently. The soot will find its way to other engine parts, further causing damage.The unburnt fuel eventually finds its way to the catalytic converter, and due to the number of impurities, it will clog it. With time, you will be forced to dismantle it and replace it."
what are the Engine Running Rich Diagnosis ?	"Diagnosing an engine that is running rich is really not that simple. It often requires some diagnosis skills if you do want to waste money on just replacing parts.This is how a professional would do it, and you might need some extra tools to make it.Connect an OBD2 Scanner and check for related trouble codes. If you find any other trouble code regarding another sensor, start your diagnosing at the sensor.Check the live data values of the O2 sensor. Does it show that it is decreasing the fuel amount all the time? Then it is probably not any fault with this sensor.If you have access to one emission control tester or an external air-fuel meter, connect it, and check the actual air-fuel meter. If it shows that the fuel mixture is lean while the O2 sensor is telling you that the engine is rich and removing fuel, there is a problem with your O2 sensor, and it needs to be replaced.Check the values of all the temperature sensors, like the coolant and air temperature.Check the values of the MAF sensor or MAP sensor if you have one. Replace if faulty.Check the fuel pressure and ensure that the pressure is not too high on idle or on acceleration. Check the fuel pressure regulator or the vacuum hose to it if it is too high.You also want to look for technical service bulletins and recalls for your car model. Sometimes it can get fixed for free by your car?s manufacturer if there is a recall. For example, for some BMW and Mini vehicles you will find bulletins regarding rich fuel mixture."
Is it better to run rich or lean?	"While neither running too rich nor too lean is generally good for the engine, a lean engine is worse. Running the engine lean will cause a much higher temperature in the combustion chamber and can actually even melt the pistons if you are unlucky. A lean mixture can also cause detonations if the temperature gets so high that it self-ignites."
Can a rich running engine damage the engine?	"Yes. A rich running engine can cause a lot of issues. It can cause issues like fouled spark plugs, deposit buildup on the valves and pistons, and ultimately engine failure. If the engine runs so rich that the fuel does not ignite, unburned fuel can end up in the catalytic converter and destroy it."
What do spark plugs look like when running rich?	"Spark plugs that are running rich will be covered in soot and will be black in color. If you were to look at a spark plug that was running lean, it would be a light gray or white color. If you see a light-brown color, you are getting perfect combustion."
What does rich exhaust smell like?	What does rich exhaust smell like?
Conclusion	"A rich running engine is not good for the engine in the long run, nor is it good for your fuel costs. Therefore, it is important to know how to determine whether the engine is running rich or not.The most common symptoms of a rich running engine are excessive smoke coming from the exhaust, increased fuel consumption, a check engine light and a fuel smell. Your car may also fail the annual emissions test.Once you?ve looked at the symptoms and various causes of a rich running engine, it?s time to decide if it?s something you want to do yourself or leave to a professional. The best way to start a diagnosis when the engine runs rich is to use a diagnostic scanner. Whatever you choose, don?t ignore the problem, though! It will become more expensive in the long run."
what are the Causes of Car Vibrates or Shakes When Idling ?	"The most common reason your car is shaking when stopped or at idle is due to worn spark plugs or vacuum leaks. It can also be caused by loose or damaged engine mounts, a worn serpentine belt, a bad fuel pump, or any other fuel-related issues.The first thing you need to do when your car vibrates or shakes at idle is to check the trouble codes with an OBD-II scanner. If you can?t find any trouble codes or just can?t figure out what they mean, we have some possible causes here down below:Here is a more detailed list of the seven most common reasons why a car vibrates when stopped or at idle.1. Worn Spark PlugsCar Misfire Spark PlugsOne of the most common reasons for a rough idle is worn or damaged spark plugs. If you have worn spark plugs, your engine might misfire, which causes shaking or vibrations. If you have a faulty spark plug, you should have a check engine light on your dashboard, but that doesn?t always happen.The good news is that spark plugs are cheap, but you should replace them all if one goes bad. From there, you should change your spark plugs every 80,000 to 100,000 miles to prevent this problem from cropping up again!2. Loose or Disconnected Vacuum HosesCar Vacuum HosesWhether you know it or not, your vehicle is likely using vacuum hoses to power the air and fuel systems. If these hoses are torn or disconnected, the systems won?t work the way they should, and engine performance can suffer as a result.It?s not uncommon that when a vacuum problem gets bad enough, the engine misfires as a result. This misfire is what you?re noticing through vibrating or shaking.3. Broken or Loose Engine MountsEngine MountsYour motor mounts hold your engine in place, so it makes sense that the motor mounts might be the problem if you have a shaking or vibrating engine. Inspecting your vehicle?s motor mounts can be difficult, depending on what you drive.One easy way to check the motor mounts is to open the engine bay and have someone rev the engine while you?re looking at it. If the engine ?jumps,? then you have faulty motor mounts.Motor mounts themselves are relatively cheap, but it can be an extensive labor process to replace them.4. Worn Out BeltsSerpentine Belt CarThere might be multiple belts on your engine, but the two that every engine has are the serpentine belt and the timing belt. If either of these belts is worn or damaged, a rough idle is a typical result.Serpentine belts are easier to diagnose and easier to replace. Simply open the hood and identify the largest rubber belt around the front of your engine. Give it a slight tug; if it feels loose at all, that?s a problem.From there, check for cracks or tears along the belt. If you see signs of damage, replace the belt.For timing belts, you?ll need a more comprehensive repair, but often you?ll have a check engine light letting you know about the problem.5. Damaged or Clogged Fuel Intake/Fuel Pump/Fuel Injectors/FilterFuel FilterIf anything is going on with your fuel system, you?ll likely have a vibrating or shaking engine. That?s because if one of the engine?s cylinders isn?t getting enough fuel, it will throw the entire balance of the engine off.But even if you?ve identified it as a problem with your fuel system, there are a couple of different potential culprits. The first place to check should be your fuel filter. If your fuel filter is clogged, nothing will work the way it should, and it can even end up damaging other components.From there, you should look into your fuel injectors, fuel intake, or fuel pump. Many of these issues will cause a check engine light, which can help you narrow down the problem.6. Clogged Air FilterEngine Air Filter ReplacementJust like fuel is essential to your engine?s proper operation, air is a critical component. Fortunately for you, if the intake system is the problem causing your rough idle, the problem usually originates from the air filter.Simply pull the old air filter out and check if it?s extremely dirty. If it is, this might be your problem. Replace the air filter, reset the code, and see if the problem goes away! Air filters typically cost between $15 and $40, and most part stores will replace them for you for free.7. Faulty Camshaft TimingCamshaft Position Sensors E1609782937380Engine vibrations and shaking typically mean that your engine is misfiring for one reason or another. A potential reason for an engine misfire is faulty timing. If you just completed significant work on your engine, this is more common, but it?s not unheard of to have timing issues if the belt or chain is worn or damaged.If you need to replace your timing belt, it?s relatively expensive due to the labor involved."
what is the The Basic Mechanical Breakdown ?	"There are two main reasons that your engine might vibrate or shake while you?re idling, but the causes for these issues vary.The first issue is an engine misfire. This occurs when your engine?s spark plug fires at the wrong time or there isn?t enough fuel or air in the combustion chamber to match the rest of the engine?s performance. If you leave this problem alone, you risk damaging your engine block, requiring you to replace your engine.The second issue is a mounting issue. Your engine creates a lot of force, which is why the manufacturer mounts it to your vehicle?s frame, so it doesn?t move around. But if these mounts aren?t doing their job, your engine will shift around.By the time you?re feeling it when you idle, the problem is severe enough that you shouldn?t drive the vehicle anywhere before it?s repaired."
Conclusion	"While it can be tempting to ignore a rough idle for a while because your vehicle is still running, this is the last thing you want to do. The longer you let the problem go, the more likely it is to develop into something more serious.Before you give your engine a chance to break, fix the problem! If not, a problem that you could?ve fixed for a few hundred bucks might cost you a few thousand."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Water Pump ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad water pump are coolant leaks under your car and an overheating engine. You can sometimes also hear a squealing noise coming from the water pump if the bearings are bad. Unstable engine temperature is also common.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing water pump to look for:1. Leaking of CoolantCoolant Leaking E1609789888621When the water pump goes bad, it may leak from the axle sealing or any gasket. The water pump uses gaskets that ensure the coolant stays sealed and that the flow of water is uninterrupted. However, these gaskets can deteriorate and become completely useless in time, causing the coolant to leak out from under the water pump. If you have a puddle of water or coolant below the front end of your car, you are probably looking at water pump failure, and so you need to go to a mechanic.2. Squealing NoiseEngine Squealing Noise E1609789879322When the water pump goes bad, it may leak coolant into the bearings of the water pump, which will dry out the bearings of grease and therefore create a squealing noise when the engine is running. If you hear a squealing noise from the water pump you should replace the water pump as fast as possible, as it may be fatal to your engine to keep driving ? especially if the water pump is driven by the timing belt.3. Water Pump?s Axle loseWater Pump Bad E1609789871700There is a serpentine or timing belt making the water pump turn and pump coolant. If the water pump axle gets worn out, it may cause a loose belt. If this happens, you are looking at a complete replacement of the water pump. To feel if the water pump?s axle is loose, you have to remove the serpentine or timing belt. If you feel any play in the axle, replace it immediately.4. Overheating EngineOverheating Engine E1609789863111The water pump?s primary job is to pump coolant around the system to cool the engine. If the water pump fails somehow, you will see the temperature gauge rising on the dashboard. This can happen due to several reasons, such as thermostat failure or short electrical wiring, but you should always get it checked out by a certified mechanic. Otherwise, you are looking at widespread damage to the head gasket, the cylinders, and the pistons, all of which can reduce the overall life of your engine.5. White Smoke From The RadiatorWhite Smoke Radiator E1609789853150If you see white smoke coming out of your radiator, you are looking at a clear sign of water pump failure. The steam in the radiator is produced from an overheated engine, which can happen if the water pump is not working perfectly. When faced with this problem, it is better to stay safe and stop driving, wait for the engine to cool down, and try to reach your mechanic.6. Unstable Engine temperatureCar Temperature Meter E1609789949889You can also notice intermittent problems with the water pump, as the impeller might be loose on the water pump axle. This will cause the car to overheat sometimes, and at other times work fine for a couple of weeks. It?s always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to water pumps, though, so you should replace it if you think it?s bad."
What is a water pump?	"The water pump plays an important role in the healthy functioning of the engine. The pump regulates the amount of coolant that goes into the engine. Its job is to constantly supply the engine with fresh and cool liquid from the radiator to work properly.However, when the water pump fails ? and they do regularly fail ? the engine will not get the correct amount of coolant and heat up. That?s just how water-cooled engines work: if there is no water, the engine cannot survive.Therefore, a well-functioning water pump is of crucial importance. If it fails, some symptoms will appear, which will prompt you to contact the mechanic to ensure the engine is in good condition."
where the Water Pump Location ?	"The water pump is always located near the serpentine belt, timing belt, or timing chain since it is powered by one of them. This means that it is also installed at the front of the engine.If the timing belt powers the water pump, it may be difficult to see it though. You may need to remove a lot of covers to see it.Start by checking near the serpentine belt for the water pump pulley. If you can?t find the water pump pulley, there is a big risk that the timing belt powers it."
how to test Bad Water Pump ?	"The water pump is responsible for circulating coolant throughout the engine to maintain proper operating temperature. A malfunctioning water pump can lead to engine overheating and serious damage. Here are some steps to follow to test a bad water pump:Check for Coolant Leaks: Check for any signs of coolant leaks around the water pump. If there are any leaks, this could be an indication of a failing water pump.Check for Whining Noise: Listen for a whining noise coming from the water pump area. This can indicate that the water pump is failing or has failed.Check the Coolant Flow: With the engine running, observe the coolant flow through the radiator. If there is little or no flow, it could be an indication of a failing water pump.Check the Temperature: If the engine is overheating or running hotter than normal, it could be an indication of a failing water pump. This is because the water pump may not be circulating coolant effectively, leading to poor engine cooling.Check the Water Pump Pulley: Check the water pump pulley to ensure that it is not wobbling or loose. A wobbling or loose pulley could indicate a failing water pump bearing.Check the Weep Hole: Many water pumps have a weep hole located on the bottom of the housing. Check the weep hole for any signs of coolant leaking out. If coolant is leaking from the weep hole, it's a clear sign that the water pump needs to be replaced.It's important to note that water pump testing can be complicated and may require specialized equipment and knowledge. If you're not comfortable testing the water pump yourself, consider taking your vehicle to a mechanic or engine specialist for testing."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Crankshaft Pulley ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad crankshaft pulley are engine vibration and irregular engine idle. It may also result in a damaged alternator, power steering pump, or a failed transmission if you are unlucky.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing crankshaft pulley to look for:1. Engine VibrationCar Vibrates On IdleThe most prominent symptom that something is wrong with the crankshaft pulley is engine vibration. This will be the first sign you notice, as long as you are paying attention. The crankshaft pulley is often equipped with a harmonic balancer. This component absorbs vibration from the engine, allowing you to accelerate smoothly. However, when the balancer fails, vibrations are no longer absorbed. This defect causes noticeable shaking that gets worse the faster you go. 2. Irregular Engine IdleLow Idle RpmAs you sit in your vehicle parked, you become familiar with the sound of the idle. When something seems off, it could be related to your crankshaft pulley. Irregular engine RPMs are common with a bad crankshaft pulley because the dampener is put under more pressure, especially while idling. You might notice that the engine RPMs fluctuate all over the place. 3. Dead AlternatorBattery Alternator LightWhile the alternator charges the battery and runs accessories, the crankshaft pulley is responsible for supplying power to this component. If the crankshaft pulley fails, the alternator no longer turns and produces power. You will notice signs that look like you have a dead car battery. The lights might flicker and you won?t be able to start the vehicle for long, since the battery can?t be charged. 4. Failure of Power Steering PumpPower Steering Pump On TableThe car?s power steering pump is also powered up by the crankshaft pulley. This vital component pumps hydraulic fluid into the system so your steering works the way it should.When the power steering fails, it will require much more effort to control your vehicle. You might think that the system is low on fluid, but a simple check will show that?s not the case. 5. Damaged Transmission or Internal Engine PartsTransmission GearsIf you allow the engine vibration to occur long-term, it will lead to transmission or internal engine damage. It can wear out the crankshaft bearings if you are unlucky, and your car?s transmission has a lot of parts that aren?t made to handle that type of vibration. The gears, input shaft, and bearings are all susceptible to damage.When the transmission starts to fail, you might notice trouble shifting, whining sounds and leaking fluid. This is not something you want to deal with simply because you had a bad crankshaft pulley. "
what is the Crankshaft Pulley Function ?	"The car engine operates from the power given to it from the fuel. This power is then delivered from the engine to other components through the use of various electrical and mechanical systems. One of these mechanical systems is the crankshaft pulley, which is responsible for power distribution.The crankshaft pulley powers all of the components connected to the crankshaft. While the crankshaft will drive the car wheels, the pulley transmits power to other parts, such as the alternator and power steering pump.The crankshaft pulley includes an internal dampener, responsible for decreasing vibrations running along the pulley belts. If left unchecked, these vibrations can cause damage to the systems that are connected. While a torn or defective crankshaft pulley belt is simple to replace, a broken dampener requires a crankshaft pulley replacement. So, what causes a crankshaft pulley to go bad? Even though the part is designed to last the lifetime of your engine, it can fail easily. Most models have a rubber isolation ring that breaks down when exposed to high temperatures, which happens naturally because of the engine. Plus, if there is a coolant or oil leak that gets on the pulley, it can contaminate it and speed up deterioration. "
where the Crankshaft Pulley Location ?	"The crankshaft pulley, otherwise known as a harmonic balancer, is found on the end of the crankshaft. It?s a wheel-shaped device with grooves that connect directly onto the crankshaft. While the crankshaft is responsible for converting straight or linear movement to the pistons, the crankshaft pulley connects to several other components through the use of accessory belts. "
what is the Crankshaft Pulley Replacement Cost ?	"The crankshaft pulley replacement cost is between $350 and $400, depending on the car model and labor costs. You could spend $200 to $240 for a new crankshaft pulley, plus about $150 for labor.If you purchase an aftermarket crankshaft pulley, you could save yourself a little money. Luxury cars might cost slightly more overall. If you wanted to replace the crankshaft pulley yourself, the job isn?t that complicated. Remove all of the engine drive belts.Take off the crankshaft pulley bolt. You will need a pulley holder and a high torque impact wrench.Remove the old pulley.Install the new crankshaft pulley.Put the bolt back on and tighten it.Re-install all of the engine drive belts. "
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Hydraulic Lifter ?	"The most common symptom of a bad hydraulic lifter is a misfiring engine on idle or when accelerating, together with engine noise. It will in most cases also result in a check engine warning light on your dashboard.Just because hydraulic lifters are a technical component that you don?t see doesn?t mean that it won?t break. Hydraulic lifters wear out, and when they do, it leads to big problems.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing hydraulic lifter to look for:1. Excessive Engine NoiseCar Engine NoiseIf one of your vehicle?s hydraulic lifters is stuck or broken, you?re going to hear it. Not only can you hear the clanging of metal as they rub against each other, but you can also hear the internals of the hydraulic lifter hammering against itself.As you speed up your vehicle to higher RPMs, these sounds will become louder and more frequent as the lifter attempts to actuate faster and faster and is unable to do so.2. Engine MisfiresCar MisfiresThe hydraulic lifters connect to the pushrods (In some car models), which connect to the rocker arms, which control the intake and exhaust valves. So, if the hydraulic lifter isn?t working the way that it should, then your exhaust or intake valves won?t open and close when they should.This means that your engine won?t produce the necessary combustion, which leads to misfires. As your engine misfires, you?ll hear a difference in sound and notice a drop in performance. If your engine is misfiring, you need to get it to a repair shop as soon as possible, before more damage occurs.3. Broken Pushrods and Dead CylindersCar Engine Push RodsIf your car engine is an overhead valve engine, it has pushrods that connect the camshaft and the intake or exhaust valve. These can break down if your hydraulic lifter is bad.The whole reason your engine has a lift cylinder is so the pushrod gets pushed the exact same way every time. If you have a broken hydraulic lift cylinder, it?s not uncommon for the pushrods to become bent or broken, too.If this happens, you won?t just have an exhaust valve or intake valve that isn?t working optimally ? you?ll have one that isn?t working at all. When the cylinder stops working completely, it?s called a ?dead cylinder,? and you?re going to notice a significant drop in performance.Additionally, you?re going to notice that your engine doesn?t sound right. If you have a dead cylinder, you need to get it checked out immediately, and this is about more than restoring your engine?s horsepower. If you have a dead cylinder and don?t repair it, it?s only a matter of time until you cause further damage to your engine.4. Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light On Dashboard E1609869927250There are sensors everywhere in your engine. They monitor everything from the amount of air the intake brings in to the chemical composition of your exhaust. Everything about your vehicle is a fine-tuned machine, and it needs as many inputs as possible to keep it that way.So, it makes sense that if everything isn?t working the way it should, some of these sensors will pick up a problem. There are multiple warning lights that might turn on if you have a faulty hydraulic lift cylinder, but one thing is for sure ? you will get a check engine light."
what is the Hydraulic Lifter Function ?	"Your vehicle?s hydraulic lifters? only job is to transfer the force from the camshaft lobe to the valves. For the valves to remain closed, they need a little bit of play between the camshaft and the valve because metal moves when it is warm. This is the job of the hydraulic lifter to control this play.Hydraulic lifters have an advantage over mechanical lifters because they sit directly against the camshaft lobes, where traditional lifters have to leave a small space for expansion when they heat up.While the exact way the lifter operates is slightly different, they serve the same function. While most vehicles still utilize hydraulic lifters, mechanical lifters are starting to make a bit of a comeback due to their lower cost.While there?s no wrong choice, solid or mechanical lifters aren?t maintenance-free, and you?ll notice a slight dip in performance, which is why hydraulic lifters made their way into vehicles, to begin with."
how to make Hydraulic Lifters Testing and  Cleaning ?	"Hydraulic lifters are an important component in the valve train system of an internal combustion engine. They work to provide a controlled and consistent movement of the engine's valve system. Over time, hydraulic lifters can become dirty and clogged, resulting in decreased engine performance. To ensure proper function, it is important to regularly test and clean your hydraulic lifters.Here are the steps to test and clean hydraulic lifters:Materials:Hydraulic lifter cleaner solutionSmall plastic containerAir compressorClean rags or paper towelsTesting the Lifters:Remove the hydraulic lifters from the engine.Fill a small plastic container with hydraulic lifter cleaner solution.Submerge the lifters in the cleaner solution for at least an hour.After soaking, remove the lifters from the solution and place them on a clean rag or paper towel.Using an air compressor, blow compressed air into the lifters to check if they are working correctly. The lifters should fully compress and then slowly extend back out when the air pressure is released.Cleaning the Lifters:If the lifters are found to be clogged or dirty, repeat steps 2-4 from the testing process.After soaking, use the air compressor to blow out any remaining cleaner solution from the lifters.Allow the lifters to air dry completely before reinstalling them back into the engine.Note: Always refer to your vehicle's manufacturer guidelines for specific instructions on how to test and clean your hydraulic lifters, as some engines may require additional steps or specific cleaning solutions."
where the Hydraulic Lifters Location ?	"Hydraulic lifters are located directly between your engine?s camshaft and the valves in most car models, but some car models have push rods and rocker arms between the camshaft and valves, too.As the camshaft?s location can vary, this makes it a little harder to pinpoint if your hydraulic lifters will be at the top or the bottom of your engine.But if you find your camshaft and your vehicle has hydraulic lifters, that?s where they?ll be. Even if your vehicle doesn?t have hydraulic lifters, there will be some kind of mechanical lifter there. You?ll never see a vehicle that has a camshaft push directly against the pushrods or valves."
what is the Hydraulic Lifter Replacement Cost ?	"The average hydraulic lifter replacement cost is between $100 and $1100, depending on the car model and labor cost. A single hydraulic lifter costs $5 to $30 while labor costs $100 to $1000.Hydraulic lifters are one of those components that are cheap to buy but expensive to replace. That?s because each hydraulic lifter only costs between $5 and $30, but getting to them is a job and a half. Also, while each individual lifter might be expensive, you should replace them all at once, and your engine has a lot of them.In fact, your engine has anywhere from eight to twenty-four lifters, depending on what you drive. That takes the cost for parts alone to anywhere from $40 to $1,000.Additionally, the labor costs for replacing lifters can range anywhere from $300 to $700. That means if you?re lucky, you can get the job done for under $400, but if you?re unlucky, it can cost as much as $1,700. The average cost usually sits between $500 to $800."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Secondary Air Injection Pump ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad secondary air pump are a check engine light, engine performance issues and a failed emissions test. But while those are the most common symptoms, they aren?t the only thing you need to look out for.Below we?ve highlighted a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing secondary air injection pump to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightYour vehicle?s manufacturer fills it to the brim with sensors, and these sensors monitor just about everything that your car does. So, it?s no surprise that if you have a faulty secondary air injection pump one of these sensors will tell the ECM to let you know through a check engine light.The most common code you?ll run across is a P0410, a Secondary Air Injection System Malfunction. However, you might also get a code for an oxygen sensor or your catalytic converter. If that?s the case, you have a check engine light because of one of the symptoms, not the cause.That?s why it?s always best to hook up an OBD II scan tool to your vehicle when making diagnostic repairs ? that way, you diagnose the problem correctly the first time.2. Failed Emissions TestCars Emission Test E1609865644244Your secondary air injection pump is an emissions component, so it?s no surprise that if it?s acting up, you?re not going to pass an emissions test. The more fresh air that your catalytic converter gets, the better it can do its job.Moreover, most emissions tests will automatically fail you if you have an emissions-related check engine light. While we?ll dive into how this component works later on, just know that if it?s acting up, you?ll never pass an emissions test ? even if you don?t have an active check engine light.3. Slow AccelerationSlow AccelerationYour secondary air injection pump monitors the hydrocarbon levels coming out of the engine, and if it?s getting the wrong readings, it can tell your ECM that something isn?t going right inside the combustion chamber. This can lead to performance problems like slower acceleration.4. Stalling Engine or Reduced Power OutputEngine StallAnother set of performance problems that can come from errant readings from the secondary air injection pump is a stalling engine or reduced power output. This is because your engine is changing the overall performance based on errant readings, which in turn creates actual problems as it tries to run.This is why you should fix a faulty secondary air injection pump as soon as possible. Otherwise, you might run into problems as you drive, and these problems will only worsen over time.5. Low IdleLow Idle RpmSometimes the only performance problem to come up is a low idle. That?s because as you press the accelerator, your vehicle produces more hydrocarbons, which can be enough to get the sensor working as it should. This gets the ECM back to sending the correct readings to the engine.However, the longer the problem goes on, the more likely the problem will continue at higher RPMs."
where the Secondary Air Injection Pump Location ?	"The secondary air injection pump is usually located on the engine or at least in the engine bay. It can sometimes be hidden deep into the engine bay, but mostly you will find it installed pretty visible on the engine.You can locate it by looking for something like the picture here above or below. It a hose going to the intake, so follow this hose."
what is The Function of a Secondary Air Injection Pump ?	"The secondary air injection pump is an emissions component that lowers emissions by pumping in fresh air just before the catalytic converter.While this might seem like it?s cheating the emissions system by lowering the percentage of hydrocarbons in the exhaust, that?s not how the testing works, and it actually increases the number of hydrocarbons your catalytic converter can convert into water.Simply put, the more fresh air that your vehicle has in the exhaust system, the more effective the catalytic converter is at its job."
how to Test A Secondary Air Pump ?	"The secondary air pump is an important component of a vehicle's emissions control system, helping to reduce harmful emissions. If the secondary air pump is not functioning properly, it can lead to a decrease in engine performance and increased emissions. Here are the steps to test a secondary air pump:Materials:MultimeterWiring diagram for your vehicleJumper wireTesting the Secondary Air Pump:Locate the secondary air pump in your vehicle. It is typically located near the front of the engine bay.Disconnect the electrical connector from the secondary air pump.Use a multimeter to check for voltage at the electrical connector. Refer to your vehicle's wiring diagram to identify the correct wires to test.If there is no voltage present, check the fuses and wiring leading to the secondary air pump to ensure there are no breaks or damaged connections.If voltage is present, use a jumper wire to connect the positive terminal of the battery to the positive terminal on the secondary air pump. The secondary air pump should turn on and begin running.If the secondary air pump does not turn on, it may be faulty and need to be replaced. If it does turn on, the issue may lie elsewhere in the emissions control system.Note: Always refer to your vehicle's manufacturer guidelines for specific instructions on how to test the secondary air pump, as some vehicles may require additional steps or specific testing equipment."
what is the Secondary Air Injection Pump Replacement Costs ?	"The average secondary air injection pump replacement cost is between $250 and $400. This is significantly cheaper than replacing the primary air pump, which can cost from $600 to $700.Keep in mind that the exact cost for your vehicle?s repairs will vary depending on what you drive and where you take it in for repairs.If you?re looking to save a little money when you?re replacing your secondary air injection pump, you can swap the parts out yourself. However, the parts themselves range from $200 to $300, while the labor usually costs less than $100.But if you can jack up your vehicle and reach the secondary air injection pump, then the job itself is relatively straightforward, so it?s not hard to save a little bit of money. Just make sure that you properly jack up and secure the vehicle so you don?t get crushed while swapping the parts."
How to Bypass Oxygen Sensors?	"While you can bypass an oxygen sensor with the help of a dummy O2 sensor, it?s not always the best option. In some cases, it could be illegal, and in other cases, it can mess with the performance of the vehicle. However, it?s easy to do. You just have to swap the defective sensor with a dummy.Here are some detailed steps on how to bypass an oxygen sensor:1. Prepare the CarYou don?t want to work with a hot car. Instead, allow it to cool down completely before getting started. It could take several hours for the exhaust to cool completely after driving.Disconnect the negative battery cable from the terminal. Simply loosen the nut and slide the clamp away from the terminal.2. Lift VehicleYou want to get your vehicle up in the air, so you have more room to work. Using the front jack point of the vehicle, jack up the car. Put jack stands under the frame towards the front of the vehicle. Gently lower the vehicle back down on the stands. 3. Disconnect O2 SensorFind the O2 sensor that needs to be removed. It should be part of the exhaust system, and it resembles a plug. You may find it in the catalytic converter or before and after it, run by two separate sensors.Carefully unplug the wiring attached to the sensor. You must squeeze the tab to release it before pulling it away from its housing. Finally, turn it counterclockwise using a special oxygen sensor removal tool. 4. Insert Dummy O2 SensorInstall your new dummy sensor, otherwise known as an O2 sensor simulator. You put it in by turning the sensor clockwise, just as if you were replacing it with a new O2 sensor. Connect the wiring to the sensor and lower the vehicle back down to the ground. You are ready to start the car and see if the Check Engine Light has gone off. You may also need to drive it for a short distance to get the light off. Remember that depending on where you live, it can be illegal to install a dummy O2 sensor!"
Should I Bypass Oxygen Sensors?	"Bypassing the oxygen sensor with a dummy can be done. Many people will do this to get the Check Engine Light to turn off when emissions aren?t right or to allow for more flexibility when tuning the engine. If you want to remove the first sensor before the catalytic converter, you will need an O2 sensor simulator, which can be found online. If you want to remove the second sensor behind the catalytic converter to get rid of the P0420 or P0421 code, you can often use an adapter like this.However, it?s not legal in all parts of the country, so you want to check your local laws before performing this hack. Additionally, you won?t want to mess with the oxygen sensor found before the catalytic converter unless you know how to tune the engine. This O2 sensor is responsible for controlling the fuel and air mixture, so the performance of the engine could suffer without it.The O2 sensor working with the catalytic converter is there strictly to monitor emissions. Removing this one doesn?t change how the car runs; it just keeps you from knowing when the car is working as it should. "
What are Oxygen Sensors?	"The oxygen sensor is otherwise referred to as the lambda sensor. It?s been around since the 1960s and was originally designed for Bosch. This electronic sensor measures how much oxygen is in gas. While the original design contained platinum and ceramic-coated zirconia, planar sensors soon became the norm for mass production.NTK created the modern O2 sensor in 1990, originally to be used in several Honda models. It was created from High-Temperature Cofired Ceramic (HTCC), making it more efficient. Now, all modern cars feature oxygen sensors.This sensor can be found in the emissions system. It?s responsible for sending data about the oxygen levels back to the engine computer where adjustments can be made. It has a profound impact on the performance of the vehicle and alerts you to trouble with emissions. If you live in a state that requires emissions testing, a faulty oxygen sensor could fail you. At a bare minimum, there is one O2 sensor before the catalytic converter. There can also be a sensor in every exhaust manifold, so it?s difficult to know how many each car has. In many of today?s vehicles, there can be four oxygen sensors. "
How to Test an Oxygen Sensor ?	"If you think there?s a bad oxygen sensor on your vehicle, you can test it. You will need a back probe and a digital voltmeter. To test the O2 sensor, you must first find the wires that run to it. Give these wires a visual inspection to ensure there is no damage and everything looks good. If there?s wear and tear, you want to replace the sensor.If everything looks good, you want to start the car engine. Allow it to run until it reaches at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. This step ensures that the reading will be accurate. Turn off the engine temporarily while you set up the connectors. With your voltmeter and back probe, measure the oxygen sensor at a few different points to see if the measurements are faulty. You can connect the back probe to the signal wire and connect the voltmeter?s positive lead to the back probe. Next, you will connect the voltmeter?s negative lead to a ground on the chassis. Set the voltmeter to the 1-volt scale. Start the vehicle and check the voltmeter?s reading. It should change quickly. If it is only reading 0.5 volts, the vehicle might not be warmed enough. If it isn?t changing after the engine is warmed, there is something wrong with the sensor. You can also create a vacuum leak to check how the sensor deals with a lean mixture. There?s also the option to do a propane enrichment test. If you aren?t familiar with either of these, it might be best to visit a mechanic for professional guidance."
How do I turn off the rear o2 sensor?	"To turn off the rear O2 sensor, simply remove it from the car. It will however light up the check light on your dashboard and to get rid of it, you will either need to install an O2 sensor simulator or reprogram the ECM. These procedures can be illegal depending on where you live, so check the laws and rules first."
What happens if you cut off your o2 sensors?	"If you cut off your O2 sensors, you will not receive oxygen readings from your car and it will run on simulated values. This means that your car will not be able to adjust the air/fuel mixture to compensate for any changes in altitude or weather conditions, and it may cause your car to run poorly or even damage the engine. You will also see a check engine light on your dashboard."
Are oxygen sensors necessary?	"Yes. Oxygen sensors are necessary in order to maintain the fuel/air mixture in the cylinders. If there is no oxygen sensor, the ECU will not know when to adjust the fuel/air mixture, and your car will either run too rich (lots of unburned fuel) or too lean (not enough fuel). This will cause decreased performance, increased emissions, and possibly even engine damage."
How do I make an O2 simulator?	"There are a few different ways to make an O2 simulator. The most common way is to install resistors instead of O2 sensors. The resistors you need depend on the car model you drive and the type of sensor installed. However, this is easier to do with the rear O2 sensor than the front, as the upstream sensor needs values to control the air/fuel mixture."
Conclusion	"To bypass an oxygen sensor in a car, you can either use a dummy oxygen sensor or replace it with a resistor with the correct resistance. However, bypassing oxygen sensors may be illegal depending on where you live and you will end up with a check engine light or performance issues unless you reprogram the engine control module for the removal of the oxygen sensor.Bypassing the downstream oxygen sensor is the most common way to get rid of the P0420 code. Bypassing this sensor will not affect engine performance, but you will need to reprogram the ECU to get rid of the check engine light.Bypassing the upstream oxygen sensor is much more difficult due to the importance of the sensor in operating the engine with an optimal air-fuel mixture.I hope you now have the knowledge to determine whether or not to bypass the oxygen sensors in your car.

what are the Symptoms of Bent or Bad Engine Valves ? 	"The main symptoms of bent engine valves include:Check engine lightEngine backfiresLow CompressionShaking engineLack of PowerExcessive Oil ConsumptionHere is a more detailed list of the signs of bent engine valves to look for:1. Check Engine LightFlashing Check Engine LightModern cars monitor all sensors in your car engine in real-time to make sure its performance is optimal. If something is wrong with any of the sensors or if any parameter is out of range, it will light up the check engine light on your dashboard.If any of your engine valves are bent, it will definitely result in a check engine light. You can check the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner to look for any air-fuel mixture related trouble codes.The engine valves are not electronic, and therefore the trouble codes will not directly say that an engine valve is bent, but it may say something about misfires or wrong air-fuel mixture.2. Engine BackfiresBackfireIf an exhaust valve is bent, it affects how the fumes leave the cylinder. The exhaust valves need to open and close at precise times to ensure the right amount of pressure is always present.A bent exhaust valve can end up in the wrong position. It can also fail to seal properly when closed. This defect causes an exhaust leak that affects the way the fuel is combusted. When the ECU notices the problem, it might overcompensate by changing how much fuel gets delivered to the cylinder. When the cylinder runs rich, unburnt fuel leaks into the exhaust, creating a backfire or popping sound.3. Low CompressionCompression TestWhen the engine is running, there is pressure building up inside the cylinder, known as compression. Bent engine valves commonly lead to an imbalance of compression. When this pressure is too low, the combustion process is affected and the fuel cannot burn correctly.The bent engine valve creates low compression because it no longer closes securely, thereby leaving the seal defective with the cylinder head. As air or exhaust escapes, the compression is thrown off, causing a lack of power and other performance complaints. If you notice low compression during a compression test, it is definitely time to check your engine valves to make sure they are not leaking.4. Shaking EngineBent engine valves are notorious for changing the way the engine runs. If a valve is damaged by something such as a broken timing belt, the motor could start to shake due to misfires. You might notice this more often when idling or driving at slower speeds.Depending on how badly the valve is damaged, you might be able to drive for a short time. However, severely damaged valves can cause the engine to cease operating entirely. 5. Lack of PowerBent engine valves almost always lead to a lack of power. In many cases, these power issues come from a reduction of pressure in the cylinder caused by the damaged valve. When the valve doesn?t close correctly or sit where it should, the combustion mixture will be thrown off.Additionally, the power issues can come from the engine running rich to compensate for the problems caused by the bent valve. Either way, it must be repaired ? the problem will only get worse over time. 6. Excessive Oil ConsumptionEngine valves must be lubricated to work correctly. With the help of the valve seal, the stem of the valve is lubricated with oil when it moves. However, the oil is stopped from moving into the cylinder with the help of the valve seal.A worn or damaged seal can occur when the valve bends. These broken seals allow oil to seep into the combustion chamber. This defect causes an excessive amount of oil to burn. It can also affect how the engine runs and can damage the catalytic converter if it isn?t fixed quickly. If you see blue smoke from your exhaust pipe, that can be caused by a bent engine valve which causes the valve seal to leak."
What are Engine Valves?	"Valves are the parts that help control air movement through the motor. During the intake stroke, intake valves open to allow air into the combustion chamber. During the exhaust stroke, exhaust valves open to permit the burnt combustion out of the chamber.When the compression stroke occurs, both the intake and exhaust valves must stay closed to build up pressure before the combustion mixture can be ignited. This combustion force gives your car its power.Inside the cylinder head is where you will find the exhaust and intake valves. The majority of vehicles have two of each per cylinder. Therefore, a four-cylinder motor contains 16 total valves. However, some LS V8 engines used by GM only contain a single exhaust and intake valve per cylinder, giving you a total of 16 valves. "
How to Test Bent Engine Valves ?	"To test for a bent engine valve, the ideal check would require you to remove the cylinder head and take a physical look at the valve. However, this is more work than most people want to deal with, which is why compression tests and leak-down tests are handy.With a compression test, you can quickly see how much compression each cylinder produces. It?s a simple way to see how the engine is performing.If you find that one cylinder is low, you will move on to the leak-down test. With this diagnostic, you can tell when the air is leaking out of the engine. The leak-down test gets hooked up to the spark plug hole. Once that is accomplished, the crankshaft gets turned until the cylinder is at the compression stroke. This is when you hear where the air is rushing out of the engine. If the air is coming from the intake, it?s likely you are dealing with a bent intake valve. On the other hand, air coming from the exhaust points to a bent exhaust valve. However, air coming out of these locations could also mean that there is just carbon buildup on the valves leading to a poor seal. Further diagnostics might be needed from a qualified mechanic if you are unsure."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Car Thermostat ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad thermostat are an overheating engine or an engine that will never reach the operating temperature. You may also notice a fluctuating temperature on the temperature gauge.The symptoms give you a warning in advance to take the necessary precautions. Here is a more detailed list of the most common signs of a bad or failing thermostat to look for:1. Overheating EngineOverheating Engine On Road E1609868232525When the car thermostat remains stuck closed, the hot coolant cannot flow to the radiator. Because the hot fluid cannot be cooled down, it keeps the temperature of the engine up higher than normal.Coolant needs to make its way to the radiator to be cooled down. Once this occurs, it comes back to the engine and dissipates more of the heat. However, with the stuck thermostat, the coolant remains stagnant, continuing to build up more heat.If the engine overheats, it can cause serious damage. For example, if you end up with a blown head gasket, you are looking at massive repair bills.However, an overheating engine isn?t always caused by a bad thermostat. You want to check the coolant levels to ensure you have enough fluid in the system. It could also be due to a bad water pump or a cooling system leak. Additionally, the radiator could become clogged. Still, the thermostat should be one of the parts you examine. 2. Trouble Reaching Operating TemperatureIf the opposite were true from the above complaint, the thermostat would be stuck open. When this happens, the coolant is able to flow freely to the radiator. Without coolant sitting in the engine for an extended period of time, the operating temperature might fail to reach normal limits. Not only will the engine struggle to increase temperature, but it will also have trouble maintaining its range.When the engine doesn?t get warm enough, it?s going to be less efficient. You might notice that the motor is using more fuel than usual, costing you additional money at the pump. This problem can also lead to premature wear of the engine components. 3. Temperature FluctuationsFluctating Temperature Gauge E1609868224282When the thermostat starts to fail, it might operate erratically. Sometimes, it could be stuck open when it should be closed and vice versa. This malfunction leads to temperature fluctuations in the engine that aren?t normal. When the thermostat doesn?t fail uniformly, it can create mixed signals. You will notice strange temperature readings, leading you to wonder what is causing the problem. However, a quick check of the thermostat might reveal that this is the culprit. 4. Heater fluctuationsFluctating Heat Temperature E1609868216893The coolant heats up the heater in your car. Therefore, if the thermostat is not doing its job properly to maintain an even temperature in the car?s engine, you may experience temperature fluctuations inside the car from the vents.If both your temperature gauge and the heat inside the car fluctuate, it is definitely time to check the thermostat.5. Possible Leakages & Steam from the engineWhite Steam From Engine E1609868206958If the thermostat is not working properly, the hot coolant in the engine coolant chamber will find a way to escape because of too high pressure. We all know that hot air rises and that water boils and forms steam when it heats up.When the coolant heats up, and the pressure gets too high, it can attack the weak points and cause a leak. The coolant is often pressed out of the radiator tankLeaks are often straightforward to detect because they are visible and often show up in white steam smoke.6. Rising Temperature and Full Expansion TankExpansion Tank E1609868242307If the thermostat flap remains closed, no coolant can escape from the radiator. The coolant inside heats up and begins to convert to steam, while the coolant inside the radiator remains unchanged.So if you see the temperature gauge rise and the radiator tank is filled with water, you most likely have a problem with the thermostat. A rising coolant level can also mean that the car is about to overheat.7. Poor PerformanceThe thermostat is a critical component designed to ensure that the engine is always running at its optimal temperature. Without it, the engine won?t operate as it should.When the motor isn?t running right, you are going to notice performance issues. Most notably, the fuel economy is going to suffer as the engine works harder to compensate for the temperature discrepancies. If the engine is overheating or unable to reach temperature, there could also be increased emissions from the fault. Not only is the bad thermostat putting the engine at risk for failure, but it?s also contributing to a polluted environment. "
How Does a Car Thermostat Work?	"The car thermostat?s job is to keep the engine?s temperature within its working limits. This small part sits between the engine and radiator, regulating coolant flow between the two parts. When the thermostat closes, the coolant isn?t able to flow. When it?s open, coolant flows to dissipate heat. Most car engines from the past few years operate at the same temperature range to ensure maximum performance. In general, the car engine should be around 195 to 220 degrees Fahrenheit. When it doesn?t run within these temperature guidelines, it?s not operating efficiently. When coolant is kept from flowing to the radiator, the engine temperature increases rapidly. On the other hand, as the coolant flows into the radiator, heat is quickly dissipated. The car thermostat operates as a gatekeeper. It?s either allowing or blocking coolant from flowing from the motor into the vehicle?s radiator. It?s the job of the thermostat to read the temperature of the engine and determine if the coolant needs to flow or not. If the engine is hot, the thermostat opens up and allows the coolant to move. Otherwise, when the engine remains cold, the thermostat stays closed. "
where the Thermostat Location ?	"The thermostat is often located in a plastic or metal housing near the water pump, connecting to the radiator?s lower hose.It is most often located on the housing that connects the radiator?s lower hose, but it can be the upper hose in some cars.Because it is often installed inside a housing, it is in most cases impossible to see with your own eyes without removing it, so using a repair manual is a good way to find the exact location of your car model."
what is the Thermostat Replacement Cost ?	"The average thermostat replacement cost is between $70 and $450, depending on the car model and labor costs. A thermostat costs around $20 to $50, and the labor cost at a workshop is between $50 and $400.Some cars have a whole housing with the thermostat integrated, making it impossible to replace the thermostat alone. This can make the part very expensive.On some cars, the thermostat is placed really badly, requiring some hours of work, while on other cars, you can replace it yourself within 10 minutes.Check a repair manual to find out how much work it is to replace the thermostat on your car model."
How to Test a Bad Thermostat ?	"It doesn?t take a lot of mechanical knowledge to test the car thermostat. In fact, a simple visual exam is all you need to perform.Start by taking off the radiator cap. It?s under the hood, near the front of the vehicle, mounted to the radiator. Don?t ever open the radiator cap when the engine is hot. This test should only be done with a cold engine. Turn the car on and allow the motor to run. As you look inside the neck, you should not see coolant flowing to the radiator. As the engine is cool, the fluid should not be moving inside. If you already see coolant running, the thermostat is open when it shouldn?t be. If the coolant isn?t flowing while the engine is cold, everything is running as it should so far. Now, you want to allow the motor the chance to warm up. However, you need to be careful with the hot coolant, as it can cause injury.As the temperature rises in the motor, coolant will start flowing into the radiator. If you don?t see any coolant moving but the temperature is rising on the dashboard, the thermostat might be stuck closed. In either situation, you must address the problem to prevent further damage to your engine."
Can I drive with a bad thermostat?	"No. It?s not recommended to drive your car with a bad thermostat. If your thermostat is malfunctioning, it could cause your engine to overheat, which could lead to serious engine damage. It?s always best to get a faulty thermostat fixed as soon as possible. Otherwise, you?re risking some very costly repairs down the road."
Can I run a car without a thermostat?	"Although you can drive a car without a thermostat, it is not recommended. If you remove the thermostat, your car will not reach operating temperature. This will cause higher fuel consumption and wear your engine down faster."
Is it hard to change a car thermostat?	"Replacing a thermostat can be quite a tricky job for many people. Replacing the thermostat itself is often not that difficult, but properly bleeding the coolant system afterward can be tricky. In some car models, it can be very difficult to reach the thermostat as well."
Do I have to drain the coolant when replacing the thermostat?	"Yes. In most car models, the thermostat is located at the bottom of the coolant system, so when you remove the thermostat, you have no choice ? all the coolant in the engine drains by itself. Some car models have the thermostat placed quite high up, and in this case, it may be enough just to drain part of the coolant."
Differences between the Timing Chain and Timing Belt  ?	"The biggest difference between a timing chain and a timing belt is noise and life expectancy. A chain is often maintenance-free, while a timing belt must be replaced at a fixed interval. A timing belt is quieter without the same noise as a timing chain.This is just a quick answer to your question, and there is much more to it. Read on to learn everything you have to know about the differences to find out which one is better."
What Is a Timing Belt/Timing Chain?	"As the name implies, timing belts and timing chains control the timing of your engine. It connects your crankshaft to the camshaft, and this controls when each intake and exhaust valve opens and closes. Without this critical component, your engine wouldn?t run, and you?d likely total your engine in a matter of minutes ? if not seconds.This is an extremely important component, even if you can?t see it. That?s because both timing belts and timing chains are covered, and you have to remove a ton of different components to reach them.Moreover, when you?re replacing a timing belt or timing chain, it?s not only a labor-intensive process but a technical one as well. Because if you accidentally line up the new belt or chain to the wrong grooves, you?ll have a mistimed engine, and that can quickly lead to a lot of damage.So, if you need to replace your vehicle?s timing belt or timing chain and don?t know what you?re doing, it?s best if you take your vehicle to a certified mechanic instead of trying to figure it out yourself. While it can be tempting to try and save a few bucks upfront, the long-term effects simply aren?t worth the risk."
what is the Timing Chains ?	"Timing chains are thick metal chains that connect your camshaft to your crankshaft. You?ll probably never need to replace a timing chain, but you might need to replace the guides that keep your timing chain in place.But most manufacturers don?t recommend changing these guides for at least 150,000 miles, and sometimes it?s an even longer interval. The advantage of a timing chain is that once it?s in your vehicle, you?ll probably never need to change it, which saves you money in maintenance in the long run.However, many manufacturers opt for timing belts instead of timing chains because they?re cheaper upfront. This allows them to save some money on manufacturing costs and make a little more profit without raising the vehicle?s cost.This is a cost that gets passed onto you in the unlikely event your vehicle has a timing chain and it breaks. The average cost to replace a timing chain can exceed $1,600, which is far more than the average cost to replace a timing belt.Moreover, sometimes a timing chain is a little louder than a timing belt. But as vehicle technologies advance, manufactures have found ways to make timing chains just as quiet as timing belts. But if you?re looking at an older vehicle, this might be a concern.You need to consider that many modern car models have problems with the timing chains, which can be very costly; proper research is needed for your specific car model before making a choice.ProsThey last much longer, and you rarely need to replace themConsThey are more expensive upfrontIf you do need to replace it, it?s far more expensiveOften louder than timing belts"
what is the  Timing Belts ?	"Timing belts are far less durable than timing chains. Instead of a thick metal chain, a timing belt uses a rubber belt that?s similar to your vehicle?s serpentine belt. But unlike your serpentine belt, which is easy to change, a timing belt is buried behind the timing belt cover, and it?s a labor-intensive process to reach.Making matters worse, you should replace your timing belt every 100,000 miles. And while that might sound like a lot, when you factor in that the average cost to replace your timing belt can exceed $900, it can be an expensive repair that you don?t want to deal with.But if you ignore the replacement and the timing belt snaps, you can end up totaling your engine which can cost you thousands of dollars instead.The reason that some vehicles use timing belts instead of timing chains primarily comes down to the price. While timing chains are far more reliable, timing belts are far cheaper. This allows the manufacturer to save some money during production.Furthermore, timing belts used to be far quieter than timing chains, but this isn?t the case anymore in newer vehicles.ProsMore affordable upfrontSometimes quitter than timing beltsConsThey don?t last as long, and you need to replace them"
Can I Switch a Timing Belt for a Timing Chain?	"If you?re looking to upgrade your timing belt to a more durable timing chain that you don?t need to worry about, chances are you?re out of luck. That?s because there?s more to this swap than just changing a belt for a chain, and it?s not something you?re going to figure out for yourself.However, if you?re lucky, there are a few timing chain conversion kits out there. You?ll have to check for your specific vehicle?s engine, but the chances are you?re out of luck.Keep this in mind when you?re purchasing a vehicle because if you get a timing belt, that?s what you?re probably going to be stuck with it for the long haul."
Which is Better: Timing Belt vs. Timing Chain?	"If you don?t choose a car engine model with many failed timing chain reports, a timing chain is much better than a timing belt. While a timing chain might be far more expensive to replace, the odds are that you?ll never have to replace it.Conversely, if your vehicle has a timing belt, chances are you?ll end up replacing it two to three times over the vehicle?s lifespan.This adds up, and if you replace the timing belt three times, the total cost can exceed $2,100! Moreover, since timing chains are now just as quiet as timing belts, there really is no reason to stick with a timing belt in a modern vehicle.But no matter what choice you go with, make sure that you?re keeping up with all of your service intervals to keep your vehicle running the way it should.Remember that many modern car models have problems with the timing chains, which can cause you to have to replace the timing chain. This is often more costly than a timing belt replacement. Therefore you need to check for the amount of timing chain failure reports of the specific engine model before buying your car."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Fuel Pump Relay ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad fuel pump relay are a stalling engine, performance issues, and a check engine light on your dashboard. If your car won?t start at all and you can?t hear the fuel pump when you turn on the ignition, it could also be due to a bad fuel pump relay.The relay can fail for many reasons, from dust to electrical power surges; anything can affect the well-being of a fuel pump relay.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing fuel pump relay to look for:1. Check Engine Light onCheck Engine LightThe engine control module monitors all engine sensors to ensure they do not show the wrong values. If the ECU suspects any sensor is giving an incorrect value, it will light up the check engine light. A check engine light is also the most common sign of a bad fuel pump relay.The ECU monitors the fuel pressure with the help of the fuel pressure sensor. If the fuel pump relay suddenly fails, it will light up the check engine light and store a trouble code relating to the fuel pressure.2. Rough AccelerationSlow AccelerationThe fuel pump relay going bad can affect the fuel pump?s power and affect fuel delivery to the engine. An engine runs on fuel just like the heart of a human runs on oxygen and blood.Therefore, any fuel pump relay issues will affect fuel flow to the combustion chamber, and your vehicle might have problems starting.However, this can happen due to several other reasons, such as a choked fuel filter, so you should always properly diagnose your car before replacing any parts.3. Engine StallingEngine StallIf the fuel pump relay has any bad solderings inside it, it might suddenly lose the relay connection and stop delivering power to the fuel pump.The engine turns off if the combustion chamber?s fuel is inadequate or doesn?t have the proper pressure.The part that ensures none of this happens is the fuel pump, and it cannot work perfectly if the fuel pump relay develops any issues.4. Engine is completely deadDead Car After RoadA faulty fuel pump relay can also cause the engine not to start at all and be completely dead. No fuel pressure means that your engine will never start, and if the fuel pump relay has failed, it will not give any power to the fuel pump to build up fuel pressure.5. No noise from fuel pump on ignitionStarting CarWhen you turn the ignition on in the ignition lock, you should hear a whirring noise from the rear of the car. This means that the fuel pump started building fuel pressure in the fuel rail.If you can?t hear this, there might be a problem with the fuel pump relay. You can try to listen closer to the fuel tank for any noise for 2-3 seconds after turning the ignition on."
Where is the Fuel Pump Relay Located?	"In most car models, the fuel pump relay is located in a fuse box somewhere under your dashboard, but it can also be located in the fuse box in the engine bay.The engine or dashboard fuse box is usually a long black box containing a fuel pump relay and various other fuses and relays. For different vehicles, the fuel pump relays can be located in different places.Check your repair manual to get the exact location of the fuel pump relay fast."
what is the Fuel Pump Relay Replacement Cost ?	"The average fuel pump replacement cost is between $90 and $150, depending on the car model and labor costs. The parts may cost you between $20 and $50, while the remaining cost is labor.The fuel pump relay is a small electronic device easily acquired online or at the nearest spare parts shop. The fuel pump relay?s replacement cost involves the cost of the parts and the labor cost that the mechanic would charge you.When considering the labor cost, it could be at least an hour of work or more in certain cases.The amount the repair shop charges you will depend on your mechanic?s hourly pay rate or the per-hour cost. Other than the labor cost, the fuel pump relay is not a very expensive device, and you can buy one for $20 to $50 on average for most vehicles."
what is the  Diagnosis Fuel Pump Relay ?	"Diagnosing a relay is often pretty straightforward. The fuel pump relay often has 4 pins, and in this case, diagnosing is usually easy. If your relay has more pins and not the same numbers mentioned here, you need to check a wiring diagram.Locate the fuse box and locate the fuel pump relayLift it and check under it for the numbers 30, 85, 86, and 87. If you locate these numbers, you can put the fuel pump relay back.Put the relay back so you can reach the pins with a multimeter while you cycle the ignition.Turn on the ignition and check pin 87 with a multimeter. If you get voltage there, it may tell you that the fuel pump relay is working, but it can also have intermittent problems.If you do not get voltage there, make sure that you have constant voltage on Pin 30 with the ignition on. If you don?t, there might be a problem with a broken fuse. You should also have constant voltage on pin 85, and pin 86 should be grounded from the engine control unit when you turn on the ignition.If you find any problems with the relay, you can remove the case from it to check for any bad soldering. Resolder the relay if you find any problems."
Can I run a fuel pump without a relay?	"You can, but it?s definitely not recommended. If you just want to test the fuel pump, you can bridge the relay to see if the relay is bad. But if you plan on driving around without the relay for a fuel pump and wiring it directly, that?s a bad idea. Fuel pumps require a lot of power, and if you install an on/off switch on the wire directly to the fuel pump, it will probably melt the switch."
Will a bad fuel pump relay throw a code?	"Yes. A bad fuel pump relay can throw a code, but that depends on the model of the car you drive and how advanced the on-board diagnostic system is. If the car throws a code on the fuel pump relay, the code will most likely be P0230, indicating that there is something wrong with the power to the fuel pump."
Can a bad fuel pump relay cause a car not to start?	"Yes. A bad fuel pump relay can cause a car not to start, and it?s actually quite a common cause. The fuel pump relay is responsible for supplying power to the fuel pump, and if it goes bad, the car will not be able to start."
Can I clean or fix a fuel pump relay?	"Yes. A relay can be cleaned and resoldered, but it requires some knowledge. You will need to take the relay apart and resolder it and clean all of the parts, then put it back together. Fuel pump relays are often quite cheap, so in most cases, it?s better just to buy a new relay."
Conclusion	"If your car has any of these bad fuel pump relay symptoms, it?s probably time to take it to a mechanic. Don?t wait until it?s too late and you?re stranded on the side of the road. Ignoring it can also cause other issues.If you feel you have the knowledge yourself, you can test the fuel pump relay with a multimeter to ensure it is working properly. If not, it could be due to cracked solder inside it!"

what are the Symptoms Exhaust Leak ?	"The main symptoms of an exhaust leak include:Higher engine sound than usualBlowing sound from underneath the carCheck engine lightLow Engine PerformanceUnusual OdorFailed emission testWhile these are not all possible signs, it?s a good start. If you suspect that your exhaust has started to leak fumes, take a look through the list below and see if you can diagnose the problem. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a leaking exhaust to look for:1. Higher Engine Sound Than UsualNoise From CarThe first symptom that you will notice when you have an exhaust leak is that your car will probably sound louder than usual.You will find one or two mufflers that are heavily reducing the engine sound on your exhaust pipe.If the exhaust leak occurs before one of these mufflers, the sound will not be silenced by the mufflers because it will flow out before them. This will cause a higher engine sound, depending on how large the exhaust leak is.2. Blowing sound from underneathCar Exhaust SoundIf the exhaust leak is just a small hole, it can sometimes create a blowing sound when you rev the engine. Depending on the size of the whole it can create different sounds, and in some cases, it can even cause high pitch whistling noises.If you can hear a ?blowing? sound from underneath your car and it wasnt there before, you most likely have an exhaust leak.3. Check Engine lightCheck Engine Light Reset ItselfModern cars have sensors on the exhaust system to measure the fuel mixture escaping from the engine. One of these sensors also measures the efficiency of the catalytic converter. These sensors are called O2 or Oxygen Sensors.If you have an exhaust leak before one of these sensors, it will cause them to measure faulty values, and the engine control unit will recognize this. This will cause the check engine light to appear on your dashboard.4. Low Engine PerformanceSlow AccelerationThe same thing applies here as with the check engine light. When there is an exhaust leak before one of these sensors on the exhaust pipe, they will get wrong values, and they will send false information to the engine control unit.The engine control unit will then use this information to calculate the air-fuel mixture of the next cycle in the car engine, and because the values are wron, it will cause an even stranger air-fuel mixture. This can cause rough idle, slow acceleration, rough acceleration, and misfires.If you hear a louder noise than usual from the engine and notice that the engine performance has dropped, it is definitely time to look for an exhaust leak.5. Unusual OdorBad Car Smell E1609777166642Another clear indicator that your exhaust has developed a leak is if you can smell exhaust fumes when the engine is running.As stated at the outset, your exhaust system has been designed to prevent this from happening. So, if you begin to notice a strange smell, something on the exhaust has failed and can no longer contain the fumes. Prolonged exposure to exhaust fumes can be incredibly harmful to humans. If you do begin to notice the smell of exhaust fumes, then try and get the leak fixed as soon as possible. 6. Failed emission testCar Emission TestIn some states and countries globally, you have to do a yearly emission test to pass the inspection. If you have an exhaust leak anywhere on the exhaust system, it will affect the emission test.If the leak is before the O2 sensors, it will mess with the air-fuel mixture, and if the leak is after the O2 sensors, the emission test will show a too lean mixture, and you will fail the test, depending on the size of the exhaust leak."
How To Find An Exhaust Leak ?	"Finding an exhaust leak can be challenging as the leak may be in a location that is difficult to access. Here are some steps you can follow to find an exhaust leak:Listen for Noise: One of the easiest ways to identify an exhaust leak is by listening for any unusual noise coming from the exhaust system. Turn off the radio and roll down the windows, then start the engine and listen for a hissing sound or any other unusual noise coming from the exhaust system.Look for Smoke: Another way to identify an exhaust leak is by looking for smoke coming from the exhaust system. White smoke or a sooty residue around the leak area can indicate an exhaust leak.Check for Rust: Exhaust leaks can also be caused by rust or corrosion on the exhaust system. Inspect the exhaust system for any signs of rust or corrosion, which can create holes in the exhaust system.Perform a Visual Inspection: Inspect the entire exhaust system, including the pipes, muffler, and catalytic converter, for any signs of damage or holes. Look for any cracks or holes in the pipes, welds, or connections.Feel for Air Flow: Feel around the exhaust system for any air flow. Use your hand to feel around the exhaust pipes, muffler, and other components for any air flow that should not be there.Use a Smoke Test: A smoke test can help identify small exhaust leaks that are difficult to see or hear. A smoke machine is used to pump smoke into the exhaust system, and any leaks will cause the smoke to escape, making it easier to locate the leak.It's important to fix any exhaust leaks as soon as possible, as they can lead to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and even carbon monoxide poisoning. If you're not comfortable finding and fixing an exhaust leak yourself, consider taking your vehicle to a mechanic or exhaust specialist for repairs."
Is it Safe to Drive with an Exhaust Leak? 	"I do not recommend driving around with an exhaust leak, because it is harmful to both you and the environment. There is also a risk that your car will catch on fire if you are unlucky.The safety of the vehicle will depend greatly on what?s causing your exhaust leak. As already stated, exhaust fumes can be harmful if you?re exposed to them for a prolonged period of time. Exhaust fumes are very hot, and sometimes the fuel in the exhaust pipe gets ignited. If you are unlucky and the exhaust leak is in the wrong place, it can cause your car to catch fire.If you?re not sure, have your exhaust inspected by a professional, as this can usually be carried out either free of charge or at very little cost."
what is the Exhaust Leak Repair Cost ?	"The average exhaust leak repair cost is usually between $100 and $800, heavily depending on where the exhaust leak is.Here are the average repair costs for exhaust leak repairs. These prices are including part and labor costs. This can heavily depend on your car model.Part Replacement	Replacement CostCatback Exhaust Replacement	$150 to $600Exhaust Joint Replacement	$30 to $200Exhaust Pipe Welding	$20 to $100Catalytic Converter Replacement	$400 to $1500Exhaust braided flex pipe	$100 to $300Whole Exhaust Pipe Replacement	$300 to $1200Front Exhaust pipe replacement	$150 to $600Sometimes you can be lucky, and the exhaust leak can be fixed with a welder. This can solve your exhaust leak problem for free if you know how to do it yourself.Exhaust systems can often be replaced in sections without having to replace the entire system. This saves a lot of costs.Catalytic converters and DPF?s are often on the more expensive side of the scale, so if you can fix your leak without replacing these, that?s always a bonus."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Knock Sensor ?	"The most common symptom of a bad knock sensor is a check engine light on your dashboard. It can also result in a knocking or detonating engine in the worst case, but most often you will notice signs like loss of engine power and high fuel consumption.Below we have a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing knock sensor to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightJust because you have a check engine light for your knock sensor doesn?t mean that there?s anything wrong with the sensor, but there could be! Another possibility is that your vehicle has an engine knock.Either way, you?ll get a check engine light, so you?ll have to narrow down the problem a bit further after you read the engine code.2. Knocking engineKnocking EngineEven if your engine control module will, in most cases, do just fine without the knock sensor, it can lead to engine knocking or pinging in rare cases.Engine knocking or pinging is fatal to your engine, and it can cause serious damage to it within seconds. This is definitely something you want to avoid.3. Decreased AccelerationSlow Car AccelerationAs soon as your knock sensor gives you, you?re going to notice a decrease in acceleration. This occurs as your engine defaults to reduced outputs to prevent any potential engine damage.Not only does it decrease the likelihood of further damage, but it also reduces overall emissions to stay compliant with EPA standards.4. Loss of Engine PowerSlow Acceleration CarIf your vehicle has a faulty knock sensor, it won?t only affect how quickly it can accelerate, but it?ll also lose its top speed and torque. That?s because those default values that your engine reverts to reduce your engine?s performance to keep your engine from producing too much and force and causing further damage.But by reducing the amount of force, your engine?s computer also reduces the amount of power that the engine can produce.5. Loss of Fuel EconomyRefuel CarAnytime that your engine reverts to default values, you?re not getting an optimized performance. Not only does that affect power and acceleration, but it also affects fuel economy.This fuel economy reduction isn?t likely to be super noticeable, but you?ll probably see a drop by a few miles per gallon."
where the Knock Sensor Function ?	"The purpose of the knock sensor is to check for abnormal noises coming from the combustion chamber. These strange noises are known as knocks and indicate a deeper problem in your system that you need to troubleshoot.If the knock sensor does detect a problem, it illuminates the check engine light and reduces overall engine performance to protect your vehicle. While this is a useful feature to protect your engine when something goes wrong, it can also make it a bit frustrating to troubleshoot a faulty knock sensor.You?ll notice the exact same symptoms if you have a faulty knock sensor that you would detect if you actually had a knock in your engine!That?s why you need to rule out a potential engine knock before determining that you have a faulty knock sensor. Otherwise, you might be replacing a sensor that?s doing exactly what it?s supposed to!Keep in mind that not all knocks are loud, so if you don?t know what you?re looking for, it?s best to have a certified mechanic take a look at it and make a diagnosis."
how to test Knock Sensor ?	"The knock sensor is a critical component of a vehicle's engine management system. Its primary function is to detect engine knock, which is the sound produced when the air/fuel mixture detonates prematurely in the engine's combustion chamber. If the knock sensor is not functioning properly, it can lead to engine damage and reduced performance. Here's how you can test a knock sensor:Check the Check Engine Light: If the knock sensor is not functioning properly, it will likely trigger the check engine light on the dashboard. Check for any codes related to the knock sensor using an OBD-II scanner.Inspect the Wiring: Check the wiring and connections for any damage, corrosion, or loose connections. A damaged or corroded wiring may lead to a malfunctioning knock sensor.Check the Resistance: Using a multimeter, measure the resistance across the terminals of the knock sensor. The resistance should fall within the manufacturer's specified range. If the resistance is outside the range, the knock sensor may be faulty.Check for Signal Output: With the engine running, use a voltmeter to check the signal output from the knock sensor. A properly functioning knock sensor should produce a fluctuating voltage signal in response to engine knock. If there is no signal or a constant signal, the knock sensor may be faulty.Perform a Tap Test: Using a tool such as a screwdriver handle or rubber mallet, gently tap the engine block near the knock sensor while the engine is running. The tap test may cause the engine to knock, which should trigger a response from the knock sensor. If there is no response, the knock sensor may be faulty.It's important to note that knock sensor testing can be complicated and may require specialized equipment and knowledge. If you're not comfortable testing the knock sensor yourself, consider taking your vehicle to a mechanic or engine specialist for testing."
where the Knock Sensor Location ?	"There are a few different possible locations for the knock sensor, but the most common places include the engine block, the cylinder head, or the intake manifold. The most common is that it is bolted to the engine block. Keep in mind that your knock sensor needs to hear and feel what?s going on.Because of the wide variance in a knock sensor?s locations, it?s best to have an idea of what you?re looking for before you start. A good way to do this is to look up your vehicle?s specific knock sensor on a parts site before trying to track yours down.Finally, keep in mind that these are electrical connectors, so you?ll be able to tell if you?re looking in the right area if there?s an electrical connector sticking out of the back of the sensor. However, there are tons of different sensors, so make sure you?re disconnecting the right one.If you?re not sure if you?ve found the right sensor, consider taking your vehicle to a certified mechanic for repairs so you don?t accidentally cause further damage."
Knock Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"The average knock sensor replacement cost is between $250 and $350, depending on your vehicle and the specific repair shop you take it to. But keep in mind that this is if the knock sensor is faulty, and not if you have an engine knock.Before you replace any components, make sure that you have a proper diagnosis. That way, you?re not throwing money down the drain for replacing the wrong parts.You can save a few bucks by completing the repairs yourself. An aftermarket knock sensor costs anywhere from $20 to $100, depending on what you drive. But keep in mind that OEM parts will cost more, and you need OEM parts if your vehicle is still under warranty.However, if a mechanic is going to be completing the repairs, standard labor costs for a knock sensor replacement range from $150 to $250. That?s because depending on what you drive, the knock sensor can be challenging to access without removing other components. The more components your mechanic has to remove or work around, the more you can expect to pay.Unfortunately, that also makes it more likely that you need to hire a certified mechanic in the first place. But if you can do the job yourself, you can normally save a few hundred dollars."
what are the Symptoms Seized Engine ?	"1. Engine Doesn?t StartStart EngineWhen the engine seizes, the car might not start. You should still be able to turn the car on and run the electronics, such as the heater fan, lights, and radio.However, cranking the engine will produce no action. If anything, you will hear a clunking sound when the starter impacts the flywheel. 2. Physical DefectSometimes the engine seizes because an internal part becomes loose and lodges itself into another component. If this is something such as a piston connecting rod, it could penetrate through the engine block. An inspection of the engine block would reveal the problem because the parts can come through the top in severe cases. 3. Burnt WiresThe seized engine itself doesn?t create burnt wires; it?s what happens after the engine fails. As the starter attempts to crank the engine, additional problems occur.The starter isn?t able to turn the engine, so the wires start overheating. You will notice smoking and a burning smell, which is a common occurrence after a seized engine happens. 4. Engine NoisesShortly before the engine seizes, you might notice some strange engine noises. Sometimes these noises appear as a light tapping, or it can be a faint knocking. Either way, the engine is about to fail completely once you hear the death knock. This sound often accompanies a piston connecting rod hitting the crankshaft. "
What Does A Seized Engine Mean?	"A seized engine means it?s stuck, and it won?t rotate when you try to start it. The electronics in your car may work, but nothing will happen when you turn the key. A seized engine is often caused by serious engine damage, which is often very costly to repair."
what are the Causes Seized Engine ?	"The most common cause of a seized engine is that it has been running with a lack of engine oil in the oil pan. It can also be caused by water in the cylinders or a broken crankshaft rod or piston. In many cases, it can also be the result of driving with an overheated engine.These are just some of the possible causes; here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of a seized engine:1. Lack of Engine OilCheck Engine Oil LevelYour car engine needs oil to maintain proper lubrication of the moving parts. The oil also provides some cooling to the engine components. When the engine oil gets too low, the engine begins to heat up, and parts start rubbing together. A lot of friction starts to occur as the internal components dry out. The engine can only run like this for so long and will eventually seize.2. Water in the EngineWater isn?t meant to be in the car engine, but sometimes it finds a way in. If you drive through a large puddle, water can make its way into the intake. Other times, water can infiltrate the fuel tank. Because it doesn?t compress like the air/fuel mixture, it causes damage to the connecting rods inside the engine. Once the connecting rods bend, the engine seizes. This situation is otherwise known as hydrolock. 3. Rusty ComponentsOver time, metal is prone to rusting. As the vehicle gets old, the chances of rusty parts become higher. While internal engine parts don?t generally get rusted with proper lubrication, if water gets inside, it could happen. Once parts are rusted, the components grind together, creating metal shavings that could interfere with operation. 4. Broken ComponentsRust isn?t the only thing that can happen to the moving parts. It?s also possible for components to break. This problem occurs with the valves, connecting rods, or pistons. If these parts break off, they get stuck somewhere in the engine where they don?t belong. This is the cumulative effect, where one defect leads to another. 5. Overheated EngineThe engine should never be allowed to overheat, or you are looking at serious problems. First, overheating engines lead to expanding pistons, which can damage the cylinder walls.Aside from this, you can also blow a head gasket when the engine overheats, which is another expensive repair. 6. Locked StarterWhile a locked starter isn?t going to cause a seized engine, the symptoms are closely related. The two can feel the same. When the starter seizes with the solenoid stuck, it grabs the flywheel. Thankfully, this repair is much more manageable than a seized engine. 7. Timing Belt/Camshaft FailureIf the timing chain, belt, or camshaft fails, it can cause the valves to hit the pistons. As we?ve already discussed, trouble with the pistons causes the engine to seize. "
How to Fix a Seized Engine ?	"Fixing a seized engine starts with determining what the problem is. Many times, the symptoms of a bad starter are quite similar, so you want a proper diagnosis first.By manually rotating the crankshaft, you rule out the starter. However, if it doesn?t rotate, you want to remove the starter and try again. Remove the serpentine belt and try to rotate it again to make sure it is not seized because of a bad alternator or AC compressor.If you have the knowledge, you should also inspect the timing belt or timing chain timing.Once you determine that the engine is seized, you don?t have a lot of options for repair. Most of the time, it makes the most sense to replace the engine. Without seeing inside the engine, it?s difficult to know how much damage has been done. Sure, there are some internal components that could be repaired with the help of a machine shop, but this can become more expensive than replacing the motor. However, high-performance or rare motors might be better fixed instead of replaced. If the engine is seized up because it spent too much time in the elements, you might be able to salvage the engine because there aren?t internal defects. A qualified mechanic can help you determine the right course of action. "
Can a Seized Engine be Rebuilt?	"There?s always the option to rebuild a car engine, but labor costs can become astronomical depending on what the problem is. Before getting an estimate, the mechanic will have to pull the engine apart to look for irreparable damage. If the mechanic sees a rod through the engine block, it spells trouble.Additionally, if the engine has overheated, it might have warped internal components, thereby degrading its durability. In most cases, it just makes sense to replace the engine. "
what the Seized Engine Fix Costs ?	"The seized engine repair costs are going to quickly exceed $3,000 whether you choose to replace it or rebuild it. If you have an older vehicle, this expense won?t make sense, which is why many vehicles with a seized engine end up in the junkyard."
Can I fix an engine that is seized?	"Yes. Seized engines can be fixed, but it is not an easy task, and it can require a lot of money. How expensive it will be, depends on what caused the engine to seize up in the first place. If the engine is stuck due to a broken timing chain or belt, you may need to rebuild the entire engine, which can cost over $5,000."
How do I free up a seized engine?	"If your engine has seized because it hasn?t been used for a long time, try filling the cylinders with oil for a couple of hours and then try again. However, if the engine is seized due to damage, the engine needs to be repaired and sometimes even replaced."
How much is my car worth with a seized engine?	"A car with a seized engine would likely need a new engine, and that could cost more than the car is worth. So, to figure out how much your car will be worth with a seized engine, you need to figure out how much it will cost to repair or replace the engine. You can expect to get significantly less for your car if it has a seized engine."
Can I trade in a car with a seized engine?	"Technically speaking, you can trade in a car with a seized engine. However, most dealerships and private sellers will not accept such a vehicle. For this reason, it?s usually best to sell or scrap a car with a seized engine."
What Causes a Car Engine to Stall While Idling?	"A car can stall while idling due to a defective oxygen or mass airflow sensor. It can also be caused by an EGR valve that?s stuck open, or fouled spark plugs. Additionally, the idle air control valve, throttle body, fuel system or transmission could be to blame. Here is some more detailed information about the reasons why your car engine is stalling while idling:1. Defective Oxygen or Mass Airflow SensorMass Air Flow SensorThe vehicle has several sensors working to ensure that the air-fuel mixture of the engine is just right. All of the sensors are responsible for sending information to the ECM (engine control module). With this information, the ECM determines how to regulate the engine for proper operation.The oxygen sensor is found in the exhaust manifold. It measures how much air is leaving the engine. The mass airflow sensor sits alongside the engine within the intake air duct to measure how much air is entering the combustion chamber. The ECM uses this data to lower or raise the amount of air needed in the combustion chamber. If the information coming from either sensor is incorrect, the ECM will send in the wrong amount of air, causing trouble while idling. 2. Stuck Open EGR ValveEgr Valve LocationThe Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) helps to take a portion of the exhaust and send it back into the combustion chamber. This process helps to decrease the internal temperature. Carbon dioxide doesn?t burn like oxygen does, so it helps to reduce the temperature in the engine. If the EGR valve gets stuck open, the exhaust gas won?t stop flowing. The air-fuel ratio becomes imbalanced because of the excess amount of exhaust flowing through. This defect can also cause the system to suck in more air. Without the right amount of power, the engine is going to stall. 3. Fouled Spark PlugsSooty Spark PlugThe spark plugs have to ignite the air and fuel mixture that?s in the combustion chamber. As the plugs age, carbon deposits build up on the tip, making them less effective at starting this ignition process. This defect leads to less power within the engine, creating a stalling effect while idling. Changing the spark plugs is considered a regular maintenance task and is part of the regular tune-up. Copper plugs might only last up to 30,000 miles, but you can find iridium or platinum plugs that will run for 100,000 miles. RELATED: 6 Symptoms of Bad Spark Plugs (& Replacement Cost)4. Throttle BodyInstall Throttle BodyIf you have a car made before the mid-2000s, it probably contains a mechanical throttle body. When these become dirty or contaminated, airflow can be inhibited. This can lead to a stalling engine.Cars made after this date contain an electronic throttle body. If there?s a problem with the circuitry or connections, a defective throttle body can cause the engine to stall. It could also be due to a dirty throttle body. Look further down in the article for more details.5. Malfunctioning Idle Air Control ValveThe idle air control valve or actuator keeps the RPMs in the appropriate range, especially when idling. It takes the information from the ECM to determine the proper RPMs. If the actuator or valve is defective, the speed of the engine might become too low. Once it gets too low, the engine is going to stall. If your car has an electric throttle body, the idle air control valve is most likely integrated with it.6. Fuel System IssuesWe have discussed the need for the proper amount of air in the combustion chamber, but it?s equally important that there?s the right amount of fuel. If there?s a lack of fuel getting to the engine, the car could stall. There are multiple fuel system components that could be to blame. You might be dealing with a defective fuel pump or a clogged fuel filter. Fuel system issues also cause other symptoms that might be noticeable before it gets to this point. You may hear whining noises, feel sputtering, notice surging and have trouble starting the car. As your car?s performance gets worse, the efficiency of the engine decreases, causing you to spend more time at the gas pump as well. 7. Transmission TroubleNo one wants to hear that the transmission could be a problem because it just sounds like an expensive repair. However, it?s true that the transmission can cause issues with idling. The problem here would come from the torque converter. In automatic transmissions, the torque converter acts as a clutch from a manual transmission. The torque converter delivers power from the motor to the drivetrain. If it becomes damaged or wears out, the torque converter becomes locked up. With this resistance, the motor stalls. There?s also the chance that it is just the solenoid. This electromagnet part is responsible for measuring and regulating the fluid pressure. "
Diagnosing an Idling Engine	"If you want to determine the problem yourself, you can follow these simple steps.Scan diagnostic trouble codes. Use your OBDII code scanner to see if any faults have registered. Research the faults and repair the issue to remove the trouble codes.Spray some starting fluid on the throttle body. If the vehicle runs normally during this time, you are looking at a fuel system issue. Check the fuel pressure. Insert a fuel pressure gauge in the pressure side of the fuel delivery system. With a gas engine, you should see 40 to 50 PSI, while the diesel engine often has pressures that are higher. You can find the appropriate reading in your vehicle?s service manual. Check for spark. Put an inline spark tester between a good ground and the plug boot. Crank the engine. If you see the tester light up, the engine is receiving a spark. Otherwise, you need to take a look at the spark plugs. Clean the throttle body and do a calibration with your OBD2 scanner, if it got this function. You may need to go to your dealer to calibrate the throttle body.If these steps don?t help you find out what?s wrong, you might need a professional to take a second look."
what is the Cost to Fix Stalling Engine ?	"The cost of fixing a stalling engine depends on what needs to be repaired. If you must put in a new oxygen sensor, you might spend between $150 and $500 for parts and labor. If you replace the mass airflow sensor, expect to spend about $200 to $350 in total. If you need to replace the EGR valve, it could cost $250 to $400. While you may be able to clean the EGR valve for about $150 to $200, it may not solve the issue and a replacement will be needed anyway. The cost to replace the spark plugs depends on what type you choose. You might spend $50 to $250 for a complete tune-up. If you invest in iridium or platinum spark plugs, you will be able to go longer between tune-ups, even up to 100,000 miles. It?s possible that you can clean the throttle body and resolve the issue. This repair only requires the use of throttle body cleaner to fix the issue. If there?s a circuitry issue, you may need a new throttle body, which could cost $200 to $650. If you need to replace the air control valve, you could spend $100 to $500. Among fuel system issues, you may need to replace a fuel pump, which costs $200 to $1,000, while a fuel filter would only be about $50 to $200. Of course, some of the most expensive issues are part of the transmission. Replacing the torque converter could cost $600 to $1,000. However, if it?s just the solenoid that needs replacement, you could spend $15 to $100. Plus, this job is easy enough to perform yourself, so there?s no reason to pay for any labor."
What is a fuel induction service?	"A Fuel Induction Service is a type of service and maintenance procedure for your car?s engine. It?s a process of cleaning the electronic throttle body, air intake valves, and fuel injectors, which you can find in electronically fuel-injected vehicles and newer vehicles.The throttle body and the plate are manually cleaned by the mechanic or technician using a particular throttle cleaning substance.Here are the benefits of getting the fuel induction service:Improves your car?s gas mileageSmooths your engine?s idleImproves the throttle responseWould I recommend doing a fuel injection service at a mechanic workshop? Not directly if it is not necessary.If you have a direct-injected engine that is running rough or has misfires because of leaking intake valves, I would recommend it, but not otherwise.You can do most parts of the fuel induction service yourself at home with the help of some products. You will find these steps further down in the article."
Why is a fuel induction service performed?	"A fuel induction service is performed to clean the throttle body, intake valve, intake manifold, and other intake related parts that affect the air-fuel mixture.When your car gets older, it will start to collect old carbon deposits everywhere on the engine?s intake side. This is caused by carbon entering from the crankcase ventilation and the EGR valve. It can also come from oil slipping through the turbo.This especially happens on direct-injected fuel engines, which spray the fuel directly into the combustion chamber. Older engines sprayed the fuel before the intake valves, which cleaned them and did not cause problems like this as often.These carbon deposits will build on the valve body, intake pipes, intake manifold, and intake valves. This is exactly why a fuel induction is performed ? to clean these parts from carbon deposits.This will affect the air-fuel mixture and the intake valves? seals, which will result in a much smoother engine."
Pros of a fuel induction service	Cleans the throttle bodyCleans the intake manifoldCleans the intake valvesCleans other flaps inside the intake manifold if fitted
Signs Your Car Needs A Fuel Induction Service	"You know now what the fuel induction service does for your engine, but the question arises: should you get the service done frequently?While the fuel induction service does benefit your car, this should not be done regularly. Fuel induction is only called for if you encounter problems individually as a result of carbon building up.The signs that you need to do a fuel induction service include:Your car isn?t able to idle smoothlyYou feel the vibration as you give gasYou feel a delay in the engine?s pick up as you press on the gas pedalYou experience an extremely low gas mileageThe car doesn?t start as quickly as it used toOnly if you begin to experience these factors should you think about getting a fuel induction service."
What does this service include and how is it performed?	"These would be the steps included in a fuel inductor service if a mechanic workshop were to do it. As you can see, much of this is stuff you can actually do yourself at home.1. Intake valve cleaningThis step is done by spraying a special liquid into the intake valves while the engine is running. This feeds the engine with throttle cleaner fluid and the air, which gets into the mixture and is ignited. This cleans the carbon deposits inside the intake and the intake valves.The compound breaks up the deposits inside, and the remains are let out via the exhaust.A similar variant of this step can be made by yourself at home with the help of seafoam.2. Throttle body cleaningThis is an optional service for a fuel induction, depending on the workshop. Sometimes the throttle body is just cleaned by the injector cleaner entering the engine.But if a throttle body cleaning is performed, the mechanic or technician would first remove the throttle body from the engine. A particular compound called the throttle cleaner is used to clean the carbon. This is a liquid substance and comes in spray cans.If you want to do this yourself, you can check out our guide: How to clean a throttle body.3. Fuel Injector CleaningThis is also an additional service that your mechanic sometimes offers when you are doing a fuel induction service. This includes filling a special additive into the fuel tank, which will clean the fuel pump and fuel injectors.There are special injector cleaner additives that do this job for you, and it is something you can do yourself just by buying one of these. If you want to perform this step by yourself, I can recommend this one from Amazon."
Is a fuel induction service necessary?	"If you have an older car that runs a little rough and it?s been a while since the throttle body and fuel system were cleaned, a fuel induction service can help. However, if your car is only a few years old with low mileage, it probably isn?t necessary."
Can I do a fuel induction service yourself?	"Yes. You can at least do some of the steps in a fuel induction service yourself with some basic knowledge and tools. Cleaning the throttle body and fuel injectors can be done with some basic research. However, to clean the valves and the inside of the intake manifold, you may need special tools depending on the car model."
What is the difference between fuel injection service and fuel induction service?	"When you do a fuel injection service, you only clean the parts where fuel flows, such as the fuel rail, fuel injector and fuel pressure regulator. When you do a fuel induction service, you also clean the areas where the engine?s airflow is, such as the intake manifold, intake valves, and throttle body."
How often should you get a fuel induction service?	"A fuel induction service does not need to be done very often. To keep your car in top shape, you can have a fuel induction service done every 60,000 miles, or sooner if you notice performance problems due to clogged air or fuel system."
How to find a Vacuum Leak ?	"The easiest way to find a vacuum leak at home without using any tools is to carefully spray a flammable liquid around the areas where you suspect the leak may be coming from when the engine is idling. If the engine RPMs increase, you have found a vacuum leak.This method can be dangerous if you are not careful, as you can cause your car to catch fire! I always recommend using the right tools to find vacuum leaks. Do it at your own risk, and always do it outdoors. Keep a fire extinguisher nearby. (Note: Never spray near hot parts or ignition parts.) These steps should only be done by professionals!Go further down in the article to find more safe methods.Total Time: 5 minutes1. Visually Inspect Vacuum HosesCracked Vacuum HoseThe first step you should take before you go further into this guide is to check all the vacuum hoses for cracks, or even completely broken hoses. Vacuum hoses are made of rubber, which will become hard and start to crack after some years in the engine?s heat. Replace any faulty vacuum hoses you can find.2. Start the EngineHard StartingIf you couldn?t find any cracked or leaky vacuum hoses or other parts in the engine bay, it is now time to fire up the engine. Apply the parking brake, put the gearbox in Neutral or Park, and fire up the engine. Be careful not to touch any moving or hot parts during this guide!3. Get a Flammable Spray ReadyFlammable SprayTo continue this guide, you need a flammable fluid in spray or gas form. You can use starter spray, brake cleaner, carburetor cleaner, or propane gas from a propane torch, for example. I strongly recommend using a carburetor cleaner or propane torch for these steps.4. Carefully Spray Around Intake Manifold GasketSpray Manifold GasketTake the spray and try to locate where the intake manifold is connected to the cylinder head, and carefully spray around the connection here on each cylinder. If the car?s RPM changes or starts to sound weird, your car most likely has a bad intake manifold gasket. You can also try to spray around other suspected areas on the intake manifold, if it?s divided into several parts.5. Carefully Spray Around Vacuum HosesSpray Around Vacuum HosesLocate where all the vacuum hoses are connected on the intake manifold and spray around the connections of them. Even if they look good, there can be small cracks in them that are leaking. You can also follow the hoses and spray the other end of them. If the engine RPM gets higher or lower, you have definitely found a vacuum leak.6. Carefully Spray Around Brake Booster HoseBrake Booster HoseThe brake booster builds a vacuum with a one-way valve to make sure you do not have to press super hard on the brake pedal to brake. Spray around the connection to it and other areas around the brake booster to try locating any leaks. You have to be very carefully listening to the engine?s RPM here, though. The sound may be very hard to notice because you are spraying so far away from the engine.7. Carefully Spray Around Solenoids & ActuatorsIntake AxlesLook around the intake manifold and follow the vacuum hoses to find solenoids and actuators connected to the vacuum system. These solenoids and actuators are often made of plastic, which can crack with time. Spray around these, especially if they have axles attached to the intake manifold like in the picture above. Replace faulty actuators or solenoids if you find a leaky one.8. Carefully Spray Around Throttle BodyCar Intake Throttle BodyNow you have one last step to check, and it is the gasket between the throttle body and the intake manifold. Your throttle body is bolted with 3 or 4 screws into the intake manifold, or there is often a rubber or paper gasket between these two parts. Sometimes, this gasket goes bad and starts to leak. Spray around other areas around the throttle body also to check for leaks.Estimated Cost: 5 USD"
Other Methods to find Vacuum Leaks ?	"So if you think the guide above is a little bit too risky with flammable fluids, you can also use other methods. Here are three different methods you can use to find vacuum leaks!1. Visual and Listening ChecksIn some cases, locating vacuum leaks is straightforward ? just looking at the components in the engine bay might be enough. Check for any cracked or broken vacuum hoses or other signs that there is a leak. Often, there will be a little bit of oil around a leak, so look for signs of oils around the intake.Vacuum leaks often cause a high pitch sound on idle also, and you can usually locate the leak by just listening with your ears. Be careful not to touch any moving or hot parts while listening, though.2. Soap & WaterYou can also use soap and water to find leaks around the intake. However, this method is more effective when the air is pushed out and not sucked in like with a vacuum leak. With the soap?s help, you should be able to see where the leak is coming from. To be honest, I haven?t tried this method very much, and it is up to you if you want to do it.3. Use an EVAP smoke machineCar Smoke Machine TestThis is the method for professionals that want to find vacuum leaks super fast in a very safe way. The downside is that you need an EVAP smoke machine, which can often cost over 1000$, and it is probably not something you have in your garage.However, if you have the luck to borrow one from a repair workshop, you should definitely do it. If you own a workshop and do not have a smoke machine, it is strongly recommended. You will save a lot of time in troubleshooting."
What can I spray to check for vacuum leaks?	"You can spray any flammable fluid, but be careful with any materials that can damage the engine. I recommend only using carb cleaner, brake cleaner, propane gas, or starter spray."
Can I use Carb Cleaner to find a vacuum leak?	"Yes. Carburetor cleaner works really well for this job, and it is actually one of our recommended fluids to use to find vacuum leaks."
Can I use starting fluid to find a vacuum leak?	"Yes. You can use starter fluid to find a vacuum leak. However, in my opinion, it is a little bit too flammable for this job, and is a little bit dangerous. Brake cleaner or carb cleaner works better."
Can I use brake cleaner to find a vacuum leak?	"Yes. Using a brake cleaner works very well for the job of finding a vacuum leak. It depends slightly on different brake cleaner brands, but make sure that the brake cleaner is not too flammable or not flammable enough."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Engine Control Unit (ECU) ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad engine control unit are a stalling engine and a check engine light on the dashboard. You may also notice changes to fuel consumption and problems starting the car. You may also notice a decrease in engine performance.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing engine control unit (ECU) to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightThe most recognizable sign that something is wrong with the ECU is when the Check Engine Light comes on. However, this warning light will go off for myriad reasons, not necessarily just because of the ECU.Using an OBDII scanner should reveal if the problem is a defective engine control unit. If so, it might be caused by a defective circuit, sensor or another electronic component. Research the trouble codes to pinpoint the issue. 2. Engine StallsEngine StallIf the ECU is failing, you might notice trouble with your car?s idle. It could start misfiring or stalling when you are sitting at a traffic light. This pattern of stalling and misfiring might be completely random, with no pattern to use for troubleshooting. This problem is caused by a faulty ECU sending the wrong information to the engine, possibly causing too much fuel or air to enter into the ratio. 3. Poor Fuel EconomyBad Fuel ConsumptionWith an imbalanced air/fuel ratio, the engine won?t run optimally. The ECU could inadvertently send too much fuel to the combustion chamber, causing you to spend more time filling up at the gas station.That?s why it?s important to keep track of your fuel economy, so you can get a heads up when a problem exists. Plus, if the vehicle is burning through more fuel, you are also harming the environment. 4. Decrease in Engine PerformanceOn the other hand, the malfunctioning ECU might not send enough fuel to the combustion chamber. When this happens, you are going to notice some performance issues.You might step down on the gas pedal only to get no response. The vehicle might also vibrate, especially when trying to climb inclines, or if you are towing. It?s best to replace the ECU before your vehicle stops performing at all. 5. Car Doesn?t StartThe worst thing that could happen because of a failed ECU is to have a car that won?t start. You might notice it becomes more difficult to crank over until it eventually stops. While having a non-running car can mean many things, it?s also a symptom that the engine control unit has failed completely. Without any signals being sent to the engine, it simply doesn?t know what to do. "
where the Engine Control Unit Location ?	"The engine control unit is often found near or on the engine. In some vehicles, you can find it behind the glove compartment or underneath the dashboard. However, there?s not just one place where the ECU can be found. That?s why it?s essential to check the service manual if you need to find your car?s engine control unit. "
what is The Function of an Engine Control Unit (ECU) ?	"The engine control unit processes the information coming from various sensors around the vehicle and sends the data to the motor. Some of the information it processes includes engine spark and fuel-to-air ratios. It?s a critical component of any modern vehicle, where most of the essential functions are handled by the ECU. If the engine control unit starts to malfunction, any number of problems can occur, to the point where the car won?t work at all. "
what  is the Engine Control Unit Replacement Cost ?	"The average engine control unit replacement cost is between $500 and $2000 for most vehicles. You can expect to pay around $450 to $1800 for the ECU, with about $50 to $200 due in labor charges.While changing the ECU yourself can save you a small amount of money, the majority of the repair expense is the part itself.In some cases, it?s possible to reconfigure or reprogram the ECU. If that?s possible in your situation, you won?t need to purchase a new engine control unit but will simply have the labor expense. Additionally, you will have to pay to have the ECU diagnosed at your local shop. In some cases, this could cost $100 to $300. However, if you have an OBDII scanner and don?t mind doing a little online research, you might be able to diagnose the problem yourself. Economy cars will be the cheapest to repair. If you drive a luxury car with a complex electronic system, the ECU is going to cost you more. While it might be tempting to purchase a used ECU to cut down on the costs, this isn?t a good long-term option. Not only can it fail prematurely, but you will need to have it reprogrammed anyway. Some engine control units can only the manufacturer reprogram for you, and if this is the case, it is very difficult to reprogram it. You need to ask your dealer before you try to switch it."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Glow Plug ?	"The most common symptom of a bad diesel glow plug is difficulty starting the car engine when it?s cold. You may also notice slow acceleration and a misfiring engine. These symptoms will often show together with a check engine light on your dashboard.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of bad or failing glow plugs to look for:1. Trouble Starting the VehicleStart EngineIf your diesel engine has bad glow plugs, it can become difficult to start it. The faulty plugs don?t generate enough heat to warm up the cylinders.If the plugs don?t create enough heat quickly, it might take several tries to get the motor going. Additionally, if the glow plugs are nearly dead and the temperatures are extremely low, you might not be able to start the engine at all. 2. Poor AccelerationSlow AccelerationSometimes, the bad glow plugs can affect the performance of the engine, especially in colder weather. If you are pushing the accelerator down and nothing seems to be happening, you may need to replace the glow plugs.However, poor acceleration is a common occurrence for many defective parts. You would need to do a more in-depth investigation before concluding the glow plugs were to blame. 3. Engine MisfiringA backfiring engine occurs when the fuel doesn?t ignite correctly in the cylinder. Any type of misfire is a cause for alarm, but when it is caused by a bad glow plug, it is easy to fix.The glow plug needs to warm up the cylinder properly so it can ignite the fuel. While misfiring can be caused by other issues, a defective glow plug is a good place to look first. 4. Black Exhaust SmokeIf your diesel vehicle is pouring out black or dark gray smoke from the exhaust, there is a problem. These colors signify that something is wrong with the combustion system.However, the diesel engine can also produce black smoke for other reasons. You will want to check the glow plugs if smoke is coming from the exhaust and you are noticing other symptoms from our list. 5. Check Engine Light or Glow plug lightWhen glow plugs become faulty, the Check Engine Light can be triggered. You can scan the system with your OBDII diagnostic tool to get the error codes. In some cases, you will see the P0380 ?Glow Plug/Heater Circuit A Malfunction. However, it can also trigger P0670, P0671, P0672, P0673, P0674, P0675, P0676, P0677, P0678, P0679, P0680, P0681, P0682, P0683, and P0684, P0381, P0382, P0383 and P0384."
where the  Diesel Glow Plug Location ?	"The diesel glow plugs are located in the cylinder head of the engine. They are screwed into each cylinder individually. All glow plugs are powered with 12 volts coming from the battery.You can locate them because they will have the top sticking out connected to a wire that delivers the power. In some cases, you may need to remove the valve cover to get to the glow plugs. "
how to test Glow Plug ?	"Glow plugs are used in diesel engines to help heat the air in the combustion chamber during cold weather, making it easier for the engine to start. Testing a glow plug is a simple process that can be done with a few basic tools.Here are the steps to test a glow plug:Remove the glow plug: Locate the glow plug on the engine and use a socket wrench to remove it from the engine.Inspect the glow plug: Check the tip of the glow plug for any damage or excessive wear. If the glow plug looks damaged or worn, it should be replaced.Check for continuity: Use a multimeter to check the continuity of the glow plug. Set the multimeter to the ohms setting and touch one probe to the tip of the glow plug and the other probe to the metal housing. If the multimeter shows a reading between 0.5 and 2 ohms, the glow plug is functioning properly. If there is no reading, the glow plug is faulty and needs to be replaced.Test the voltage: With the glow plug removed from the engine, connect a test wire to the glow plug and connect the other end of the wire to the positive battery terminal. Touch the negative battery terminal with the tip of the glow plug. You should see a spark and hear a clicking sound from the glow plug. If there is no spark or clicking sound, the glow plug is faulty and needs to be replaced.Reinstall the glow plug: If the glow plug passes both tests, reinstall it back into the engine. Make sure to tighten it securely.Repeat the above steps for each glow plug in the engine."
what is The Function of a Diesel Glow Plug ?	"The diesel glow plug is responsible for warming the cylinders so the engine can ignite the fuel. The glow plugs help keep the engine running as it should. Because of the glow plugs? location, heat can effectively be drawn into the diesel engine. When the weather is ideal, the glow plug is barely needed. However, when temperatures drop, the glow plug must be in optimal condition to warm the cylinder enough for combustion."
differences between Diesel Glow Plugs and Spark Plugs ?	"The glow plugs and spark plugs are very similar in nature but have some differences. Here are a few you will find when you examine the two.1. Fuel TypeFirst, the glow plug is installed in diesel engines, while gasoline engines use spark plugs. With the gas engine, spark plugs are needed to create the spark that ignites air and fuel inside the combustion chamber.However, this isn?t the case with diesel engines. The diesel engine doesn?t need a spark for combustion; it only requires heat, which is increased with the glow plug. 2. HeatGasoline is a volatile substance. It only requires a small spark to trigger combustion. However, diesel fuel requires compression and heat to combust.There must be a high level of heat within the cylinders to produce combustion, which is where the glow plug comes into play. Glow plugs produce an intense heat that helps the engine ignite the fuel/air mixture in the combustion chamber. 3. DurabilityThe glow plug is going to last far longer than most spark plugs. Glow plugs are only used to warm the cylinders for ignition. After that, they are barely needed.On the other hand, the spark plug is working continuously to keep the engine working. Cheap spark plugs might only have a lifetime of about 30,000 miles. 4. Ignition DifferenceThe spark plug takes electrical energy to create a spark. This spark ignite the air and fuel mixture in the combustion chamber.Diesel glow plugs don?t use a spark. They turn electricity into heat, which helps to ignite the fuel and air mixture. "
what is the Diesel Glow Plug Replacement Cost ?	"The replacement cost for diesel glow plugs is only $115 to $300 for the entire set. This price includes parts and labor, with the glow plugs typically costing $75 or less and the labor ending up around $60 to $225, depending on how hard it is to get to the plugs.Some people will prolong changing the glow plugs, but that doesn?t make sense considering how low-cost the job is. Additionally, if you have the right tools and some mechanical know-how, you can replace the plugs yourself. "
What Causes Rough Idle? 	"The most common cause of rough idle is a vacuum leak or a failed PCV valve. It could also be caused by other air-fuel mixture related issues like bad fuel injectors, EGR valves, or low compression. In rare cases, it is caused by misfires from a bad spark plug or coil.While these are not all of the signs, it?s a great place to start. Here?s a more detailed list of the most common causes of rough idle:1. Defective PCV ValvePcv ValveYour car engine?s Positive Crankcase Ventilation takes the unburned gases escaping from the cylinders and moves them from the crankcase, allowing them to go back to the engine for a complete burn. Because the PCV valve is working in the engine, it endures a lot of stress and is often filled with contaminants, such as dirt or sludge.Over time, the valve can become blocked, rendering it useless. This blockage can also create a leak that forces the air/fuel mixture to become lean, leading to a rough idle. To prevent this, you can periodically service the PCV valve. Once it is clogged, you might be able to clean it. Otherwise, it needs to be replaced. 2. Vacuum LeakCar Vacuum Hose LeakThe engine compartment is filled with vacuum hoses, all of which can wear out at any point. Over time, these hoses become brittle and crack. If one gets a leak, it causes a lean air/fuel mixture, which leads to a rough idle. It can also turn into an engine misfire because of the combustion fault inside one or more cylinders. Vacuum leaks can also occur from leaking vacuum supply tanks, vacuum brake boosters, and intake manifold gaskets. When you drive a car with a vacuum leak, you will notice that everything seems fine when the RPMs and speed are up, but idling causes it to run rough. Checking the codes of the computer should indicate a vacuum leak. The air/fuel mixture is going to be lean, and the engine won?t be able to correct it. 3. Dirty Fuel InjectorsFuel Injector LocationWhen the fuel injectors become dirty, a rough idle is just one problem you will experience. You will also notice a sharp decrease in fuel economy.When the injectors get restricted, there?s a significant lack of performance, especially during acceleration. Dirty fuel injectors can be diagnosed through an exhaust gas analyzer because restricted injectors create higher hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide readings.By using an injector cleaner additive regularly, you prevent this situation. Once the injectors are clogged or restricted, an injectable solution will need to be introduced into the system. Fuel injectors often contain a small filter which is easy to replace if the injectors have become clogged, and this is much cheaper than replacing them.4. Carburetor IssuesCarburetorOlder vehicles with high miles are the only ones on the road with a carburetor. However, there are still enough of them for this to be a problem.Carburetor issues produce signature black smoke from the exhaust. Normally, this smoke only occurs once the vehicle has been warmed up.The first thing to check is the choke. It should be completely open once the car is warm. If the choke is open, there?s likely an internal carburetor issue that requires a rebuild. Sometimes, it?s just the ethanol in gasoline that causes the carburetor to go bad.However, you might also experience a problem with the throttle shaft at the carburetor base. This can wear out over time, leading to a vacuum leak. 5. Bad EGR ValveEgr Valve EngineThe Exhaust Gas Recirculation Valve is a vital emission control device. It allows the exhaust gas to enter into the intake manifold, with the sole purpose of reducing emissions from the motor. However, this EGR valve isn?t supposed to operate during idle, at wide open throttle, or before the engine is warmed up. If it runs at any of these times, the performance of the engine is affected. When the EGR valve malfunctions, it doesn?t follow the rules. Instead, it sticks open and leads to a rough idle, or even worse, a stalling engine.The car?s computer should set a code indicating that this component has gone bad. You can also try tapping it to see if you can free the stuck position. Cleaning the dirty EGR valve might be enough to resolve the situation. Otherwise, a low-cost replacement is all that?s needed. 6. Faulty Ignition CoilIgnition Coils E1609781426872The ignition coil is essential to maintaining proper engine performance. It works in conjunction with the spark plugs to ignite the fuel/air mixture. When the car has a faulty coil, it will experience a rough idle, misfire, loss of power, trouble accelerating, and poor fuel economy. As the situation becomes worse, it can also cause the vehicle to stall. 7. Defective Spark Plugs/WiresOil On Spark PlugsThe spark plugs and wires are also critical to the ignition system. Over time, these parts will wear out, especially if contaminants get into the cylinders. However, you can prevent this by regularly changing the spark plugs and wires. Because this is considered a maintenance task, you can find the recommended service interval in your owner?s manual. 8. Low CompressionCompression TestLow compression in your car engine is most noticeable at idle and, therefore, the place where you will notice it first. You can often notice low compression as a ?miss? or misfire on idle.The most common cars to experience a miss caused by low compression are those with more than 100,000 miles. Typically, the miss occurs when compression is low in one of the cylinders. To determine if this is the cause, a compression test needs to be performed. To solve the problem, the engine will need to be disassembled for repair. The valves might need to be replaced for proper compression or the camshaft lobes might be worn out. Either way, it?s not a cheap fix.Luckily, low compression does not happen as often as with older cars and is starting to get quite rare in newer car models.9. Clogged Air FilterDirty Air FilterThe engine air filter is critical for proper operation. It?s meant to keep dust, dirt, and other contaminants from getting into the engine. The paper element can easily become clogged, thereby restricting the airflow into the engine. However, this is another maintenance task that should be performed regularly to keep the engine running the way it should. Ideally, you want to choose a high-quality air filter that isn?t easily clogged. For the small expense, it?s worth protecting your engine. 10. Bad Oxygen SensorsOxygen SensorThe oxygen sensors are vital to the emissions system of your car. They are located in the exhaust system, constantly monitoring the oxygen content of the gases. The information is sent to the engine computer, where it is used to maintain a proper air/fuel mixture.However, oxygen sensors go bad because of the high temperature they are subjected to. Over time, they wear out or suffer from carbon deposit contamination. When this happens, the wrong information is sent to the computer, leading to an improper air/fuel ratio. If the ratio becomes too lean, a rough idle occurs. This fault will create a trouble code that can be read with your scanner. A digital multimeter can also help you pinpoint which oxygen sensor has failed. Whatever is causing your engine to idle rough, it?s important to diagnose the issue quickly and repair it. Ignoring poor engine performance issues only leads to more extensive and costly repairs down the road."
how to fix Rough Idle?	"A rough idle is a common problem in vehicles that can be caused by a number of different factors. Here are some steps to help diagnose and fix the problem:Check for error codes: If the check engine light is on, use an OBD-II scanner to check for error codes. The codes can help narrow down the problem.Check for vacuum leaks: A vacuum leak can cause a rough idle. Check for leaks in the hoses, intake manifold, and throttle body.Clean the throttle body: Over time, the throttle body can become dirty and cause a rough idle. Use a throttle body cleaner and a rag to clean the throttle body.Check the spark plugs: Worn or dirty spark plugs can cause a rough idle. Check the condition of the spark plugs and replace if necessary.Check the ignition coils: Faulty ignition coils can cause a rough idle. Use a multimeter to check the resistance of the coils and replace if necessary.Check the fuel injectors: Dirty or clogged fuel injectors can cause a rough idle. Use a fuel injector cleaner to clean the injectors.Check the air filter: A dirty air filter can restrict airflow and cause a rough idle. Check the air filter and replace if necessary.Check the fuel filter: A clogged fuel filter can restrict fuel flow and cause a rough idle. Check the fuel filter and replace if necessary.If these steps do not fix the problem, it may be necessary to take the vehicle to a mechanic for further diagnosis and repair."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Valve Cover ?	"The most common symptom of a bad valve cover is an oil leak from your engine. You can often notice an oil leak by looking at the oil level or smelling a burning smell while driving. A bad valve cover can also cause misfires or a check engine light on your dashboard.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or leaking valve cover to look for:1. Leaking OilOil Leak On FloorIt?s never a good sign to see leaking oil. However, this simple symptom can be caused by numerous malfunctions.With that said, if the oil is located on the valve cover area or coming from that region, you can assume you have a bad valve cover or gasket. Look around the edge where the gasket seals the cover to the engine.At first, it might just be a small leak that slowly drips onto the ground. Eventually, it could become much larger, coating the entire surface of the valve cover. When this happens, a layer of debris and dirt also starts to accumulate on the cover.Allowing the valve cover to leak oil can cause further damage to the hoses and belts. You don?t want to wait to have it replaced. 2. Low Oil LevelEngine Oil DipstickIf you care about your engine, you are regularly checking the oil levels. If the level continues to be low even though you top it off, you have to assume the oil is going somewhere. Inspect the valve cover for signs of leaking oil that you might have missed. Until you have the valve cover replaced, make sure the motor has sufficient oil, or you could end up with costly repair bills due to engine failure.3. Burning Oil SmellBad Fuel Odor Smell E1609793024317Anytime you smell burning oil, you should be alarmed. The oil leaking out of the valve cover can drip onto the hot engine parts and the exhaust, leaving you with a terrible smell. When you open the hood, the smell should be overpowering, but you might not see where the oil is burning from immediately. This situation can be dangerous. You never want anything burning under the hood that could lead to a car fire. 4. Misfiring EngineMisfiresA misfiring engine can be caused by many factors, such as defective spark plugs or trouble with the fuel system. However, a bad valve cover might also be the culprit.The valve cover could be directly over the engine spark plugs. If there is oil leaking onto the spark plugs, the fluid can make its way into the openings. Oil will prevent the spark plugs from working correctly and cause them to foul.When the spark plugs can?t ignite the air/fuel mixture, it causes the engine to misfire. Not only can this lead to a very rough ride, but it?s also possible to have an engine fire. 5. Dashboard LightsDashboard Warning LightsIf you haven?t been checking the oil regularly, your first sign that something is wrong might be warning lights on the dashboard. You could get the Oil Warning Light telling you that there?s not enough oil pressure in the system, or it could be the Check Engine Light because of defects from the broken valve cover and gasket. Either way, these lights indicate a serious condition, and you should stop driving until a repair is done. "
what is The Function of a Valve Cover ?	"The valve cover protects the vital components of the engine. It?s responsible for covering the valves, thereby protecting the expensive machinery from damage and the elements. However, the valve cover can suffer from misalignment, corrosion and cracks. The valve cover works with the valve cover gasket to provide an effective engine seal. This thin rubber strip is placed between the engine and valve cover. However, the gasket is delicate and more prone to damage than the cover itself. Over time, it becomes brittle or cracks due to heat and old age. "
where is the Valve Cover Location ?	"The valve cover is on top of the engine. It is a hard cover that protects the valves and other engine parts. Between the valve cover and the engine is a gasket that creates a tight seal. Because the gasket generally fails before the valve cover, this part is replaced more often. However, to get to the valve cover gasket, the valve cover must be removed. "
hat is the Valve Cover Replacement Cost ?	"The average valve cover gasket replacement cost is between $90 and $400, depending on your make and model. You can buy a new valve cover gasket for about $40 to $50, but most of the expense is spent on labor. Expect it to cost between $50 and $350 to replace the valve cover gasket. Unless the valve cover has received extensive damage, it shouldn?t need to be replaced. Most likely, it?s only the valve cover gasket that needs removal. To replace the gasket, the valve cover also has to be removed. So, whether you need a gasket or valve cover replacement, you are likely looking at the same labor charge."
what are the Symptoms Boost Leak ?	"1. Slow Turbo SpoolTurbo SpoolThe turbo works by increasing the amount of air and fuel that can be fit into a cylinder; thus, increasing horsepower and performance. However, before the turbo ?kicks in,? it?s turbine needs to spin very fast. Until that happens, the turbo does not play a role in boosting the car.This issue, usually called turbo lag, is when the turbo spools air and fuel to send into the cylinder. If this process is slower than usual, you are experiencing a boost leak. The concept is simple; due to a leak, it takes more time for a turbo to fill up the boost pipes.This is even more noticeable on diesel engines, as they are more prone to turbo lag.2. Loss of PowerSlow Car AccelerationWhile you are accelerating, the turbo builds pressure in the boost pipes to give the car higher performance. If there is a boost leak, it will take longer to fill these pipes with pressure, and the pressure will be lower than usual.This will cause a drastic loss of power in your car engine. If the leak is big, it can even mean that you lose all turbo pressure.3. Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light On Dashboard E1609869927250The check engine light monitors all sensors of a car engine, including the boost pressure sensor.If there is anything wrong with the turbo boost pressure ? as happens when you have a boost leak ? it will light up the check engine light.If you see a check engine light on your dashboard, check the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner.4. Black Smoke from the ExhaustBlack Smoke From ExhaustThe MAF sensor measures the air going into the engine. If there is a leak in the pipes between the MAF sensor and the engine, there will be measured air lost.This will cause a wrong air-fuel mixture and, in most cases, a rich mixture. A too-rich mixture will cause black smoke from the exhaust pipe. So if you experience black smoke from the exhaust when accelerating, it is definitely time to check for any boost leaks.5. Poor Fuel EconomyFuel ConsumptionThe same thing applies to the fuel consumption of the boost leak and the measurement of the MAF sensor.This might not be distinguishable very easily, but if you keep an eye on your car?s average fuel consumption, you will catch a boost leak easily.If the car is consuming more fuel than it should, you have a problem. A boost leak test can prove to be helpful in such situations.6. Poor IdlingCar Engine Rough IdleThis only holds if you have a car with a mass airflow sensor or MAS/MAF. The MAF senses the amount of air leaving the turbo and entering the engine.If there is a big boost leak, your car will have problems idling perfectly. It might stall and shut down as a result of the leak.It is not very common to have a poor idle because of a boost pipe leak, though it can happen if the leak is large. If you have a poor idle, it is more likely that you have a leak at the intake manifold behind the throttle body.What is a boost leak?Boost PipesA boost leak is a type of air leak in the intake path just before the engine cylinders. It is basically a loose clamp or damaged hose that cannot handle the turbo boost?s pressure.Ignoring a boost leak will eventually reduce your turbo?s life and, in turn, the car engine?s life.The ECU determines the ratio of fuel to air; however, if there is leakage of air along the way, the ratio is incorrectly calculated.Diesel engines are accommodating in this regard, as they are more tolerant of a high fuel to air ratio. However, petrol engines are sensitive. Therefore, a boost leak inspection is necessary for your car?s optimal performance."
How to Find a Boost Leak ?	"To find a boost leak easily, you should use an EVAP smoke machine. With this type of device, you will find boost leaks in no time.The machine pressurizes the boost pipes with smoke, and if there is smoke coming from somewhere in the engine bay, you most likely have a boost leak there.If you have a small workshop, it is definitely time to invest in one. You can see my recommendations for EVAP smoke machines here: Best EVAP smoke machines.The hard way to find a boost leak is by trying to find it visually. Check all the boost pipes and hoses to make sure that none of them came loose.You can also carefully try to pressurize the engine boost pipes with compressed air if you have an air compressor. Be very careful, though, because engines run very well on pressurized air!! Ensure the wheels are in the air so they won?t start going forward because of the pressurized air, and be very careful with the pressure."
How to Reduce Black Smoke from Diesel Engines ?	"To reduce the black smoke in a diesel engine, you want to first inspect and change the engine air filter if it?s dirty. You also want to clean the MAF sensor, inspect the fuel system and use a diesel fuel additive.Here are some more detailed steps on how to reduce the black smoke from a diesel engine:1. Change the Air FilterNew Engine Air FilterThe first thing you should do if you want to reduce black smoke from your diesel engine is to check the air filter and replace it if it?s dirty.Black smoke is a clear indication that the fuel is only being partially burned in the combustion chamber. When a functioning diesel engine burns fuel, water and CO2 are left behind. Black smoke is an indicator that something is preventing the fuel from burning completely, normally caused by an imbalanced air-fuel ratio.The first place to look is at the air mixture heading into the combustion chamber. The easiest repair would be to replace the engine air filter, which might be clogged. If there?s not enough air making its way to the engine, the air-fuel ratio is going to run rich, leaving behind unburned diesel fuel. "
what are the Symptoms of a Clogged Air Filter ?	"Aside from black smoke coming from the diesel vehicle, you can also expect to experience some other symptoms. The imbalance creates a lack of power, especially during acceleration or if you are pushing the engine hard.Because the engine isn?t running as it should, there will also be a decrease in fuel economy. You can take the engine air filter out and inspect it. If it looks dirty and clogged, replace it for better performance. "
what is the Cost to Replace Air Filter ?	"The average air filter only costs between $10 and $75. Changing the air filter is something you can do on your own and it only takes a few minutes. The air filter should be changed as part of your regularly scheduled maintenance. Check your owner?s manual to find out how often you should change yours, but most automakers recommend every 12,000 to 15,000 miles. 2. Replace or Clean the MAF SensorIntake And Maf SensorAnother issue that could be affecting the air-fuel ratio is a bad MAF sensor. The mass airflow sensor ensures that the right amount of fuel gets mixed with the air entering the combustion chamber. When the MAF sensor fails, it could read the wrong amount of airflow entering the system, causing more or less fuel to be added than necessary. What you are left with is black smoke from unburned fuel and a long list of other problems. If you are lucky, it is often enough to clean the MAF sensor carefully with an electronic cleaner. But you need to be very careful so you do not damage the sensor."
what are the Symptoms of Bad MAF Sensor ?	"Normally, when the MAF sensor goes bad, the Check Engine Light comes on. You should be able to read the trouble codes with your OBDII scanner. However, you might also notice black smoke coming from the exhaust or have trouble accelerating. A bad mass airflow sensor can also lead to a rough idle, poor fuel economy and hard starting. "
what is the Cost to Replace MAF Sensor ?	"The MAF sensor replacement cost is between $220 and $350. Parts are going to make up about $175 to $280 of that cost.Labor only makes up about $45 to $70 of the total replacement cost. It?s not difficult to replace most MAF sensors on your own with some basic mechanical knowledge. 3. Use Diesel AdditiveFuel AdditiveThe final way to reduce black smoke might be the easiest solution, but it isn?t going to solve all of your engine problems. If the vehicle is older with a lot of miles, the issue might just be caused by accumulated carbon buildup. With a diesel additive, the carbon buildup can be cleaned for a more efficient engine. However, you want to ensure you choose a high-quality diesel additive, such as Liqui Moly or Lucas. "
what are the Signs the Engine Needs a Diesel Additive ?	"Diesel additives are great for accomplishing more than simply fixing the black smoke situation. You can find a variety of fuel additives on the market, each with unique ingredients for a specific purpose.For example, you might choose to use a fuel additive before winter to stabilize the fuel. You can also pick a formulation that has detergents for a cleaner engine that promotes longevity. "
what is the Cost of Diesel Additive ?	"The majority of diesel additives will cost you less than $15 a bottle. You will need to read the directions to determine how often a bottle should be used and how much fuel to put it in.The best part about using a diesel fuel additive is that it?s simple to use. Just pour the contents of the bottle into the fuel tank when you fill-up. Hopefully, the additive reduces the instance of black smoke and helps you keep your diesel engine in better condition.4. Inspect Fuel SystemDiesel Fuel SystemThe other part of the air-fuel mixture is the diesel itself. The fuel system is made of numerous parts that could be causing the issue. You will want to look at the obvious and simpler parts first.Start with the fuel filter, EGR system or the injector timing. In some cases, it?s just a matter of having a bad fuel filter or an EGR valve that needs to be replaced. You should also consider that a clogged injector might be to blame. If a fuel injector cleaner doesn?t work, you will need to replace it. The easiest way to control the fuel system is by checking the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner. Modern diesel engines control everything electronically and usually, it will tell you when there is something wrong with the fuel system also."
what are the Symptoms of Bad Fuel Delivery ?	"When a diesel engine gets the wrong amount of fuel, you could see black smoke coming from the exhaust. In addition, you might notice a rough idle and poor overall performance.Additionally, the truck will likely have reduced fuel economy because the engine isn?t running at its best. You may even smell fuel if it isn?t being burned correctly. "
what is the Cost to Repair Diesel Fuel System ?	"The least expensive repair would be changing the fuel filter. On average, a new fuel filter will cost between $50 and $100 for the parts. These should also be changed regularly, between 10,000 to 25,000 miles, depending on the type of filter you use and the manufacturer?s recommendations.On the flip side, replacing a diesel injection pump can be costly. You could spend between $1,700 and $2,400 for the total job, with parts costing $1,200 to $1,700 and labor equaling $500 to $700. "
What Are The Symptoms of a Vacuum Leak?	"The main symptoms of a vacuum leak include:Rough idleHigh idle RPMRough/Slow AccelerationCheck engine lightMisfires and backfiresHigh pitch noise from the engineThe engine is very sensitive to calculating the air entering the engine, to calculate the right air-fuel mixture. Therefore, a vacuum leak causes a lot of different symptoms. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a vacuum leak to look for:1. Rough IdleCar Engine Rough IdleThe car engine is most sensitive to problems at idle. Therefore, it is no surprise that rough idle will be one of the strongest vacuum leak symptoms.This is mainly because the throttle body is trying to hold a stable idle by opening and closing the throttle valve. If you have a major vacuum leak, the throttle body will have a problem trying to control it, resulting in strange idle symptoms.It can also be because the air-fuel mixture is out of balance as a result of the vacuum leak.2. High Idle RPMHigh Idle RpmYou have vacuum pressure in the intake manifold on idle because the throttle body is restricting the engine from revving up. If you have a vacuum leak, it will allow more air to enter the engine, allowing it to rev up.This is why you will, in many cases, experience a high engine idle RPM as one of the most common vacuum leak symptoms.3. Rough/Slow AccelerationSlow Acceleration CarA vacuum leak will often result in rough or slow acceleration because the engine will get the wrong air/fuel ratio when uncalculated air is entering or leaving the engine.A vacuum leak normally results in a lean mixture, and a lean mixture often results in slow acceleration. You can feel it like the engine is trying to speed up, but something is holding it back.There are a lot of other things that can cause slow acceleration, so always make a proper diagnosis before replacing parts.4. Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light Reset ItselfThe engine control unit controls all the car?s sensors all the time while you are driving your car. If one of these sensors is sending faulty information to the engine control unit, it will light up the check engine light.Vacuum leaks can often result in a check engine light on your dashboard, and you will often find a trouble code in the ECU memory telling you that the ECU has recognized a lean mixture.5. Misfires & BackfiresCar MisfiresYour engine often starts to misfire and backfire when it has a vacuum leak. When it has a vacuum leak, the air/fuel mixture can sometimes get so lean that your car cannot fire the cylinders properlyIt will also often result in misfire trouble codes, like the P0300 trouble code. When your car is misfiring on one specific engine, it is usually caused by a vacuum leak around the intake manifold gasket. If you have misfires on all cylinders, it can be a vacuum leak anywhere around the intake manifold.6. High pitch noise from the engineCar Engine NoiseBroken vacuum hoses can often result in a high pitch noises because the engine is sucking air all the time through the leak, which will create noises.If this is the case, you are lucky, because it?s a lot easier to identify a vacuum leak if you have a high pitch sound. Just listen to find where the sound comes from."
What could cause a Vacuum Leak? 	"The most common causes of a vacuum leak are a cracked vacuum hose or a leaking intake manifold gasket. It can also leak from the throttle body gasket or, in rare cases, a cracked intake manifold.Even if it sounds like an easy job to find a vacuum leak, it can sometimes be time-consuming. There are a lot of different parts that can cause a vacuum leak.Smoke Machine TestingSo do you suspect that you have a vacuum leak by looking at the symptoms above? Let?s find out if it is true!Finding a vacuum leak is actually relatively easy, and there are several different methods to find a vacuum leak with or without special tools. You can find more information about how you can find the vacuum leak here in our other article: How to find a vacuum leak."
How do I know if you have a vacuum leak?	"You will often notice that your idle is higher than usual, and you may have a check engine light on your dashboard when you have a vacuum leak in your car. You can also have other symptoms like bad engine performance or misfires."
Is a vacuum leak expensive to fix?	"In most cases, a vacuum leak is caused by a cracked or broken vacuum hose, which can often be fixed for under 10$. However, vacuum leaks can be caused by more serious problems like a cracked intake manifold, which can cost up to 1000$ to fix."
Can I drive with a vacuum leak?	"A small vacuum leak is not super-dangerous for your engine to drive with. However, it is always recommended to repair the vacuum leak as soon as possible. If your engine is running poorly because of the vacuum leak, you should not drive your car until the problem has been resolved. Never put strain on your engine if you know that it has a vacuum leak."
Can a vacuum leak ruin your engine?	"A major vacuum leak can cause the air-fuel mixture to become very lean. A very lean mixture can cause a lot of heat inside the engine, which can cause internal engine parts to get damaged. A vacuum leak can ruin your engine?s parts if you are very unlucky and put a lot of load on your engine."
What is a Head Gasket?	"The head gasket is located on the engine. It?s a thin strip of metal that contains holes, resembling a piece of Swiss cheese. When the motor is put together, the head gasket is placed between the engine block and the cylinder heads. The purpose of the head gasket is to maintain the appropriate tolerances between these two heavy metal parts. Basically, the gasket ensures that the oil passages and coolant flow remain separate from one another. The head gasket must be precisely placed and secured to ensure that everything is sealed properly. In most engines, the head gasket will last the lifetime of the vehicle. The only time it would require replacement is if there were major engine repairs being performed. However, a faulty head gasket can create problems. The gasket does move slightly as the engine heats up and cools down. With each operating cycle, the head gasket must absorb and dissipate the heat properly to ensure the seals continue working as they should. When the head gasket is faulty, oil and coolant start to mix, creating a costly situation. "
what is the Subaru Head Gasket Problems ?	"The Subaru EJ251, EJ252 and EJ253 engines are the most susceptible to head gasket problems due to the composite-style head gaskets. These 2.5-liter engines came in several configurations and were updated during production a few times.While any engine could endure a head gasket failure, there are some Subaru models that are specifically known for this problem. It turns out that the design of the engines resulted in head gasket trouble. "
What Models are Affected by Subaru Head Gasket Problems?	"Subaru head gasket problems seem to affect the following models the most:1999-2010 Forester 1999-2011 Impreza 2000-2009 Outback 2000-2009 Legacy 2003-2005 Baja Of course, the boxer engine might also be to blame because of the design. With a Subaru boxer motor, the engine lays flat instead of standing up like most models. In these engines, the pistons move from side to side.While the engines contain fabulous weight and balance properties, fluids pool up next to the head gasket instead of draining normally after the engine is turned off. Even when the parts are upgraded, the acids from the fluids start to eat away at the seal. "
what is the Signs of a Blown Subaru Head Gasket ?	"1. Overheated EngineOverheating Engine On RoadNot only can a head gasket fail because the engine overheats, but it can lead to other problems, too. When the head gasket isn?t sealed as it should be, hot gases from the exhaust end up in the cooling system, or the coolant can leak into the cylinders. Either way, you end up with an overheating engine.If you continue driving while the engine is overheated, the cylinder heads can warp. Steam can also cause damage to the catalytic converter, leaving you with an even bigger repair bill. 2. Power Loss Any leakage in the engine block can cause performance to suffer. When the compressed air or fuel is able to escape, compression in the engine is reduced.A lack of compression creates an engine that runs rough and doesn?t respond. There could also be sounds that resemble an exhaust leak. 3. Oil ContaminationWhen the head gasket blows, it?s common to see a milky sludge on the dipstick or under the oil filler cap. This substance has been referred to as a milkshake, and is caused by the coolant mixing with the oil.When coolant gets into the oil, continuing to drive will damage the bearings of the engine. Not only will the head gasket need to be replaced at this point, but the engine will need to be flushed and equipped with a new filter. You should also have the bottom end disassembled to check the bearings. 4. White SmokeIf white smoke starts pouring out of the exhaust, it?s a tell-tale sign of a blown head gasket. This smoke will likely smell sweet because of the antifreeze that has leaked past the head gasket into the cylinders. As part of the combustion process, the coolant turns into steam. However, if the leak is coming from an oil passage, the smoke might be blue instead, although this happens less frequently. 5. External LeaksWhen the gasket fails between the oil or water passages and the exterior of the engine, you will notice either an oil or coolant leak. While this condition is still serious, it?s the least worrisome way for a head gasket to blow.At first, you will notice a dropping fluid level, and you might also spot the leak. However, if the fluids get too low, you could end up with other engine issues, so don?t ignore the problem. Of course, leaking fluids can also cause a car fire, so you need to use caution. "
Subaru Head Gasket Replacement Cost ?	"The average Subaru head gasket replacement cost is going to be $2,000 to $4,000. Sadly, the labor alone can make up $1,200 to $3,000 of that bill. Typically, you can look at a parts bill ranging from $800 to $1,500, especially once the tensioners, idlers, water pump, timing belt and seals are added in. Additionally, if your Subaru has a manual transmission, you could spend up to $500 more on the total cost. Repairing a head gasket is not something for the average DIY mechanic to tackle. The car will be in the shop for at least a few days and an engine specialist should work on your Subaru, because the motor needs to be dismantled to ensure everything is fixed properly."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad or Clogged Catalytic Converter ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad catalytic converter are a sulfur smell when the engine is warm and a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice engine performance issues like acceleration lag, higher or lower fuel consumption, and a misfiring engine.While these are not all possible symptoms, they are the most common ones. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or clogged catalytic converter to look for:1. Check Engine LightFlashing Check Engine LightThe check engine light, one of the most obvious indicators of a malfunction with your car, is also one of the strongest indicators of a bad catalytic converter. When checked with a compatible OBD scanner, it will show you a catalytic converter-related trouble code that must be decoded with the help of the operating manual.The most common trouble code when it comes to a bad catalytic converter is the P0420 code.2. Acceleration LagPoor AccelerationIf you observe delays when accelerating or a decrease in power when driving in steep areas while all other parts like spark plugs, filters, sensors, etc. are fine, then it could be the catalytic converter that?s bad.Mechanics often misdiagnose the symptoms of a faulty catalytic converter as being caused by a bad oxygen sensor or any other sensor.To check if your catalytic converter is clogged, keep your hand close to the exhaust pipe end and ask someone to push the accelerator pedal to increase your car?s RPM to 2000. If you get a meager amount of exhaust coming out, you might have a clogged catalytic converter. Compare the flow to a similar car if possible.3. High or low fuel consumptionBad Fuel ConsumptionBetter or worse gas mileage is one of the symptoms of a poor catalytic converter. While better gas mileage may sound like a good deal, it can damage your engine and may cause even more expensive repairs.Due to improper combustion of the fuel when the exhaust is clogged, it will make your car engine to be much less efficient and it needs to work harder for the same amount of power. Therefore, a bad catalytic converter will most often cause a higher fuel consumption, even if lower is possible in some cases.4. Smell of sulfurWhen the catalytic converter is clogged, it will restrict the airflow of exhaust fumes so that the engine?s air-fuel mixture will get rich (too much fuel, leading to unburnt fuel)The combustion of this excessive air-fuel mixture causes a smell like rotten eggs or burnt sulfur, which is an obvious indication of your catalytic converter?s malfunction.5. Discolored HousingIf you see that the catalytic converter?s housing has turned blue or some other color, it could mean that the catalytic converter is clogged and is creating excessive heat.This could also happen if your engine is not running as it should and unburnt fuel is entering the catalyst. This mixture then ignites in the converter due to the heat and melts its inner material, causing even more blockages.If your catalytic converter is clogged, it could also create excessive heat inside the engine, which could damage other parts quite quickly. Therefore, you should not drive your car if you suspect that the catalytic converter is bad.6. Starting IssuesIf the catalytic converter is clogged, the engine will get too much fuel that the engine cannot burn. It will also create back pressure which will cause the engine to struggle to get rid of the exhaust fumes.If your car starts for 2-3 seconds and then dies, it could definitely be caused by a clogged converter. This is because it may take 2-3 seconds for the pressure to rise in the exhaust system until the engine is choked and shuts off.7. Increased EmissionsIf your catalytic converter is damaged or clogged, there is a risk that the catalytic converter is not doing its job properly anymore. This will cause an increase in the car engine?s emissions. The overall purpose of the catalytic converter is to remove bad emissions, so this is probably quite obvious.You will often notice this by seeing dark exhaust smoke coming from your exhaust pipe during acceleration or at idle. If you have a yearly car inspection in the state or country you live in, your car will most likely fail an emission test or smog test.8. Engine MisfiresWhen the catalytic converter is clogged, it restricts the flow of oxygen in engines, and engines require a lot of oxygen for proper fuel combustion. This reduced airflow leads to overheating due to an excessive amount of unburned gases and may also lead to a misfiring engine.If your engine is misfiring, you should get it fixed as soon as possible, because it can lead to further expensive repairs if you just ignore it.9. Rattles or other noisesInside the catalytic converter, there is a ?honeycomb? that can get worn out and this can cause the honeycomb to break apart into pieces. This will cause a rattling noise from the catalytic converter when you rev your car engine.You can ask a friend to press the accelerator pedal while you try to listen under the car if the rattling noises are coming from the catalytic converter or somewhere else."
What is a catalytic converter? 	"The catalytic converter is a device located in the exhaust system of a car. The catalytic converter consists of a catalyst that helps convert the car?s pollutant gases into less harmful pollutants. The structure of the catalytic converter has the look of a honeycomb.The honeycomb shape aims to ensure that the pollutant gases flow through the more exposed surface and converts Nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons into safer elements like carbon dioxide . Despite being one of the most expensive products, Platinum is normally used as a catalyst in catalytic converters. However, in some cases, rhodium and palladium are also used.Since combustion occurs in the engine, all the burnt gases flow at about 800 degrees through the exhaust pipe, which passes through the catalytic converter, thus affecting the engine?s exhaust gas flow. A perfect converter usually lasts up to 10 years. The honeycomb structure of the catalytic converter starts to suffocate slowly, which affects the engine?s performance."
What could damage a catalytic converter?	"Catalytic converters are often getting worn with time and it most likely has to get replaced one or more times during your car?s lifetime. Some car models even have a service schedule of when it should be replaced (Even if most people don?t follow this because of the expensive replacement cost).If your car engine is combusting motor oil, caused by worn piston rings or clogged crankcase ventilation, it could cause damages to the catalytic converter really fast. Other causes could be contaminants like unburned fuel caused by misfires. Coolant entering the combustion chamber by a blown head gasket could also cause damage to the honeycomb."
Catalytic Converter Theft ?	"Catalytic converters contain precious metals like small amounts of platinum, rhodium, and palladium. These metals are very attractive to thieves since scrap yards will pay well for a used catalytic converter.Catalytic converters are also relatively easy to steal because you just have to cut off the pipe with a tiger saw or something similar and it?s done in under 3 minutes. If you want to learn more about how to protect your catalytic converter from getting stolen you can check out our other article: How To Protect Your Car Against Catalytic Converter Theft"
Catalytic Converter Location ?	"The catalytic converter is located on the exhaust pipe system, between your muffler and the exhaust pipe manifold.Depending on the car engine, the distance where it?s installed from the engine could differ a lot. On some engines, the catalytic converter is installed directly on the exhaust manifold, while on others it could be installed almost in the middle of the exhaust pipe."
Catalytic Converter Replacement ?	"Replacing or repairing the catalytic converter is often very expensive and often not worth the cost, if your car is old. There are some workshops that replace the honeycomb inside the catalytic converter and keep the outer parts. This could be worth on some expensive catalytic converters, but in most cases, it?s easier and cheaper to just buy a new one.The average catalytic converter replacement cost is between $400 and $2500. You can learn more about the replacement costs here: Catalytic converter replacement cost."
how to Test A Catalytic Converter ?	"A catalytic converter is an important component of a vehicle's exhaust system that helps to reduce harmful emissions. Testing a catalytic converter can be done with a few simple steps:Check the check engine light: If the check engine light is on, it may be a sign of a faulty catalytic converter. Use an OBD-II scanner to check for error codes related to the catalytic converter.Check for physical damage: Inspect the catalytic converter for any physical damage, such as dents or cracks. Any damage can affect its performance and may need to be replaced.Measure the temperature: Use an infrared thermometer to measure the temperature of the catalytic converter. The temperature should be significantly higher at the inlet than at the outlet. If the temperatures are similar, the catalytic converter may not be functioning properly.Perform a vacuum test: Use a vacuum gauge to perform a vacuum test on the engine. Connect the gauge to a vacuum source on the engine and note the reading. Then, disconnect the vacuum hose from the EGR valve and connect it to the vacuum gauge. Note the reading again.

Can a bad catalytic converter ruin your engine? 	"Yes, it can but it is more likely that your engine will just shut off and not run until you fix the damaged catalytic converter. A clogged or damaged catalytic can create high backpressure into the engine which can damage other parts of your car?s engine or emission system, which could lead to severe engine failure."
What is the average life of a catalytic converter?	"The average lifespan of a catalytic converter is roughly ten years or 100,000 miles. However, there are many factors that can affect the lifespan of a catalytic converter such as the quality of the converter, the type of vehicle it?s in, and how well the vehicle is maintained. Many catalytic converters will last the life of the car, while others have a scheduled service for when the catalytic converter is to be replaced."
What does a bad catalytic converter sound like?	"If you can hear a rattling noise coming from the catalytic converter it can mean it?s bad. However, unfortunately, there isn?t necessarily one specific sound from the exhaust that indicates a problem with the catalytic converter."
How do you fix a catalytic converter without replacing it?	"If there is severe damage to the catalytic converter, there is no other way than to replace it or remove the catalytic converter and reprogram the ECU. But if it is just clogged, you can clean the catalyst."
what are the Symptoms Bad or Clogged Fuel Filter ?	"The main symptoms of a bad or clogged fuel filter include:Difficulty Starting the CarMisfiring EngineBad PerformanceCheck Engine Light IlluminatesEngine StallingWhile these are the most common signs and a quick look at them, it?s far from all of them. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or clogged fuel filter to look for:1. Difficulty Starting the CarHard StartingThe first symptom you might notice if your fuel filter is starting to get clogged is difficulty starting the car. The starting moment for a car engine is pretty critical, and a lot of fuel is required.If the filter is clogged, you may have a tough time trying to start your car if the fuel pressure gets too low.2. Misfiring EngineSpark Plug MisfiresIf fuel only intermittently gets into the engine, it can lead to low fuel pressure, which often leads to misfiring and other hiccups.You can feel engine misfires as small jerks when you are accelerating your car, but also on idle. If you notice many misfires when accelerating your car, it is definitely time to check when your filter was replaced.3. Bad PerformancePoor AccelerationA clogged fuel filter leads to low fuel pressure, and as you might know ? the engine prefers a lot of fuel for its maximum performance.If the fuel pressure gets too low, you will probably feel that your car is much slower than usual.4. Check Engine Light IlluminatesP0420 Check Engine LightModern vehicles have sensors placed on every square inch of the car engine and send signals to the car?s computer that tell it if something is wrong.The computer then illuminates the ?Check Engine? light on the dashboard and asks you to have the car checked.If the fuel filter is faulty, the fuel?s pressure entering the system drops, which alerts the fuel pressure sensor, and the ?Check Engine? light comes on.5. Engine StallingEngine Stall E1609780473516You might also experience your engine stalls when trying to accelerate the car or even on idle.This is because the fuel pressure drops so low that the engine will be out of fuel and die completely."
How often should you change the fuel filter?	"The replacement interval differs between car models and fuel type. As a rule of thumb, you should at least change your fuel filter every 37.000 miles (60.000 km) or every 4th year.Petrol cars do usually have longer replacement intervals and do not get clogged as often as diesel filters.The fuel filter should be replaced earlier on a few car models, so you should always check your repair manual for the exact replacement interval.Some cars do not have to replace it that often either. Actually, many cars have a replacement interval for up to 75.000 miles (120.000km) before you need to replace them.Of course, this does change depending on what type of fuel you fill your car with also. Some countries have worse fuel quality, and then you have to replace it more often."
where the Fuel Filter Location ?	"The fuel filter is usually located somewhere near the fuel tank, under the car. It can also be located under the hood or somewhere on the way behind the plastic covers under the car.The fuel filter location can differ a lot, and your best bet to find the location is to check in the engine bay and near the fuel tank under the car.If you can?t find it, check your repair manual or call your authorized dealer."
what is the Fuel Filter Replacement Cost ?	"The average fuel filter replacement cost is between $30 and $210, depending on the car model and labor costs. The fuel filter can cost between $10 and $60, while labor costs can vary between $20 and $150.The fuel filter installed in your vehicle is one of those components that require frequent and regular maintenance.The fuel filter price is usually reasonable, and it can easily be replaced with instructions in the service manual if you have some basic knowledge of car repairs.The parts required for a replacement will cost you on average between $10 and $60 for most cars.However, if you are willing to hire a professional or mechanic to do this, there are high additional labor costs."
hwa to Check the Fuel Filter ?	"Checking the fuel filter is an important part of vehicle maintenance as a clogged fuel filter can cause engine problems, such as reduced power, poor fuel efficiency, and even engine damage. Here are the steps to check the fuel filter:Locate the fuel filter: The fuel filter is typically located along the fuel lines, either under the vehicle or in the engine compartment.Depressurize the fuel system: Before removing the fuel filter, it is important to depressurize the fuel system to prevent fuel from spraying out. To do this, locate the fuel pump fuse or relay and remove it. Then, start the engine and let it run until it stalls. This will relieve the pressure in the fuel system.Remove the fuel filter: Use a wrench or pliers to remove the fuel filter from the fuel line. Be careful not to damage the fuel lines or fittings.Inspect the fuel filter: Check the condition of the fuel filter. If it is dirty or clogged, it may need to be replaced. If it is clean, it can be reused.Check for fuel flow: To check for fuel flow, hold the fuel filter over a container and turn the ignition on for a few seconds. Fuel should flow freely through the filter. If it does not, there may be a blockage in the fuel line or a problem with the fuel pump.Reinstall the fuel filter: If the fuel filter is clean and functioning properly, reinstall it back into the fuel line. Make sure to tighten the fittings securely.It is recommended to replace the fuel filter every 30,000 to 40,000 miles or as recommended by the vehicle manufacturer. A clogged fuel filter can cause engine problems, so regular maintenance is important for optimal vehicle performance."
How do I unclog your fuel filter?	"Although you can potentially unclog a fuel filter with compressed air or water, it is not recommended. Fuel filters are pretty cheap and trying to save some money and clean the filter will only lead to more problems. Fuel filters also have a service schedule, so if it?s been a while since it was replaced, you should definitely change it."
Can I drive with a clogged fuel filter?	"No, you should not drive with a clogged fuel filter. Your car?s fuel filter is responsible for keeping contaminants out of the fuel system, and if it becomes clogged, fuel can?t flow properly through the system. This can cause all sorts of problems, from decreased performance to higher emissions to complete engine failure. So if your fuel filter is clogged, get it replaced as soon as possible."
Will a clogged fuel filter throw a code? 	"Yes, a clogged fuel filter can cause an error code. If the fuel filter is clogged, the engine will most likely run lean, causing the ECM to throw a lean air-fuel mixture or misfire related trouble codes. You may see codes like P0171 or P0300."
Can I change my fuel filter myself?	"Many fuel filters are fairly easy to change, so with some basic knowledge, it shouldn?t be a problem with most car models. However, on some car models it can be very tricky and you may need to use a repair manual. Remember to use safety equipment as gas is dangerous."
Loose or Bad Alternator Belt Symptoms ?	"The main symptoms of a loose or bad alternator belt include:Battery / Alternator warning lightSquealing Noise when coldHeavy or jiggery steeringFlickering or Dimming LightsSudden stallDead batteryThe alternator belt powers not only the alternator but also many other parts in the engine bay. Therefore, a lot of other things can fail as well if the alternator belt becomes loose.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a loose or bad alternator belt to look for:1. Battery / Alternator Warning LightBattery Light OnAs the alternator or serpentine belt is powering the alternator, it will, of course, cause the alternator to struggle when the belt is loose. There is a battery warning light on your dashboard in most car models, which will light up when there is a problem with the charging system.When the alternator belt is loose, the alternator will not spin at its optimal speed, and this can cause the charging voltage to drop, and therefore, the warning light will pop up.2. Squealing Noise when coldNoise In CarYou have probably heard that many older car models have a really high pitch noise when starting them cold, which will slowly fade away as the engine becomes warmer.This is mainly due to a loose alternator belt, which will become more slippery and wet when it is cold and create a high pitch noise when it slips on the alternator.If you have a high pitch noise when you start the car for a few seconds, it is definitely time to check the alternator belt. You might also experience a constant high pitch noise if the belt is always loose.3. Heavy or Jiggery SteeringTurn Steering Wheel E1609947180429As I talked about before, the alternator or serpentine belt is powering the alternator and other things like the power steering pump. Some car models have a separate belt for the alternator and the power steering pump, but models use just one.This means that the alternator belt can also cause the power steering pump not to function properly, and you will recognize this as a jigger or constant heavy steering.4. Flickering or Dimming LightsDim Headlights CarWhen the alternator is charging the car battery, it will charge it with around 14.5 volts. When the car battery is idle, it mostly has around 12-12.5 volts. When the alternator is not functioning properly because of a slipping or loose alternator belt, the voltage will also cause spikes and drops.You will recognize these voltage shiftings mostly by looking at the headlights or other electronic components. You can see the light become darker or brighter, and you can also see a pulsing light in some cases.5. Sudden StallEngine StallIf you have been driving very far with a loose or slipping alternator belt, it can actually become so bad that the electronic components will draw more power than the alternator can produce.This will cause the car to stall completely, and you will become stranded on the road, because there is no chance that you can start it again when the car battery is completely drained.6. Dead BatteryDead Car BatteryIf the alternator belt is a little bit loose, it might charge the car battery, but not well enough. This is most noticeable when you are trying to start the car. If it sounds exhausted on the starter, it can be a sign of a loose alternator belt.If it gets bad enough, it can even cause the car battery to be completely dead the next time you try to start your car."
Just tighten it or replace it?	"To determine if you should replace or tighten the alternator belt, you need to look at the belt. If it has cracks or looks very dry, it is definitely time to replace the alternator belt.When buying a new belt, you need to compare it with the old belt to make sure you got the same length, as many car models can have many different belt lengths depending on the utilities like power steering, air condition, etc.When tightening the new alternator belt, you have to make sure not to tighten it too tight. This will cause a much shorter lifespan, and it can even damage the bearings in the parts like the alternator or power steering pump.Most newer car models use an automatic belt tensioner also, so it is quite uncommon that the belt will become loose. However, it can happen, and if you have a loose belt on a car with an automatic belt tensioner, you have to make sure the replace the tensioner while you replace the alternator belt."
where the Alternator Belt Location ?	"The alternator belt is located on the front of the engine. This is not the same as the front of the car, because the engine can be installed sideways in many car models.Finding the alternator belt is quite easy in most car models, though. Look for a belt going around different wheels, and you will most likely find it.In some car models, the belt can be located quite low down in the engine bay and close to the car?s body, making it difficult to see from above. In this case, you may have to lift the car and check from underneath."
what is the Alternator Belt Replacement Cost ?	"The average alternator belt replacement cost is between $50 to $300 depending on the car model. An alternator belt costs $20-$100, and labor costs $30-$200 to replace it.The alternator belt is often quite cheap, so if you know to replace and tighten it yourself, you can definitely save some money.As I talked about before, most modern car models use an automatic belt tensioner, and if you have a loose belt on one of these car models, you have to replace the tensioner. These tensioners are often slightly more pricey, and you can expect to pay $30?$150 for a new one.The alternator can be installed very closely on the car?s body, making it very difficult to reach it. In some car models, you even have to lift or lower the engine to reach it properly. "
Factors Affecting Cost to Rebuild an Engine ?	"1. Car Make/ModelThe type of car you drive has a profound impact on the cost of rebuilding the engine. If you drive a car with a small four-cylinder motor, you are going to spend far less than if you have a big V8.For example, you might only spend $2,000. Not only will fewer parts be needed, but there is less labor involved. 2. Parts NeededWith a simple rebuild, the bearings and seals will need to be replaced. If there is no other major damage, that might be enough to get you back on the road.However, severe issues can quickly add to the cost. For example, if the motor has a scored crankshaft or the cylinder head is beyond repair, you could quickly spend much more money. At some point, it might be time to think about an engine replacement instead. 3. Rebuild LocationThe price spent for a rebuild in the country is going to be far less than one done in a major city. Additionally, you need to think about the type of shop you visit.If your cousin?s friend is rebuilding the engine, you will spend less than if you go to a dedicated engine shop. Considering an engine rebuild will take anywhere from ten to twenty hours, the big grunt of the bill is spent on labor. Even a $25 an hour difference can quickly add up, but are you willing to trade the expertise for a lower price?"
what are the Signs it?s Time for Engine Rebuild  ?	"1. Rattling/KnockingWhen the engine starts making knocking or rattling sounds, you know there is serious trouble ahead. Both of these sounds indicate some major problems. Listen closely to the engine while it is idling. If you hear the noises faintly, you might still be able to repair the problem. However, letting the situation get worse only spells trouble. If the bearings wear or an internal component breaks, a rebuild might be necessary.RELATED: 7 Engine Noises You Should Not Ignore (& What They Mean)2. ClatteringAre you hearing a clattering sound when you step on the accelerator? The pistons could be moving too much inside the cylinders. The mechanic refers to this condition as Piston Slap. If you get it repaired right away, you might be able to avoid an engine rebuild, but you don?t want to wait.However, this sound can also happen if the timing belt or chain breaks. Have the engine inspected at the first sign of trouble to reduce your repair costs. 3. Coolant/Oil MixingThere?s never a reason to see coolant in the oil or vice versa. If they are mixing, there?s an internal malfunction that must be dealt with.In most cases, seeing a mixture of the two indicates that the head gasket has blown. However, it can also point to a damaged cylinder and an engine block crack. All three will require serious engine repair. Still, there are times when fixing a blown head gasket won?t require rebuilding the entire engine. Either way, it can be quite expensive to deal with. 4. Seized EngineIf the engine won?t turn over, your first thought shouldn?t be that the engine has seized. Instead, you should be thinking about replacing the battery or checking for ignition system faults. However, it could be a seized engine, especially if you haven?t been taking care of it.When you try to start a car with a seized engine, nothing is going to happen. However, all of the electronics will operate normally. Instead, the starter is going to simply click when the key is turned. You might also smell a burning smell from the motor. 5. Thick Exhaust SmokeSometimes, the first sign that there is oil entering the combustion chambers or coolant infiltrating the oil is a thick smoke coming from the tailpipe. If the smoke is blue, you are dealing with infiltrating oil, while white smoke indicates coolant is going where it shouldn?t. Most likely, the head gasket has blown or you have a cracked engine block. Either way, you are looking at a hefty engine repair bill. "
differences Rebuild and Replace Engine  ?	"It might seem more appealing to put a new car engine into your vehicle. After all, the engine replacement is going to have all new parts and a factory warranty. The engine will also operate just like it did when your car was new, giving it plenty more life. With a brand-new engine, you should expect to pay more. You will spend the higher end of a rebuilt engine, if not more. Some engines that are more powerful can exceed $10,000, which might be more than your vehicle is even worth. On the other hand, a rebuilt engine is completely overhauled to ensure a longer lifespan. It?s been taken apart and inspected for damage. Anything that?s defective is refinished, repaired or replaced with new components. It?s the same as a new engine, in part. It takes some expertise to rebuild an engine. You won?t be able to take your vehicle to just any garage. You also have to trust the mechanic that?s working on it. After all, you don?t want to spend a ton of money and have the engine fail because it wasn?t done properly. A remanufactured engine is also an option. While it?s not new, everything inside has been replaced, so it operates in factory condition. These can cost more than a rebuilt engine, but are more cost-effective than a new factory engine."
How is an Engine Rebuilt? 	"A rebuilt engine requires that all defective parts are removed and replaced. The process looks different on each engine, depending on what the problem is. In general, these are the steps the technician will take.The engine is removed from the vehicle.The engine is disassembled, so all of the parts can be seen.The mechanic inspects every part. If it can be cleaned and reinstalled, that is done. However, there will be some parts that must be replaced. For starters, mechanics replace old valve springs, oil pumps, bearings, chains, timing belts, seals and old rings in the majority of engine rebuilds. Depending on the level of damage, the mechanic may also need to replace the crankshaft or camshafts. It?s also possible that the engine block needs to be realigned with the crankshaft main bores. Ask the mechanic how the engine rebuild is done at their shop before you commit to having any work done. It?s important that you feel comfortable with the work that will be performed."
What?s The Difference Between The LS3 and LS7 Engines?	"Among the top differences between LS3 and LS7, the two engines feature a varying amount of performance, with the LS7 providing more horsepower. Additionally, the LS7 seems to be more reliable than the LS3, but it comes at a higher cost. Both engines have also had issues, although they are different.Here is a more detailed list of the differences between a LS3 and LS7 engine:1. Years of ProductionBoth the LS3 and LS7 engines are part of the 4th generation of motors from GM. While they both belong to the same generation, the motors were offered in varying years.The LS7 is the older model of the two. It was produced from 2006 to 2015. The LS3 was built from 2008 to 2017. You can purchase either of these engines as a remanufactured option. 2. Displacement/SizeThe LS3 engine has a displacement measuring 6162cc or 376.0 cubic inches. It?s designed to fit the Chevy Corvette, Camaro SS and G8 GXP. LS7 engines contain a 7008 cc or 427.6 cubic inch displacement. It?s meant to fit the Corvette Z06 and Camaro Z28. The LS3 contains a 103.25 mm cylinder bore size, while the LS7 is measured at 104.8 mm. Plus, the LS3 piston stroke size is 92 mm bore, while the LS7 is measured at 101.6 mm. While the larger piston stroke size might cause some issues, such as increased friction and more crankshaft stress, it can last longer overall. 3. Power/Torque OutputThe LS3 motor will pump out 426 to 436 horsepower at 5900 RPM, while the LS7 is rated at 505 horsepower at 6300 RPM. For this reason, the LS7 is most often chosen by builders looking for a racing engine.Additionally, the LS7 features more torque, rated at 470 lb-ft at 4800 RPM, while the LS3 offers 420-428 lb-ft at 4600 RPM. With either engine, you are sure to get a high-performance option. 4. Compression RatioThe LS3 compression ratio is 10.7:1. In comparison, the LS7 motor provides a compression rating of 11.0:1.If you are looking for a fuel-efficient engine, you want the higher compression ratio. The higher the rating is, the more energy that?s generated during the combustion process, allowing a better temperature without as much fuel. 5. MaterialBoth engines have cylinder heads and a block that?s created from cast aluminum. This material ensures that the block remains lightweight. On the downside, it can?t provide as much durability as the cast iron engine.However, the cast aluminum also allows for higher thermal conductivity. Engine cooling happens faster and it remains efficient. 6. Fuel SystemBoth the LS3 and LS7 motors provide sequential fuel injection systems. The fuel is provided to the engine through injectors that fire individually. Because these aren?t multiport systems, it remains more efficient. LS7 engines must use premium fuel featuring a 91 or higher octane level. While this is also recommended for the LS3 engine, you don?t have to use premium fuel. You can also choose to use the regular or mid-grade option too. 7. ReliabilityThe LS7 engine offers a slight advantage because of the performance level. Still, it?s not immune from trouble. In fact, there have been reports of cavitation in the oil system. There have also been complaints of the exhaust valves getting separated from the stem. Thankfully, it?s not difficult to upgrade the engine to repair these problems. On the other hand, the LS3 seems to come with more issues. Faulty rings seem to be the most complained about. If it doesn?t get resolved, you could deal with more oil consumption. Additionally, the LS3 engine tends to wear out quicker as the mileage begins to rack up. You may see valve and lifter issues sooner than with the LS7. The smaller, compact size also makes it more difficult to maintain. The replaceable parts and lifters are difficult to access. 8. CostTo get a 6.2-liter LS3 GM engine, you might spend around $6,500. On the other hand, the LS7 costs almost double. You could easily spend more than $12,000.Of course, these costs are merely estimates. The price is different depending on where you purchase the engine from and what vehicle you are putting it into. If you purchase your own engine, you?ll likely spend less than if you purchase it through the local auto repair shop. "
What is A LS3 Engine? 	"The LS3 motor is a 4th generation small block GM engine. It was first created in 2008 and placed in Corvettes. It?s now one of the most popular remanufactured engine options for Chevy supercars because of how well it performs. The LS3 features a 6.2-liter displacement and contains a sequential fuel injection system. When it first debuted, it offered 430 horsepower and 424 lb-ft. of torque. Now, you can find some that have been tweaked to provide 436 horsepower. This V8 engine contains high-flow cylinder heads to ensure adequate airflow. Plus, it is built with a high-flow intake manifold to match those cylinder heads. The 58X ignition unit keeps all of the timing accurate, plus the motor is built with a crankshaft ring and sensor, so there?s always an accurate crankshaft position reading. "
What is A LS7 Engine?	"The performance of the LS7 engine is legendary. It?s a GM engine that was released in 2006, before the LS3. Because it is built from aluminum and cast steel, it contains a light block but offers superior durability. Since its release, the engine pumps out 505 horsepower and contains 474 lb-ft of torque. The race-derived cylinder heads provide maximum airflow. It also contains computer-controlled exhaust and intake outlets, along with 70cc combustion chambers. All airflow restrictions are removed, so there?s beautiful power coming from the naturally aspirated engine. This engine has a high-flow intake manifold that works with the motor?s cylinder heads. Plus, an acoustic shell and foam have been added to the intake manifold to muffle any unwanted noises. Because of the dry-sump system, oil consumption is ideal, allowing for perfect amounts of lubrication, even in higher RPM situations. "

"Which Is Better, LS3 and LS7?"	"If you are in need of a low-cost, high-performance engine for your build, the LS3 will probably provide everything you are looking for. With 430 horsepower, you won?t be disappointed in the level of performance by any means.However, if you have more money and desire more, we highly recommend the LS7 engine. You can easily tweak the engine to provide about 570 horsepower, causing it to provide more punch than the LS3. Still, you need to put aside much more money if you want to equip your car with this GM engine."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Canister Purge Valve ?	"The most common symptom of a bad canister purge valve is a check engine light on your dashboard. In most cases, you will not notice any other symptoms, but in rare cases, you may notice signs such as increased emissions or poor engine performance.While the vapor canister purge valve solenoid is an emissions component, that doesn?t mean you won?t notice a few performance issues if you don?t fix it right away.Below is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing canister purge valve to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightThe most common thing you?ll notice from a bad vapor canister purge valve is that you?ll get a check engine light that you weren?t expecting. While the symptoms can change depending on whether or not the valve is stuck open or closed, one thing that shouldn?t change is that you should get a check engine light.2. Increased EmissionsCar Emission Test E1609793156790If the vapor canister purge valve is stuck closed instead of open, the valve won?t push any fuel vapors back into the engine. Instead, they?ll run straight out of the exhaust, which will cause much higher emission levels.Of course, you probably won?t notice this unless you take your vehicle in for an emission test.3. Poor Engine PerformanceSlow Car AccelerationWhen the vapor canister purge valve is stuck open, you?re getting more air in the system than your vehicle expects. That means every time you hit the throttle; your vehicle isn?t dropping enough fuel in the engine for the amount of fuel there.While these effects will be more noticeable at lower RPMs, they can affect performance across all engine speeds; it just isn?t as noticeable.4. Difficult to StartCar Dont StartThe vapor canister purge valve does a lot of its work when you?re starting up your vehicle to empty the fuel tank of gases, so it makes sense that this would be when you notice most of the symptoms.If the purge valve is stuck open, you?re going to have an excess amount of air when you go to start the engine, and since your vehicle isn?t accounting for this, it?s going to throw off the fuel to air ratio.While your vehicle should still start, you?re going to notice that it takes a bit more work to get there. It is pretty rare that it will not start at all because of this valve, though.5. Rough IdleLow Idle RpmVapor canister purge valves run off of vacuum, and if you have a vacuum leak, it can affect engine performance, especially at lower engine speeds.The result of a vacuum leak on a canister purge valve would be a rougher than usual idle. The size of the leak would affect how significant of an issue this is."
Vapor Canister Purge Valve Function ?	"Unless you?re a mechanic or an engineer, you?ve probably never heard of a canister purge valve before. To begin with, it?s an emissions component that redirects excess fuel vapors back into the engine.The entire system that it?s a part of is your vehicle?s EVAP (Evaporative Emission) system. It works in conjunction with the charcoal canister to capture and redirect excess fuel vapors so the engine can burn them again.This reduces your emissions by burning the fuel vapors instead of letting them out into the atmospher via the car?s exhaust, essentially maximizing the amount of energy produced and minimizing the number of harmful chemicals released as a byproduct.Because it?s effective at reducing the overall amount of harmful emissions, many auto manufacturers have started to implement them into new vehicles to meet rising emission standards.But when the vapor canister purge valve gets stuck open, you get too much air in the system, and that wrecks performance. On the other hand, if it gets stuck closed, your emission levels skyrocket."
Vapor Canister Purge Valve Location ?	"Depending on what you drive, there are two typical locations for the vapor canister purge valve.The canister purge control valve is most often located in the engine bay on a hose going from the intake to the canister. It can also be located near the fuel tank.The component won?t look like much. Typically, it?s nothing more than a little black plastic component with an electrical connector and a vacuum line on each end. While it can be hard to identify, it?s usually pretty easy to access once you?ve found it."
Vapor Canister Purge Valve Replacement Cost ?	"The average vapor canister purge valve replacement cost is between $50 and $300, depending on the car model and labor costs.While those little plastic components might not look like much, they?re not cheap to replace. The part alone usually costs between $30 and $150. From there, you have to factor in labor rates too.This cost can vary depending on the vapor canister purge valve?s location and how hard it is to reach, but the cost usually ranges between $20 and $150.If you are looking to do the work yourself, it?s pretty straightforward to replace a vapor canister purge valve that?s in the engine bay. All you need to do is locate the valve and potentially remove an intake cover to finish the job.If the valve is attached to the fuel tank?s rear, you?ll likely need to jack up the rear end of the vehicle and remove the tire to gain access to the area. While this isn?t a ton of work if you have the proper equipment, it certainly can slow down the process a bit.But considering that these simple steps can save you between $50 and $150, it?s typically well worth the few extra steps! Just remember to reset the engine code by disconnecting and reconnecting the battery to finish the job!"
Can I drive with a faulty purge valve?	"Yes. In most cases, you will not notice any severe performance issues when your purge control valve is bad, and you can drive the car to a repair shop. However, it?s not recommended that you keep driving with a faulty purge valve without fixing it. If the purge valve is not working properly, it can cause emissions to escape from the tank, and this can be harmful to both the environment and your car?s performance."
Can I replace a purge valve myself?	"Replacing a purge control valve is fairly straightforward on most car models, though it can be difficult on a few. In most cases, you can replace it with some basic knowledge and a repair manual, but if you are not confident in your abilities, it is always best to leave it to the professionals."
How long does it take to fix an EVAP purge valve?	"Replacing a purge control valve is generally a pretty quick and easy process that most car owners can do themselves. The entire job should take no more than about 30 minutes, and in many cases, it can be done in 15 minutes or less."
Can a purge valve be cleaned?	"It is possible to clean a purge control valve, but it is not always necessary. If the vent valve is clogged, cleaning it can definitely help. But in most cases there is an electrical problem in the purge control valve, and in that case, cleaning won?t help."
Conclusion	"Because the symptoms of a bad canister purge valve are similar to the symptoms of other car problems, it can be difficult to diagnose the problem yourself without the right tools. The first thing you should do when you suspect that the purge valve is bad is to read the codes with a diagnostic scanner.If your check engine light is on, or if you?re experiencing any of the other symptoms we?ve listed but don?t feel you have the knowledge or tools to diagnose it, take your car to a mechanic for a diagnosis.It is still important to get this problem fixed as soon as possible, even if the purge valve itself isn?t a big issue, as it can lead to more serious problems down the road if left untreated. We hope this post has helped you better understand the symptoms of a bad canister purge control valve!"
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Fuel Pump ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad fuel pump are engine hiccups, misfires, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and a stalling engine. You may also notice an illuminated check engine light on your dashboard.This may give you some fast answers, but you do probably want to know more about the issues. Luckily, here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing fuel pump to look for:1. Car Experiences HiccupsCar Hiccups E1609774936535Cars need fuel to drive, just as we humans need food. It is easy to understand how important fuel is, and it is also easy to see that your car will not meet your expectations if the correct fuel supply is not guaranteed.If you press the accelerator and feel that your car has hiccups, you may have problems with the fuel pump.The fuel pump may be choking due to inferior fuel, or the fuel pump may not be generating enough pressure to push the fuel forward into the system.2. MisfiresCar Misfires E1609774947173An insufficient supply of fuel to the combustion chamber will not create enough chamber excitement to cause an explosion. No combustion means that the engine will not start at all. Even if it does, you will find that it takes you a long time to reach ignition.If you experience that your car has misfires or sounds like a tractor at idle, you might have low fuel pressure due to the fuel pump.3. Sudden Engine Shutdown or no starting conditionStranded Car E1609774958505The engine needs fuel to run, and if the fuel pump is bad, the engine won?t get any fuel. If your engine doesn?t start at all or having sudden engine shutdowns while driving, there might be a problem with the fuel pump.If this occurs regularly, it is time to arrange a meeting with your local mechanic.4. BackfiresBackfire E1609774966542Since a bad fuel pump can give an intermittent amount of fuel to the engine, you can experience misfires because of the too low fuel amount.The engine can also get too much fuel, resulting in unburned fuel in the exhaust pipe, which will cause backfires from the exhaust pipe.5. Check Engine Light IlluminatesCheck Engine LightFortunately, modern cars are loaded with sensors that can detect any number of problems as soon as they occur. One of these sensors is a fuel pressure sensor that is intelligently measuring the fuel pressure. If an irregularity is detected, the sensor sends a signal to the ECU, which lights up the check engine light.You can easily check the error code displayed by the Check Engine Light through an OBD2 ScannerIr?T=Askamastermec 20&Amp;L=Am2&Amp;O=1&Amp;A=B01Mr7Fzs1.6. Thick Black or white Smoke from ExhaustBlack Smoke CarVehicles do not normally emit black smoke from their exhaust unless they are powered by diesel fuel. If your gasoline-powered car emits such smoke, there is usually engine damage.One of the causes of black or white smoke is a defective fuel pump, making your engine get a rich fuel mixture. In most cases, a bad fuel pump is giving a lean mixture, so this is not a very common one.7. Turbocharger UnderperformsTurbochargerFirst of all, not all cars have a turbocharger, but those with one have a bonus symptom. Turbochargers work by compressing airs to rotate a turbine that delivers additional power to the engine.Turbos need time to spool air; this time is usually called turbo lag. So if you feel that there is a lot of turbo lag, your fuel pump could be a problem.8. Spark Plugs Will Die SoonerBad Spark PlugssFuel does actually cool down internal engine parts. With a too lean air-fuel mixture, you can actually make your spark plugs getting too hot. A defective fuel pump interferes with the internal workings of the engine.The smallest damage occurs in the cylinder itself, and the smallest components take the greatest damage. This means the spark plugs may die before their time.So if you feel that your spark plugs need to be replaced too soon, you may be dealing with a faulty fuel pump."
What is a Fuel Pump?	"The fuel pump?s main function is to deliver fuel to the fuel injectors, injecting fuel into the combustion engine system. In most cases, carburetor engines use the function of mechanical fuel pumps, which are mounted outside the fuel tank and operate under low-pressure conditions.Apart from carburetor engines, diesel engines often use two main pumps to deliver fuel, which works electrically and improves performance efficiency.One pump is installed inside the fuel tank, which delivers more fuel at low pressure, while another pump is installed near or inside the engine, which sucks in the required amount of fuel at a higher pressure.For the maximum efficiency and proper functioning, the fuel pump operates under certain conditions that are electronically adjusted to optimize the combustion engine?s air-fuel mixture. If more fuel is supplied to the engine, the air-fuel ratio is disturbed, and all the fuel cannot burn efficiently."
where the Fuel Pump Location ?	"The fuel pump is almost always located at the top and inside the fuel tank on newer cars. Some cars have a cover to remove under the backseat or in the trunk to reach the fuel pump?s location.Unfortunately, you have to remove or lower the fuel tank to reach it for some cars.Some older cars do also have an external fuel pump located outside of the tank."
how to Test A Fuel Pump ?	"Testing the fuel pump can help diagnose problems with a vehicle's fuel system, such as a lack of fuel pressure or fuel delivery. Here are the steps to test a fuel pump:Locate the fuel pump: The fuel pump is typically located inside the fuel tank.Test the fuel pressure: Use a fuel pressure gauge to test the fuel pressure. Connect the gauge to the fuel rail or fuel line and turn the ignition on. The fuel pressure should be within the specifications provided by the vehicle manufacturer. If the fuel pressure is low, it may indicate a problem with the fuel pump.Check the fuel pump relay: The fuel pump relay controls power to the fuel pump. Use a multimeter to check the voltage at the relay. If there is no voltage, the relay may be faulty.Check the fuel pump fuse: The fuel pump fuse protects the fuel pump from electrical overload. Use a multimeter to check the continuity of the fuse. If the fuse is blown, it will need to be replaced.Listen for the fuel pump: When the ignition is turned on, the fuel pump should make a buzzing or humming sound for a few seconds. If there is no sound, the fuel pump may be faulty.Check for fuel delivery: Disconnect the fuel line from the fuel rail or carburetor and turn the ignition on. Fuel should flow freely from the fuel line. If there is no fuel delivery, the fuel pump may be faulty.Check the fuel pump strainer: The fuel pump strainer filters out debris from the fuel tank. Remove the fuel pump and check the strainer for any signs of clogging or damage.If any of these tests indicate a faulty fuel pump, it may need to be replaced. It is important to have a professional mechanic diagnose and repair the problem to ensure proper functioning of the vehicle and to prevent further damage to the engine or fuel system."
How Much Does A Fuel Pump Replacement Cost?	"The average fuel pump replacement cost is between $100 and $700, depending on the car model and labor costs. A fuel pump costs $50 to $400, and the labor cost is $50 to $300.If you have a petrol engine with an electronic fuel pump, the fuel pump is often not very expensive. The expensive part is letting a mechanic replace the pump. The pump is often located inside the fuel tank, which means that there is a cover to reach it from under the back seat if you are lucky. But, there are car models you have to remove the whole fuel tank to reach it. You can imagine the time it takes.In some cases, you can do it yourself if you have some experience, but remember it is a really nasty job and not good for your health.If you have a diesel engine and want to replace the mechanical fuel pump, you can expect a much higher replacement cost. These pumps can cost up to $1500 if you are unlucky, and the replacement cost is often also very high. After this, you do often need an adjustment of these pumps also."
What Are The Causes of Blue Smoke from the Exhaust?	"Blue smoke from the exhaust means that the engine oil is mixing with gasoline in the combustion cycle. It can also be caused by oil dripping onto hot engine parts. In some cases, blue exhaust smoke is a sign that a part has failed, such as the turbocharger or PCV valve. When blue smoke is present, it means that oil is burning up and coming out of the exhaust pipe with the burned fuel. Whatever is causing it, the vehicle is operating inefficiently and should be repaired. Here is a more detailed list of the causes of blue smoke from the exhaust:1. Oil in the combustion chamberCombustion CarAs the engine ages, piston rings, valve seals and other vital components start to wear out. Wear occurs faster if you fail to perform regular oil changes because contaminated oil is less effective at reducing friction. If the valve seals become cracked and brittle, it is less likely to keep the fluids separate. That?s when oil starts to mix with the fuel in the combustion chamber.Blue smoke coming from the exhaust often indicates that there is oil in the combustion chamber. Sometimes, this is caused by worn-out piston rings, which means you may need to replace the engine. RELATED: Black Smoke From Exhaust ? Causes & How to Fix it2. Blown TurbochargerTurbochargerIf the turbo has blown out, there is a possibility for blue smoke out of the exhaust. A blown turbo can mean one that is damaged, but it also could be caused by a leaking oil seal.In either situation, oil seeps into the engine. Once the oil has infiltrated the engine, it mixes with fuel to create blue smoke. 3. Piston Ring DamagePiston Ring FunctionPiston rings are created to keep the engine oil where it belongs in the combustion chamber. When they fail, the oil can flow into the wrong area. As the oil mixes with the fuel, it can create blue smoke. Sadly, replacing piston rings can become very expensive. RELATED: 4 Symptoms of a Bad Piston Ring4. Dripping OilExhaust ManifoldIf something is wrong with the vehicle and hot oil is escaping out of the engine, it?s possible that it is making contact with hot parts under the hood. As you accelerate, you might notice blue smoke coming from the back of the car because of the oil hitting the engine block. While this isn?t actually coming from the exhaust, it might look like it is.Oil can drop from a blown gasket in the engine block. When it seeps through, it makes its way onto the hot exhaust, leading to blue smoke. Additionally, it could leak onto the headers, also causing blue smoke. If the smoke is coming from under the hood when you aren?t driving, it?s a telltale sign that oil is leaking. Sadly, when the head gasket is leaking, you may also need to have a cylinder head replaced. 5. Stuck PCV ValvePcv ValveThe Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) Valve can also cause blue smoke from the exhaust. This valve is responsible for releasing the pressure that builds up in the oil pan. Pressure is routed into the intake manifold, so fumes can be reburned.When the PCV valve is stuck, oil mixes with air and other gases. Because the intake manifold is also connected to the air filter, it can lead to blue smoke."
How to Fix Blue Smoke from Exhaust ?	"1. Remove Excess OilThe simplest fix is to remove some oil from the system. This fix only works if the blue smoke occurred directly after performing an oil change.It?s possible that there?s too much oil in the system. This condition causes aeration and pressure, making it harder for the engine to properly deal with the heat and friction. To resolve this issue, just remove enough of the oil that the levels are correct. 2. Clean EngineIf the engine hasn?t been cleaned in a while, it?s time to take a look at it. When dirt gets stuck in the engine, it can clog the oil return holes in the cylinder head, causing a leak. Remove the valve cover and clean off any debris that you see. You also want to clean out the drain back holes. Wipe down the engine to ensure there is no oil left behind that could cause blue smoke.As you clean off the engine, it?s a good time to inspect it. If you notice an area where oil might be leaking, fix the problem immediately. 3. Replace Piston RingsDamaged piston rings can create blue smoke, but this isn?t a problem that?s easy to deal with. While the piston rings might only cost about $50 each, the labor is what causes the bill to get so hefty.The engine must be removed and disassembled to get to the rings. Expect to pay $1,000 or more for the entire job to be completed. 4. Fix TurbochargerIf the turbocharger is blown, you must stop driving immediately. Driving a car with a blown turbo can lead to much bigger problems. In fact, metal bits can form because there is no lubrication in the turbocharger. This metal can make its way into the engine, leading to permanent damage. 5. Replace PCV ValveIt doesn?t cost a lot to replace the PCV valve. Plus, the job is straightforward. Identify the tube that is connected from the intake manifold to the valve cover and follow it until you find the PCV valve.Take off the valve and replace it with a new one. As long as you put the new valve in the right spot, everything will work as it should, hopefully fixing the blue smoke condition.6. Repair Valve SealsUnless you have some mechanical knowledge, you don?t want to try fixing the valve seals on your own. You will need some special tools and a little finesse to get the job done right.To replace the valve seals, you must take out the spring from the rocker arm and valve. Lift the valve seal up and replace it with a new one. Whatever you do, don?t drop the valve into the engine, or you will have bigger problems on your hands. "
Driving with Blue Smoke from the Exhaust ?	"In some cases, it?s okay to continue driving with blue smoke coming out of the exhaust. However, you want to make sure you know what the problem is before you make it worse. If the turbocharger is blown or oil is mixing with the fuel, you want to stop driving and have the issue fixed.Letting problems continue only leads to more expenses later. If you need to replace an engine because of damage, the cost might be $3,000 or more, which is something you don?t want to deal with."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad MAP Sensor ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad MAP sensor are bad fuel consumption and a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice signs like a misfiring or stalling engine. Rough idle or difficulty starting are also common.Any problem with the manifold absolute pressure sensor (MAP) will result in improper combustion, damaging the engine and disrupting its performance.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing MAP sensor you should look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightThe engine control unit constantly monitors all the sensors in your car engine while you drive the car. If one of these sensors? values is out of the specified range, the check engine light will show up.Therefore, if your MAP sensor sends wrong information to the engine control unit, the check engine light will appear on your dashboard.2. Lean Air-fuel MixtureSpark Plug MisfiresThe MAP sensor?s primary purpose is to measure the air pressure in the intake manifold to calculate the right air-fuel mixture for your engine. If the sensor is bad, it may cause your engine to get a too lean air-fuel mixture.Lean fuel mixture can cause many strange symptoms in your engine, which you will find further down in this list.3. Rich Air-fuel MixtureCar Rich Mixture E1609804774815The same thing applies the other way around as well. If the MAP sensor is bad, it can also send a faulty signal, which will cause the engine control unit to inject too much fuel into the car engine.A rich air-fuel mixture will not only cause your fuel consumption to go up, but it will also cause performance problems.4. Stalling or Rough IdleCar Engine Rough IdleIf your air-fuel mixture is too rich or too lean, caused by a faulty MAP sensor, you may notice problems at the engine?s idle. When the engine is running at idle, it is very sensitive, and therefore you may first notice a faulty air-fuel mixture at idle.Many other faulty parts can also cause this, so it should be diagnosed properly before you replace the MAP sensor.5. MisfiresCar MisfiresMisfires occur when the combustion inside the engine cylinder fails. This can happen due to a wrong air-fuel mixture or a bad spark. A MAP sensor may actually cause the air-fuel mixture to become so bad that you may notice misfires.You can often recognize misfires by listening to your engine. If you can hear small bumps or if it doesn?t sound like it usually sounds, it may be caused by misfires.6. Increased Emission LevelCars Emission Test E1609865644244If the manifold absolute pressure sensor (MAP) is damaged, it can send an incorrect signal to the powertrain control module (PCM), indicating a high or low engine load.To have a good emission level in your car, the air-fuel mixture needs to be perfect. Even a slight error with the MAP sensor may cause the fuel mixture to disturb the emission levels.7. Bad Engine PerformanceSlow Car AccelerationAs I mentioned earlier, a faulty fuel mixture will cause the engine performance to drop. A lean mixture usually causes decreased engine performance, but it can absolutely be caused by a too rich mixture as well.Bad engine performance can also be caused by misfires caused by a bad MAP sensor, as discussed earlier in the article.8. BackfiresBackfireBackfires happen when the fuel going through your engine is not combusted properly. When the fuel is not ignited in the combustion chamber, it may end up in the exhaust pipe. As you may suspect, the exhaust pipe becomes really hot, and this can ignite the air-fuel mixture there.This will cause loud bangs coming from the exhaust system, and this can actually cause your mufflers, etc., to explode. It can also cause your car to catch on fire if you are unlucky.9. Hard Starting ConditionStarting CarA faulty MAP sensor also causes problems when starting the car. The car?s trip computer uses the MAP sensor to determine the air pressure before starting the engine.The engine is very sensitive to having the right air-fuel mixture at the starting moment, and therefore, a faulty reading can cause too little fuel to be delivered to the engine. As a result, the engine may not start at all.10. Changed fuel consumptionFuel ConsumptionThis is most probably the most understandable if you read everything above in the article. A faulty air-fuel mixture caused by a bad MAP sensor will, of course, also cause the fuel consumption to change.If you notice that your car requires less or more fuel than before, it can absolutely be caused by a faulty MAP sensor."
where the MAP sensor location ?	"The MAP sensor is located on the intake manifold on most car models. It can also be installed on the car?s body on a vacuum hose going from the intake manifold.The position of the MAP sensor depends on your car?s design, and it is recommended that you check the exact position of the MAP sensor in your car in the service manual."
what is the MAP Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"The average MAP sensor replacement cost is between $60 and $170, depending on the car model and labor costs. Labor costs between $30 and $70, while the sensor itself costs between $30 and $100,The MAP sensor replacement is often relatively easy, and this is something you can do yourself at home on most car models. If you have a little bit of car knowledge, you can easily save some money by doing it yourself."
Diagnosing a Bad MAP sensor ?	"Diagnosis of a faulty or failing MAP sensor can be made by first observing the present symptoms in your vehicle and then conducting a physical test as a diagnostic procedure.The easiest way to test the MAP sensor is to connect a Diagnostic scanner to check the value of the MAP sensor. When the engine is switched off but the ignition on, you should get a reading of close to 1 bar or 14.5 psi.Check this video for the procedure of testing a MAP sensor: MAP sensor testing.Here is a brief step-by-step guide that you can follow to check, test, and diagnose if the MAP sensor in your vehicle has gone wrong.Locate the MAP sensor of your engine by checking yourself or referring to the service manual of your vehicleEnsure that the vacuum hose attached to the MAP sensor is connected correctly and is in excellent condition.Check to see if the connections and the electrical wires are in good condition.Clean the sensor with an electronic cleaner and recheck the values with your diagnostic scanner.Test the MAP sensor after these instructions.Measure the wirings between the engine control unit and the MAP sensor.Replace the MAP sensor if faulty, otherwise repair wirings."
Can I drive my car with a bad map sensor?	"A bad map sensor causes the air-fuel mixture to get too lean or too rich. This can cause your engine to have performance problems, so it is not recommended to drive with a bad map sensor. If your car is running fine, you can drive slowly to the closest repair workshop."
How can I tell if a map sensor is bad?	"You will mostly notice a bad MAP sensor by seeing a check engine light on your dashboard. By using a diagnostic tool, you can check the values the MAP sensor sends to the ECU to determine if it is bad or not."
How much does it cost to fix a map sensor?	"The MAP sensor itself is often relatively cheap, and you can usually replace it yourself at home. The cost of the sensor is 30-70$, and the labor work 30-100$."
Can a map sensor be cleaned?	"Yes. There will often be soot and other debris on the MAP sensor?s measure head over time. This can usually be cleaned with an electrical cleaner. Be careful that you do not damage the sensor. In some cases, you have to replace the sensor."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad or Leaking Valve Cover Gasket ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad valve cover gasket are external oil leaks and a low engine oil level when you check the dipstick. You may also notice a burning smell after acceleration. In some cars, it can also result in a misfiring engine or a check engine light.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or leaking valve cover gasket to look for:1. Oil LeaksCar Oil LeakWhenever you see oil leaking out under your vehicle, it becomes alarming. However, oil leaks are caused by many issues, so it?s not a tell-tale sign of a failed valve cover gasket alone.Still, if you notice oil leaking from the valve cover area, you can assume that the gasket has gone bad. Inspect the area around the gasket to see if any oil is seeping out.Initially, the oil leakage will be minimal, getting worse as time goes on. After some time, it could even coat the valve cover surface, causing a thick layer of dirt to also accumulate on the valve cover. If you allow the oil to continue leaking, you risk more extensive engine repairs down the road. Plus, this symptom puts additional wear on the belts and hoses as the oil softens the rubber on the belts and hoses, eventually causing premature failure.. 2. Low Oil Check Oil Level (2)It?s vital to check your engine?s oil levels regularly. When the oil gets too low, it?s often a sign of a problem, especially when it occurs frequently.The engine operates as a sealed system, so oil shouldn?t be disappearing unless something is wrong. Start by checking the valve cover for signs of leaking. While you wait for a valve cover gasket repair, make sure you keep topping off the oil. Running the engine without the proper amount of lubrication can cause the engine to cease and fail. 3. Burning SmellCar Smells Burning RubberThe smell of burning oil should always cause alarm. As the oil leaks out of the valve cover, it can easily drip onto your car?s hot engine and exhaust. What you are left with is the undeniable smell of burning oil.This odor becomes overpowering when you pop the hood, even if you can?t see the oil burning. Whenever you smell burning oil, you should assume that there is a risk of a car fire and stop driving immediately. 4. Misfiring EngineCar Misfire Spark PlugsWhen the car engine misfires, there are many causes that contribute to poor performance. One of the most common reasons for misfiring is a defective spark plug or issue in the fuel system. However, you shouldn?t overlook the possibility of a bad valve cover gasket.The valve cover sits above the spark plugs. When the gasket fails and allows oil to leak onto the car?s spark plugs, fluid can get into the openings. As oil builds up, the spark plugs cannot work properly and foul out.This causes the spark plug to fail, reducing the ignition of the air and fuel mixture. What you are left with is a misfiring engine that creates a rough ride. It can also lead to an engine fire when not dealt with immediately.5. Dashboard Indicator LightsOil Level Low LightSome people rely on the dashboard warnings to tell them when something is wrong. If you haven?t been checking the oil, this might be your first indication of a problem. The Oil Warning Light might alert you to low pressure or a lack of lubrication in the engine. You might also see the Check Engine Light when there is a valve cover gasket defect. Either one of these indicators is telling you that there is a critical issue that should be addressed immediately. "
what is the Valve Cover Gasket Function ?	"The engine?s valve cover is designed to protect the components of your car?s motor. Not only does it keep the elements out of the engine, but it prevents damage to the expensive machinery.The valve cover is sealed with the help of the valve cover gasket. While it is only a thin strip of rubber placed between the valve cover and the engine, the gasket has a significant role. Without it, oil can seep out of the system, leading to engine damage.Over time, this gasket becomes brittle and cracks. This can be caused by old age or just from the excessive heat in the engine. "
where the Valve Cover Gasket Location ?	"The valve cover gasket is located between the motor and the valve cover. You will find the valve cover sitting on top of the motor. It?s the hard cover protecting the valves and engine components. The gasket is used to create a tight seal between the engine and the valve cover. Often, this part fails due to old age and requires replacement. To replace the valve cover gasket, you must remove the valve cover as well. "
Diagnosing A Leaking Valve Cover Gasket ?	"A leaking valve cover gasket is a common problem in older cars, and it can lead to oil leaking onto the engine, which can cause problems. Here are the steps to diagnose a leaking valve cover gasket:Look for oil on the engine: If you notice oil on the engine, it may be a sign that the valve cover gasket is leaking. Look for oil on the valve cover, engine block, and other areas around the engine.Check the oil level: Check the oil level in your car's engine using the dipstick. If the oil level is low, it may indicate that oil is leaking from the engine, and the valve cover gasket is a common source of leaks.Inspect the valve cover: Remove the valve cover from the engine and inspect it for cracks, damage, or signs of wear. If the valve cover is damaged or worn, it may need to be replaced.Check the gasket: Remove the valve cover gasket and inspect it for signs of wear, cracking, or damage. If the gasket is worn, it may need to be replaced.Clean the valve cover and gasket: Before installing a new valve cover gasket, clean the valve cover and gasket surfaces thoroughly to ensure a good seal.Install a new gasket: Install a new valve cover gasket, making sure that it is seated properly and tightened to the correct torque specification.Test for leaks: Once the new gasket is installed, start the engine and check for leaks. If there are no leaks, the repair is complete.If you are not comfortable diagnosing or repairing a leaking valve cover gasket, it is best to take your car to a qualified mechanic."
what is the Valve Cover Gasket Replacement Cost ?	"Expect the valve cover gasket replacement cost to be between $90 and $400, depending on what type of vehicle you drive. You will find new valve cover gaskets for $40 to $50, with the majority of the cost spent on labor. To replace the valve cover gasket, labor could be $50 to $350. Thankfully, it?s often just the gasket that needs to be replaced and not the valve cover. However, if this part also needs to be replaced, it can be done with minimal effort at the same time you swap out the gasket since both parts are removed at the same time. The only additional charge would be for the valve cover itself. "
what is The Best Cylinder Car Engines ?	"1. AUDI S3 2.0-Liter 4-Cylinder EnginesAudi S3 2.0 Litre 4 Cylinder EnginesIt is a bitter reality that Audi, as a subsidiary of the German car manufacturer VW, uses VW engines, and that they do not have a specific engine family name like Mazda or Ford. They simply fit the engine sizes and the number of cylinders.For diesel engines, they have TDi engines, and for petrol engines, they have TFSi engines.

what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Valve Seal ?	"The most common symptom of bad valve seals is blue smoke from the exhaust pipe. You may also notice oil on the spark plugs if you inspect them. External oil leaks, bad fuel consumption, or rough idling are other signs to look for when your valve seals are bad.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing valve seal to look for:1. Blue Smoke From ExhaustOil Leak On FloorThe most common symptom of a bad valve seal is blue smoke from the exhaust pipe. This can be caused by a leak in the intake valve seal, which causes the engine to consume and burn oil inside the combustion chamber.It can also be an exhaust valve seal leaking, which will push oil directly out to the exhaust pipe, causing it to evaporate.As the problem worsens, the smoke becomes worse and worse. You will notice that the blue smoke lasts longer than before and does not disappear, even at high speeds.2. Oil clogged spark plugsOil On Spark PlugsIf you recently replaced your spark plugs and noticed that there was some strange clay on the spark plug tips, it is most likely coming from burnt oil after the combustion.This oil will burn into the spark plug and create clay, which will stay there. This oil is most likely coming from a leaking intake valve sealing or a failed turbocharger.3. Bad Oil ConsumptionBad Oil Consumption E1609873549750As we discussed before, both a leaking intake and exhaust valve will cause the engine oil to pour out into the exhaust pipe.A normal engine contains around 4 liters of engine oil, and if you keep driving your car with leaking valve seals, you may notice the oil level going down.If you notice bad oil consumption together with any of the other symptoms here, it is a good time to give your car to a mechanic for a look.4. External Oil leaksOil Leak On Floor E1609873630617If you have a turbocharged car, the turbo pressure can go past the intake valve seals if worn, which causes the pressure in the crankcase house to increase.Increased crankcase pressure can result in external oil leaks from different engine sealings, and even cause sealings to pop out completely from the engine.5. Rough IdlingCar Engine Rough Idle E1609793094987A defective valve seal is easily noticeable when your car is idling. The car engine is often susceptible to holding a steady low, idling RPM.Because of this, when a valve seal is bad and there is oil going into the combustion chamber, you might notice rough idling, or you might even stall sometimes.It can also be caused by oil clogged on the spark plugs, caused by bad intake valve seals.If you experience rough idling together with blue smoke, it is definitely time to check your valve seals.6. Loss in AccelerationCar Acceleration E1609869867245The valve seals can also be so bad that the valves, spark plugs, and catalytic converter get clogged with burnt oil.This can cause a heavy performance issue with your car, and it can feel much slower than usual, especially if your catalytic converter is clogged."
what is The Function of a Valve Seal ?	"The valve seal aims to separate the intake flow and the exhaust flow entering the crankcase. It prevent oil oil from going into the cylinders and out through the exhaust.The valve seals are made of a metallic outer ring and a high heat-resistant rubber sealing against the valve.Valve seals seldom go bad on modern engines, but it can happen in some rare cases."
where the Valve seal location ?	"The valve seals are located in the cylinder head, under the valve springs, installed around and sealing the valves.They are located under the valve springs, so you might have to remove the valve cover to see them. IN order to reach them, you may have to remove the valve springs, as well."
what is the Valve Seal Replacement Cost ?	"The average valve seal replacement cost is between $250 and $2100 for all valve seals, depending on the car model and labor costs. The valve seals are cheap, and you can expect a cost of $50 to $100 for all of them. The labor cost typically falls between $200 and $2000.To replace the valve seals, you have to remove the valve cover to remove the valve springs so you can reach the valve seals.In many cases, you can pressurize the cylinder chamber to remove the valve springs without removing the cylinder head completely, but sometimes you have to remove the whole cylinder head.This can, of course, be very time consuming, and it can take a lot of hours to replace the valve seals.If you can do the job by yourself, you can do it cheaply, because the cost of the valve seals is pretty cheap. It is the time it takes to replace them that hurts your wallet the most when you hire someone else to do it.Worn valve seals are not a very common problem. Because of the high replacement cost, you?ll want to be sure to do proper research before you replace them."
Valve Stem Seals Replacement ?	"Valve stem seals are small components that are responsible for preventing oil from entering the combustion chamber through the intake and exhaust valves. Over time, these seals can become worn or damaged, resulting in oil consumption and blue smoke from the exhaust. Here are the steps to replace valve stem seals:Remove the valve covers: Start by removing the valve covers to gain access to the valves and valve springs.Remove the spark plugs: Remove the spark plugs to relieve pressure in the cylinders.Compress the valve springs: Use a valve spring compressor tool to compress the valve springs and remove the retainers.Remove the old seals: Use a seal puller tool or pliers to remove the old valve stem seals from the valve guides.Install the new seals: Install the new valve stem seals onto the valve guides using a seal installer tool, making sure they are seated correctly.Reinstall the valve springs: Use the valve spring compressor tool to reinstall the valve springs and retainers.Reinstall the valve covers: Reinstall the valve covers and torque the bolts to the manufacturer's specifications.Reinstall the spark plugs: Reinstall the spark plugs and torque them to the manufacturer's specifications.Test for leaks: Start the engine and check for oil leaks or smoke from the exhaust. If there are no leaks or smoke, the repair is complete.If you are not comfortable replacing valve stem seals yourself, it is best to take your vehicle to a qualified mechanic for this repair."
What Are The Symptoms Of Low Fuel Pressure?	"The most common symptom of low fuel pressure is an unresponsive throttle or a stalling engine. You may also notice signs like difficulty starting the car, a check engine light on the dashboard, misfires, or low performance.It is very important that you have the right fuel pressure so that your engine can achieve the correct air/fuel ratio. As you can see, there are many issues that can result from low fuel pressure. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of low fuel pressure to look out for:1. Unresponsive ThrottleSlow AccelerationAll cars require proper fuel delivery to their cylinders for them to run properly. If you feel any lags in your car?s pickup, there is a big chance that there is something wrong with your car engine?s fuel pressure.2. Difficulty Starting the CarDifficulty Starting CarLow fuel pressure will also make it hard for you to ignite your car?s engine. At the starting moment, the car requires a lot of fuel, and if it is not getting the right amount of fuel, it will probably not start.You might feel like it takes longer to start your car, or maybe it takes more than one try for a successful ignition. You might also hear some spluttering while trying to start your car.3. Stalling EngineEngine Stall E1609780473516If your car?s engine stalls while running or at idle, it is a clear sign you are having some problems with your fuel pressure. This may be due to fluctuations and sudden drops in the fuel pressure.4. Check Engine Light Comes to LifeCheck Engine Light On Dashboard E1609869927250Today?s electronic cars have a fuel pressure sensor that intelligently calculates if anything is going wrong with the fuel pressure.Generally, with such a problem, you will get a P0190 code accompanying your problem. If the check engine light occurs, you should read the trouble codes with a diagnostic scanner to determine the problem.5. Turbo LagTurbo LagMany people might not have turbos in their cars, but those who do have another way of knowing if there?s something wrong with their fuel pressure.The turbo system uses air and pressurizes it to create a turbine-like effect on the engine, allowing it to create more power.However, if you feel your turbo is taking too long to spool, there might be something wrong with your fuel pressure.6. MisfiresCar Misfires E1609774947173Low fuel pressure in the fuel system will cause an off-balance air/fuel mixture and that, in turn, causes weak combustion. This can be felt as misfires on acceleration or even at idle.Fortunately, the fuel system in a car requires only minor tweaks. Sometimes the problem is minor, and at times, it can be huge.7. Low PerformanceCar AccelerationThe most common symptom of low fuel pressure is a wrong air/fuel mixture, which will cause your car?s performance to drop drastically.If you feel that your car?s performance is much worse than it usually is, it is time to check your fuel pressure."
what are the Causes of Low Fuel pressure ?	"The most common causes of low fuel pressure are a clogged oil filter or a bad fuel pump. It can also be caused by a bad fuel pressure regulator, a stuck fuel injector, a fuel pressure sensor, or a smashed fuel pressure line.Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of low fuel pressure:1. Clogged Fuel FilterThe fuel filter cleans the fuel entering the engine. The fuel filter should be replaced at regular intervals, and if you have not changed it for a long time, it could be that you have a clogged fuel filter causing low fuel pressure.2. Bad Fuel PumpA bad fuel pump is probably the most common cause of low fuel pressure. Sometimes the fuel pump slows down or becomes internally damaged, and when this happens, it isn?t able to push enough fuel to the engine, causing low fuel pressure.3. Bad Fuel Pressure RegulatorThe fuel pressure regulator controls the fuel pressure in the fuel rail. If there is something wrong with the fuel pressure regulator, it can create too low or too high fuel pressure in the rail. The fuel pressure regulator doesn?t fail very often, but it is still worth checking to see if it might be causing your problem.4. Stuck Fuel InjectorIf one of the fuel injectors is damaged and stuck open, this can cause a low fuel pressure in the rail. You will often notice this by misfire codes on a specific cylinder at the same time.5. Bad Fuel pipe LineIf you have been driving on a bumpy road or offroad for a while, there is a risk that you have hit a stone or something similar.The fuel pipes under the car are often made out of steel or aluminum, and if you hit a stone, there is a risk that these become compressed ? which will, in return, result in low fuel pressure.6. Fuel pressure sensorThe fuel pressure sensor feels the pressure in the fuel rail. Some cars have electric fuel pressure regulators, which are controlled by the fuel pressure sensor.If your fuel pressure sensor reads the wrong pressure, it might trick the fuel pressure regulator into releasing the fuel pressure."
how to make Fuel Pressure Testing ?	"To test the fuel pressure in the fuel rail, you need a fuel pressure gauge and a few other parts to attach it to the rail. Then you need to find the correct fuel pressure specifications for your car model and check to see if the fuel pressure is the same as it should be."
Can I drive with low fuel pressure?	"No. It?s not advisable to drive with low fuel pressure because it can cause damage to your engine. If the fuel pressure gets too low, it will starve the engine of fuel and cause it to stall. If your engine is not getting enough fuel, it will cause heat in the pistons, which can damage your engine severely."
How do I increase fuel pressure?	"Other than repairing the problem causing the low fuel pressure, there aren?t many ways to increase fuel pressure on modern cars without replacing some parts. If you want to increase the fuel pressure, you will need to install an aftermarket adjustable fuel pressure regulator."
How do I check if my fuel filter is clogged?	"There is no good way to check if your fuel filter is clogged other than a visual inspection and checking to see if the fuel inside is dirty. However, fuel filters are cheap and if you suspect your fuel filter is clogged, replace it!"
Will low fuel pressure cause no start?	"Yes. Low fuel pressure can cause your car not to start. During the startup moment, the engine requires a lot of fuel, and if it cannot provide it due to low fuel pressure, your engine will not start."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Engine Control Module (ECM) ?	"The most common symptom of a bad engine control module is a check engine light on the dashboard. You may also notice engine performance issues like a misfiring or a stalling engine. If your car won?t start at all, it?s also a strong sign your ECM is bad.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing engine control module (ECM) to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightAll modern vehicles come equipped with a Check Engine Light to let you know when something is wrong. While this light can illuminate as a result of a long list of troubles, having a bad ECM is one.If a sensor, circuit or other electrical component of the ECM has gone bad, it will turn on the Check Engine Light. The only way to diagnose the cause is with an OBDII trouble code scanner.2. Engine Misfiring/StallingEngine StallAs the ECM starts to fail, the wrong messages get sent to the engine, creating an imbalance. The faulty computer leads to a misfiring condition. In extreme cases, the car might even stall while sitting at a traffic light.However, these symptoms are erratic. One day the car might run fine and the next day, it can be challenging to control. There?s no pattern to the severity or frequency when the ECM is going out. 3. Performance IssuesSlow Acceleration CarAll engine performance issues can be linked back to a possible defective ECM. When this module goes bad, it can create an imbalance in the fuel-air ratio or the timing settings of the engine. What you are left with is a decrease in performance, especially when you attempt to push the gas pedal down or you are towing up a hill. If you are noticing less acceleration or a reduction in power, it could be the ECM. 4. Decreased Fuel EconomyThe defective ECM makes it difficult for the engine to properly regulate fuel intake. For this reason, your motor might start burning more fuel when the engine control module is going bad.If you keep an eye on the fuel economy, you might notice the trouble early. However, spending more time at the gas pump should be a sure-fire sign that something is wrong.5. Car Won?t StartWhen the ECM fails completely, your car may not start any longer. With no engine management, the motor simply doesn?t know what to do. Maybe you will hear it attempt to crank, but it can?t start without the right amount of air and fuel being injected. However, having a car that won?t start doesn?t automatically mean you have a bad ECM. It could also be a dead car battery, trouble with the ignition system or a fault in the fuel system. "
where the Engine Control Module (ECM) Location ?	"The location of the engine control module depends on the vehicle you are driving. However, it?s almost always easy to access. You might find the ECM in the engine compartment. However, some vehicles have it under the dashboard, under the driver?s seat or behind the glove compartment. Check your vehicle?s service manual to find the precise location. "
what is The Function of the Engine Control Module ?	"The ECM is also known as the engine control unit. It is by far one of the most essential components found in the modern vehicle. It serves as the primary computer for the engine?s performance and drivability. The ECM takes data from the various sensors on the vehicle and calculates what the engine needs to do. It analyzes aspects such as fuel delivery, engine spark and air ratios. Because all of the operations of the vehicle are controlled by the ECM, it can cause a lot of problems when it malfunctions. In extreme cases, the vehicle can become impossible to drive. "
what is the Engine Control Module (ECM) Replacement Cost ?	"The average engine control module replacement cost is between $500 and $1000 on most car models. The ECM itself will cost about $450 to $900. That leaves $50 to $100 in labor expenses.If you choose to change the ECM yourself, you aren?t going to save a lot of money because the main cost is for the engine control module itself. The cost for the ECM also varies based on what type of vehicle you drive. If you have a small, compact car, you will pay a lot less than the driver of the large luxury SUV. Before you have the ECM replaced, the shop will want to diagnose it first. This is an additional expense that could cost as little as $100 or as much as $300. This is one area that you can save money if you have a code scanner on hand. However, you might need to do a little research online to figure out what the trouble codes mean.If you want to save money, you might be tempted to purchase a used ECM. While this is tempting, it?s simply not the best solution. For one, the used ECM doesn?t usually have a warranty, so it could fail at any moment. Additionally, it will still need to be reprogrammed, which adds to the expense.In a few cases, the shop might be able to reprogram or reconfigure your existing ECM. When this happens, the cost is much lower since you won?t need to purchase a new engine control module.Some engine control modules need to be programmed by the car manufacturer when replaced because of the immobilizer. Therefore you need to check this with the dealer before you try to switch it."
What is the EVAP Function?	"EVAP stands for an evaporative emission control system. The function of the EVAP is to keep harmful fuel fumes where they belong ? in the tank, instead of out in the atmosphere. With a properly running EVAP system, air pollution is kept to a minimum. Additionally, this crucial system ensures the odor of fuel doesn?t reach the cabin of the vehicle. "
What is an EVAP Leak?	"An EVAP leak means a leaking Evaporative Emission Control System. Also, a trouble code indicating an EVAP leak tells you there is a problem with the evaporative emission control system. There are many parts that make up this system, so it?s imperative to read the diagnostic code fully. The leak could be coming from the gas cap, vacuum feed line or gas tank filler tube. It might also be from the charcoal canister or vacuum control valve. "
What Causes An EVAP Leak?	"The most common cause of an EVAP leak or an EVAP leak trouble code is a gas cap that wasn?t properly secured. This typically happens right after filling up the car at the gas station.Many people head to the mechanic when the Check Engine Light comes on, only to realize that the gas cap hadn?t been tightened correctly or that they didn?t shut off their car engine while they were refueling.If the gas cap is properly secured, then there could be a more serious problem. It could be due to a leak in one of the hoses or a defective O-ring seal. There might also be a malfunctioning leak detection pump or faulty purge valve. The best and most efficient way to find a leak is to use an EVAP smoke machine."
what are the Symptoms of an EVAP Leak ?	"The most common symptom of an EVAP leak is a fuel smell coming from your car and a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice issues like poor engine performance or a failed emission test in rare cases.Here is a more detailed list of the most common symptoms you may notice when you have an EVAP leak.1. Fuel SmellBad Car Smell E1609777166642One of the most obvious signs that you are facing an EVAP leak is the smell of fuel. The gas you put into your vehicle is liquid, but it becomes a gas in the system, creating many fumes. The smallest fault in the EVAP system can allow a vapor leak that creates a noxious odor. You won?t have any trouble recognizing the smell, and will immediately know something is wrong. It?s never safe to have gasoline vapors escaping the system, which is why you want to have it checked out right away. 2. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightOne of the first symptoms of an EVAP leak is also the presence of the Check Engine Light. Typically this goes hand-in-hand with a fuel smell. However, the Check Engine Light can mean so many things. The only way to tell for sure if it is a leak is to run a scan with your diagnostic tool. 3. Poor Engine PerformanceWhen a leak exists in the EVAP system, your engine might not be able to run as it should. Not only could you experience rough idling, but there might be trouble with acceleration, too.Without the right amount of fuel in the system, the gas-air mixture becomes unbalanced. Combustion must occur perfectly for the engine to run right, but it can?t when there is a leak. 4. Hard StartWhen the system has a leak, air can get into the fuel system. This problem creates an imbalance in the air and fuel ratio, causing trouble when it comes time to start the engine.If you are having trouble getting your car started, it doesn?t automatically mean a leak. That?s why it?s vital to have a professional look at your vehicle. 5. Failed Emissions TestSometimes, drivers don?t even know there is a leak until they head to have an emissions test. Failing the emissions test is a sign that something might be wrong with your EVAP system. If the system can?t direct the vapors into the combustion chamber of the engine or filter them out with the tailpipe, they will leak out of the car in other ways. This situation leads to an excess of pollutants that will flag your vehicle during the test. "
How Much Does it Cost to Repair an EVAP Leak?	"The EVAP leak repair cost depends on what type of code you are facing. Replacing a broken gas cap only costs you about $10, while the price to replace an EVAP canister is much more. In fact, these canisters can often cost $200 or more just for the parts.The best way to diagnose the fault is to use an OBDII scanner. This diagnostic tool will lead you in the right direction, showing you where to look for the leak. If you can fix the problem yourself, you can save a lot of money."
Is it Safe to Drive with an EVAP Leak?	"Technically, there?s nothing stopping you from driving with an EVAP leak. However, it?s never wise to travel while gas fumes are infiltrating the cabin or the atmosphere around the car.When the Check Engine Light comes on, inspect the gas cap first. If that isn?t your problem, head to a professional to have the system looked at. "
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Starter Motor ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad starter motor are no activity at all or a whirring noise when you turn the key trying to start the engine. You may also notice a burnt smell or see smoke from the engine compartment.These are the few ways that you can use to determine if your starter is bad or not. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing starter motor to look for:1. No Activity at AllStarting CarIdeally, the starter should immediately turn the engine when you turn the ignition key. If there is absolutely no activity in the engine after your ignition attempt, this probably means that the starter solenoid or starter motor has gone wrong.Bad wirings or a dead battery could also cause this, so it should be diagnosed properly before replacing parts.2. Whirring NoiseHard StartingIf you turn the ignition and hear a whirring noise, but nothing seems to happen with the engine itself, it may be caused by a faulty starter solenoid or a faulty pinion gear.When you turn the ignition, it should send power to the starter motor and at the same time send a signal to the starter solenoid to engage. When the starter solenoid is receiving the signal, it engages a gear that is pushed out to engage to the flywheel to spin the engine.If the starter solenoid fails to engage the gear or a problem with the flywheel gear ? you may experience a whirring noise.3. Grinding or Clattering SoundDiagnose Car EngineFrom the same principle as a whirring noise, you may also experience grinding or clattering noise from the starter motor when you turn the ignition if it fails.This can be due to broken internal parts such as broken axles or bearings. To determine what part inside of the starter has gone bad, you need to disassembly the starter motor for a closer look.We can determine, though, that if there is a strange noise from the starter when you turn the ignition, but nothing happens with the engine, there is a problem inside of it.4. Bad Smell When CrankingBad Smell In CarA starter motor is an electric motor that has a solenoid working as a ?clutch.? If you have any previous experience with electric motors, you may know that they can start to smell bad if they are about to fail.The same thing applies to the starter motor. If you feel a burnt smell at the same time as you are trying to crank the engine, there is a big risk that something inside of the starter motor is faulty.It can also be caused by a bad connection in the power wires going to the starter, so check carefully where the smell is coming from.5. Smoke Rising from The StarterWhite Smoke EngineA failing starter motor can not only cause a bad smell from it. If it has gone bad, it can actually also start to smoke out of it.Smoke can also come from a lot of different parts of your engine, but if the smoke is only coming when you crank the engine from a location near the starter ? there is a huge risk that the smoke is coming from the starter.Let a friend or family member check around the starter when you crank the engine to determine if it?s coming from there."
where the Starter Motor Location ?	"The starter motor is located on the back of the engine block near the flywheel between the engine and the transmission.It can be difficult to reach through because it needs to be located on the engine?s rear.You will most often find it bolted to the engine block, but it can in some cases also be installed on the gearbox pointing towards the engine."
how to test  the Starter ?	"You can also test a starter to make sure it is functioning before installing it again or to make sure it is faulty before you replace it.Unfortunately ? to test it properly, you need to remove it from the vehicle.It is possible to test it when installed on the car, but it is definitely not recommended because when you test, it will turn the engine which is a security issue when you have your arms in the engine bay at the same time."
what is the Starter Motor Replacement Cost ?	"The average starter replacement cost is between $250 and $900, depending on the car model and labor costs. A replacement starter can cost you between $150 and $400, and the labor costs 100$ to 500$.The starter?s cost also depends on the car model and the availability of the starter on the market.Some starter motors are super-easy to replace and can be done within 10 minutes, while on other car models, it may take several hours.To replace a starter yourself, you often need at least basic knowledge about cars, and it is not a recommended job for beginners."
Can I jump start a car with a bad starter?	"If the starter is bad, it will not help to jump-start the car. This is because the starter already has power to it, so that is not the problem. However, if your car battery is dead, causing the starter to be dead ? it will help."
How do I bypass a bad starter?	"The easiest way to ?bypass? a starter is to run a wire between the starter solenoid and the positive cable on the starter motor. This will cause the engine to turn if installed on the vehicle, so make sure the car is neutral, and you have no fingers near moving parts."
How can I tell if its the starter or battery?	"The easiest way to determine if there is a problem with the starter or the car battery is to measure the battery?s voltage with a multimeter. Let a friend sit inside the car, cranking the engine while you measure the voltage on the battery. If you read around 11-13 volts, your car battery is fine."
What causes a starter to fail?	"The most common cause of a starter to fail is just normal wear and tear. The starter is often installed towards the clutch system, which will cause dust and debris to come inside of it. The starter also has to make thousands of starts in its lifetime, and therefore it sometimes fails."
What is Rod Knock?	"Rod knock is a deep rapping sound that comes from within the engine. It is caused by rod-bearing wear or damage. The vehicle?s connecting rod bearings have excessive clearance, causing additional movement. As the piston changes direction, the metal starts hitting metal, which produces the knocking noise. This noise will increase as the load and speed go up. "
What does Rod Knock Sound Like?	You can easily notice rod knock if you have ever heard it before. It is often loud bangs coming from your engine when you rev up the engine and let off the gas. You most often hear it directly after you let off the gas.
what are the Causes of Rod Knock ?	"The most common cause of rod knock is worn connection rod bearings. Rod knock is only caused by one thing, but several other causes can lead to symptoms that are similar to rod knock.Here are some of the things that can cause rod knock, or that have similar symptoms as rod knock:1. Worn BearingsBad Rod BearingThe only cause of rod knock per se is worn bearings. As the pistons move up and down in your car engine, they rotate the crankshaft, which is responsible for sending power to the wheels. The bearings are responsible for ensuring that the piston movement remains smooth and controlled.However, these bearings wear out over time and can come out of their position. When the bearings are worn, the piston rods begin rattling against the crankshaft, creating a unique knocking sound. The only way to repair this is to replace the bearings, which are deep within the engine. 2. Low OctaneA detonation knock can sound similar to a rod knock. If the engine runs as it should, the air and fuel mixture burns in a single detonation within each cylinder. However, the detonation knock occurs when that mixture detonates in more than one place at a time, leading to a knocking noise.One such cause of this knock is octane that is too low for the engine. If you have a performance engine, you need a higher octane rating than most cars. High octane burns uniformly, thereby preventing that knock. This problem is an easy fix. It only requires you to use a higher octane fuel the next time you fill the car.3. Poor TimingAnother reason for detonation knock is bad engine timing. The timing refers to the point when the spark plugs fire. This timing is controlled by the computer.When the timing is off, the spark won?t fire when it should, leading to multiple detonations within the cylinders. That?s what causes the detonation knock. To resolve this, the timing must be fixed. 4. Lean Air/Fuel MixtureAnother reason for detonation knock is having a lean air/fuel mixture. This problem can be caused by defective oxygen sensors, failing fuel injectors, a bad fuel pump, or malfunctioning mass airflow sensor. The lean mixture occurs when there isn?t enough fuel and too much air. Without the right amount of fuel, the mixture can?t burn fast enough, which causes multiple detonations. 5. Bad Knock SensorAnother reason for detonation knock is a malfunctioning knock sensor. Thankfully, this doesn?t occur too often on newer cars because the air/fuel ratio, timing and fuel injectors are controlled by the computer. The knock sensor detects any situation leading to the noise and alerts the ECU, where corrective action can be taken right away. So, if the car has a bad knock sensor, the computer won?t know to correct issues and might allow the engine to knock. 6. Bad Belt Tensioners/PulleysThe final reason that you might hear an engine knock is because of something that isn?t coming from the engine at all. When the accessory belt doesn?t have the right amount of tension, it can create a similar noise.As the engine rotates, the belt turns. It?s connected to numerous pulleys in the engine bay and must be pulled just right to work quietly and smoothly. If the belt gets loose, it means the tensioner isn?t working right. However, you can also have problems if one of the pulleys gets bent. This condition leads to rattling, slapping, and clicking noises that can be mistaken for engine knock. To fix this, you simply need to replace the belt, tensioner or pulley. "
What Are The Symptoms of Rod Knock?	"The main symptoms of rod knock include:Knocking soundsLow oil pressureIf the vehicle truly has a worn-out rod bearing and it isn?t knocking because of one of the other reasons, there will be two common symptoms. Here is more detailed information about these two signs of rod knock:1. Knocking SoundsObviously, the main symptom of a rod knock is a knocking sound. You will likely hear this loud banging when you first start the car.It will also increase as you up the load on your vehicle or push the accelerator down. 2. Low Oil PressureWhen a bearing has failed or starts to fail, you might notice lower oil pressure than normal. It?s most evident when the vehicle first starts up. The Check Engine Oil light might even come on your dash, letting you know about the pressure. If the light goes out and pressure returns to normal after a few minutes, this is a strong indication that a bearing has gone bad. "
what is the Rod Knock Repair Cost ?	"The rod knock repair cost will be $2,500 or higher. On a few vehicles, such as a Subaru Forester, the connecting rod repair can easily be $5,000 or more with parts and labor. Connecting rod bearing replacement is not an easy task. The defective part is located deep within the engine. You will need the connecting rod bearings, but also cylinder head bolts, new engine gaskets and seals. Plus, the engine and cooler lines all need to be flushed. In some situations, you will also need new connecting rods, pistons, timing chains, crankshaft and camshaft bearings. With all these extra parts involved, it might be better to consider an engine replacement instead."
What is Engine Blow-By?	"Engine blow-by is compressed air and fuel in the cylinder combustion chamber going through the piston rings into the crankcase ventilation, usually due to worn piston rings, worn pistons, or a damaged cylinder wall.Internal combustion engines operate through the ignition of air and fuel. When this explosion makes its way to the crankcase through the piston rings and then out of the engine, a blow-by occurs.If the pistons are leaking and causing the blow-by, you may also notice a loss of horsepower. If not solved, blow-by will cause further engine trouble and will also cause increased engine oil consumption."
what are the  Causes of Blow-by ?	"The most common causes of blow-by are worn-out piston rings, worn pistons, or damaged cylinder walls. In some cases, you may mistake blocked crankcase ventilation for blow-by, so it?s good the check for clogged crankcase ventilation before checking for blow-by.There are a few different things that could cause blow-by. Blow-by is a bad thing and often not easy or cheap to fix.However, if you experience blow-by, you will want to check the crankcase breathing to make sure it?s not blocked first.Here is a more detailed list of the four most common causes of engine blow-by.1. Worn out pistonsDamaged PistonPistons are vital for moving the crankshaft. When the pistons start wearing out, they become smaller while the cylinder walls become larger. Pistons are mostly made from aluminum, which happens to be a soft metal. When it wears out, it creates grooves in the piston while deposit accumulation occurs on the cylinder walls.The fuel-air mixture soon finds its way into the crankcase. It can also be due to holes in the pistons from a knocking engine.2. Worn piston ringsPiston Ring FunctionThe piston rings are continuously being pushed back and forth in the cylinder wall, and with time they become worn and destroyed. This leads to leakage of gases, which causes blow-by.Sometimes, the piston rings can get stuck, and this will often be solved by pouring some diesel into the cylinder and letting it sit for a while. With a little luck, they will come loose and seal against the cylinder wall again.If not, the only way is to replace them, which is a very costly repair.3. Damaged cylinder wallsEngine CylindersThe continuous movement of the pistons will, with time, lead to damaged cylinder walls. It can also come from damaged pistons or piston rings.You can often notice damaged cylinder walls by listening for piston slap. Luckily, worn-out cylinder walls are not very common. If that happens, you either need to bore the cylinders to a bigger size and replace the pistons, or you have to replace the engine block.4. Faulty Crankcase ventilationCrankcase VentilationIn some cases, you can mistake blocked crankcase ventilation for blow-by. The crankcase ventilation?s job is to recycle blow-by into the intake again. If the crankcase ventilation hoses are blocked, it will push it out from the oil cap once you open it, and you may think that your engine has a lot of blow-by.Check the crankcase ventilation and make sure it is clear of any dirt."
How do you fix a blow by?	"If you really think that your car?s engine has a lot of blow-by, you might want to know how to fix it.Fixing blow-by is often not very easy, as worn pistons or piston rings are usually at fault. However, there are some things you need to do to fix it.1. Clean Crankcase VentilationThe first thing you need to do is check your crankcase ventilation to make sure it is clear of sludge and dirt. Try to remove a hose and blow through it to make sure it?s clear. Also, check the PCV valve.2. Oil TreatmentSometimes it happens that the piston rings get stuck and will not seal against the cylinder walls. If you are lucky, this can be solved by pouring some diesel into the cylinders and letting them sit for a day or two.3. Replace Piston RingsIf the diesel or additive didn?t fix your problem, you might need to replace the piston rings. To replace the piston rings, you need to remove the engine block?s pistons, which is a big repair. You can do a leak-down test to make sure the piston rings or pistons are causing the problems.4. Replace PistonsYou may also want to scrutinize the pistons while you replace the piston rings. If you see any damage to the pistons, you may need to replace them as well. When you replace the pistons, you often want to resurface the engine block.5. Replace Engine Block or Remanufacture CylindersIf your cylinder walls have scratches and are worn, you may need to resurface them or bore bigger cylinders with bigger pistons. The other option is to replace the engine block instead."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Voltage Regulator ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad voltage regulator are a stalling engine and a battery warning light on your dashboard. It may also cause the voltage to spike, which can damage electrical parts in your car. At night, you might also notice flickering headlights.Because of the importance of a good voltage in your vehicle, a voltage regulator can cause many different symptoms.Below is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing voltage regulator to look for:1. Too High Voltage in the BatteryMeasure Car Battery VoltageThere are two ways a voltage regulator can fail. First, it can stop directing enough voltage to the battery. Second, it can direct too much power to the battery. If it?s sending too much power, you?re going to run into problems sooner rather than later.A fully charged battery has 12.6 volts, but it?s not uncommon for them to sit at 13.7 volts while the alternator charges them. Anything more than that can cause damage. You?ll notice the battery is getting far too warm, potentially warping, and if left alone long enough, potentially cracking or exploding.2. Dead BatteryDead Car BatteryYou?ll get too much voltage if the voltage regulator isn?t diverting power when it should. If it?s not sending enough voltage to the battery, it will constantly be dead.It can be one of the more frustrating components to troubleshoot because you don?t usually start looking at your voltage regulator when your vehicle isn?t starting as it should.It is quite easy to measure the charging voltage from the alternator with a multimeter though.3. Battery Light or Check Engine LightBattery Alternator LightWhether your voltage regulator is neglecting to charge your battery or it?s overcharging it, various sensors might activate either a check engine light or a battery light. If either of these lights pops on, you should stop driving your car immediately.Either your vehicle might die altogether, or the battery might overcharge and explode. Either way, nothing good is going to come of it.4. Inconsistent Operation of Electrical ComponentsDashboard Warning LightsIf your voltage regulator is operating intermittently, the electrical components around your vehicle will operate that way too. Whether it?s your radio, dashboard lights, or more critical components like your fuel pump, you?ll notice inconsistent operation.If you have a lot of strange electrical problems, it may be too low or too high voltage caused by the voltage regulator.5. Vehicle Dies While RunningCar Stop After RoadIf your voltage regulator isn?t directing enough power to the battery while the engine is running, your vehicle will shut off as you?re driving down the road.Your vehicle needs voltage to run, so if it?s not getting any, you?re going to run into problems. This will typically only be a problem if either the voltage regulator or the alternator completely fails.6. Dimming/Pulsing LightsDim Headlights CarIf your vehicle?s voltage regulator is working inconsistently, then you might notice that your lights are ?pulsing? as they get brighter and dimmer. This happens when your voltage regulator is unable to maintain a consistent voltage like it?s supposed to.However, if your voltage regulator is starting to fail and does not maintain the proper amount of voltage, you might notice that you have lights that aren?t as bright as they should be."
what is the Voltage Regulator Function ?	"At the risk of sounding redundant, your voltage regulator regulates your voltage. If that doesn?t make sense, keep reading, and I?ll break down exactly how it does it.All of the voltage starts in your alternator, but since it?s belt-driven, it creates voltage whenever your engine is running. But your battery can only handle up to 14.5 volts at a time (12.6 volts is a full charge). If the alternator kept dumping all that voltage into the battery, it would blow up!Your voltage regulator monitors your battery?s current-voltage and sends voltage that way when it starts to dip too low. When the battery has enough voltage, the regulator diverts all that excess power to the ground, effectively eliminating it from the system.When everything is working correctly, it?s an extremely efficient system that keeps everything working the way it should."
how to Test A Voltage Regulator ?	"A voltage regulator is an important component of your car's charging system, responsible for maintaining a stable voltage output to the battery and electrical components. Here are the steps to test a voltage regulator:Prepare the test equipment: You will need a digital multimeter (DMM) to perform the test. Set the multimeter to the DC voltage setting.Locate the voltage regulator: The voltage regulator is usually located on or near the alternator.Connect the multimeter: Connect the red lead of the multimeter to the positive terminal of the battery and the black lead to the negative terminal.Start the engine: Start the engine and let it idle.Measure the voltage: Measure the voltage across the battery terminals with the multimeter. The voltage should be between 13.5 and 14.5 volts. If the voltage is lower or higher than this range, it may indicate a faulty voltage regulator.Check the regulator wiring: If the voltage is outside the normal range, check the wiring between the alternator and voltage regulator for loose connections or damaged wiring.Check the voltage regulator output: If the wiring is good, check the voltage regulator output by connecting the multimeter to the regulator output terminal. The voltage should be the same as the voltage measured across the battery terminals.Replace the voltage regulator: If the voltage is still outside the normal range, or the output is incorrect, the voltage regulator may need to be replaced.If you are not comfortable testing the voltage regulator yourself, it is best to take your car to a qualified mechanic for this test."
where the Voltage Regulator Location ?	"Most of the time, the voltage regulator is located on the alternator?s back or inside the alternator.Some vehicles will have the voltage regulator mounted off to the side of the alternator, but That is quite rare.If the voltage regulator is located inside the alternator, it can be challenging to locate depending on the alternator type. While some manufacturers put them in easy-to-access locations, others bury them.As a final twist, many newer vehicles are starting to incorporate the voltage regulator directly into the Engine Control Module (ECM). It runs off a separate circuit in these systems, and you can?t replace just the voltage regulator."
what is the Voltage Regulator Replacement Cost ?	"The average voltage regulator replacement cost is between $70 and $400, depending on the car model and labor costs. A voltage regulator costs $20 to $200, and the labor costs $50 to $200.Depending on which vehicle you drive, replacing the voltage regulator can mean replacing the entire alternator or just the regulator.If you need to replace the entire alternator, it usually costs between $200 and $500 for the part alone. From there, it?s usually a pretty easy job for a mechanic, so you can expect to spend between $50 and $100 in labor.A Voltage regulator typically costs between $20 and $200. While it?s a big price range, they usually cost a little less if you drive a smaller vehicle. Labor costs vary as well, depending on how easy the regulator is to access.Because of their varying locations, voltage regulators can cost as little as $50 for labor, but for some vehicles, it?s possible to spend closer to $200.If you?re mechanically inclined, you can replace both an alternator with a voltage regulator and a standalone voltage regulator without too much of a hassle."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Powertrain Control Module (PCM) ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad PCM are poor engine performance and a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice problems with the transmission, like shifting issues. Poor fuel economy and increased emissions are also quite common.While it?s not common for a PCM to break, it does happen from time to time. Before you jump straight to the PCM, though, rule out any other potential causes.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing powertrain control module to look for:1. A Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light On Dashboard E1609869927250The first sign that your PCM is having issues is likely going to be a check engine light. The light could be for anything related to the powertrain. Just keep in mind that the problem is more likely with the sensor, wiring, or just about anything else.If your vehicle has a check engine light, rule out every other possible cause before jumping to the PCM. Check the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner2. Poor PerformanceSlow AccelerationYour PCM controls performance, so it makes sense that if it?s not responding correctly, performance will suffer. The more screwed up your PCM is, the more likely you?ll have multiple issues leading to poor performance.However, if just a single part of your PCM isn?t working correctly, you may only have poor performance under certain conditions, like idling or accelerating.3. Problems StartingHard StartingIf your PCM problems get bad enough, you might not be able to get your vehicle started. At the very least, it might be hard to start, especially in colder conditions.If your vehicle is having problems starting and it?s related to the PCM, it?s a pretty serious problem that you need to have looked at before you total your engine.4. Increased EmissionsBlack Smoke From ExhaustWhen everything is working correctly, your PCM minimizes your vehicle?s emissions by optimizing performance. When it?s not working the way it should, performance suffers, and you?ll likely have an increase in emissions. However, unless you?re taking your vehicle for an emission test, you probably won?t notice anything different.5. Poor Fuel EconomyBad Fuel ConsumptionIf everything isn?t working correctly, it?s not surprising that your fuel economy will suffer as a result. For instance, you?ll need to accelerate more if your turbo isn?t generating enough boost because the PCM isn?t telling it to.There are tons of examples like this, but with a faulty PCM, you?ll likely be wasting fuel.6. Shifting ProblemsCar Shifting Problems E1609782519191If your vehicle is having problems shifting into different gears, then the PCM might be the problem. Your PCM controls everything that both your engine and your transmission does. So, if you?re having any issues with your powertrain, you might be able to trace it back to the PCM.If your vehicle is having problems shifting, it?s a severe condition that you need to have addressed immediately. Otherwise, your vehicle is going to handle erratically, which can quickly lead to an accident."
what is the PCM Function ?	"The PCM is the brain of the power delivery unit in your engine. It controls various features, including ignition timing, fuel delivery, emissions, turbo boost pressure, idle speed, throttle control, and so much more.While you might?ve heard of Transmission Control Module (TCM) or an Engine Control Module (ECM), a PCM controls both of those functions. So, if your vehicle has a PCM, it either houses both of those components in a single unit, or the one computer controls both functions.The PCM controls all of these functions through a variety of sensors that communicates with it. It starts by sending a control out to an actuator and then measures the actual results through a sensor.The PCM is programmed to tell each actuator what to do when specific commands are met ? like when hit the throttle ? and then it?s programmed to know what the acceptable readings are in response.When something isn?t working correctly, it shoots a warning to the driver through a check engine light. It?s not an easy component to understand, and unless you have the proprietary software, it?s not a component you?re going to fix either."
where the PCM Location ?	"The PCM is most often located in the engine bay near the fuse box or inside the car near the fuse box. It can often also be located under the front windshield behind some covers.There are a few different locations where the manufacturer can place your vehicle?s PCM, but the most common location is in the engine bay. The PCM doesn?t look like anything special ? just a metal box with some wires coming out of it.If your vehicle?s PCM isn?t in the engine bay, it might be inside the passenger compartment. While this location isn?t all that common, if it is there, it is typically underneath the passenger side dashboard ? behind all the plastic coverings.In the ultra-rare instance that your PCM isn?t in either of those locations, it might be in your vehicle?s trunk. This isn?t as common, since all of the wires from the engine will have to run to the vehicle?s rear to communicate with the PCM."
what is the PCM Replacement Cost ?	"The PCM is a computer, and computers aren?t cheap to replace. That?s why the average PCM replacement cost is anywhere between $800 and $1,500, depending on the car model and labor costs.Even worse, this is almost all in the cost of the PCM itself. Labor typically only runs between $75 and $100. But if you think you can save yourself $100 and replace it yourself, think again.That?s because you need to program the PCM to your specific vehicle, and unless you have the proprietary software to do it, you?ll need to take it to the dealership.The good news is that the dealership will see if they can?t reprogram the PCM before replacing it. If you?re lucky, they?ll find an update and reprogram it for you, which generally only costs between $75 and $150."
Can a car run without a PCM?	"No. A car can?t run without a PCM. The PCM (Powertrain Control Module) is responsible for monitoring and controlling all the engine?s and transmission operating parameters, including fuel delivery, ignition timing, and emissions controls. Without a PCM, your car won?t start."
How long does it take to fix a PCM?	"Fixing a PCM isn?t something that most people can do. It really depends on the issue and how comfortable you are with computers. If it?s a simple software problem, it could take less than an hour. However, if it?s a hardware issue, it could take several hours or even require replacing the entire PCM."
How can I test my PCM?	"Testing a PCM is very difficult to do unless you have a lot of experience with these kinds of things. What you can do is test if the PCM is getting voltage and ground with a multimeter, but other than that it?s better to leave it to the pros if you don?t know how to test it."
What is the difference between an ECM and a PCM?	"An ECM, or engine control module, is a computer that controls the engine. A PCM, or powertrain control module, is a computer that controls the transmission and engine in order to optimize fuel economy and power. The two systems are similar, but the ECM focuses specifically on the engine while the PCM regulates both the engine and transmission."
how to test PCM ?	"The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is the brain of your car's engine management system, responsible for controlling various components such as the fuel injectors, ignition system, and emissions system. Here are the steps to test the PCM:Prepare the test equipment: You will need a scan tool that can communicate with the PCM and a digital multimeter (DMM) to perform the test.Connect the scan tool: Connect the scan tool to the car's OBD-II port and turn the key to the ""ON"" position.Read the diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs): Use the scan tool to read any diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) that are stored in the PCM memory. DTCs can provide important information about the problems that the PCM is experiencing.Clear the DTCs: If there are any DTCs present, clear them using the scan tool. Note that clearing the codes will also clear any freeze frame data stored in the PCM.Check the PCM power and ground circuits: Use the DMM to check the power and ground circuits to the PCM. The power circuit should have 12 volts when the key is in the ""ON"" position, and the ground circuit should have less than 100 millivolts of voltage drop.Check the PCM input and output circuits: Use the scan tool and DMM to check the PCM input and output circuits for proper operation. This may involve testing various sensors and actuators such as the oxygen sensor, throttle position sensor, and fuel injectors.Replace the PCM: If the power, ground, input, and output circuits are all functioning properly, but the engine is still experiencing problems, it may indicate a faulty PCM that needs to be replaced.If you are not comfortable testing the PCM yourself, it is best to take your car to a qualified mechanic for this test."
what is the Types of Spark Plugs ?	"The four main types of spark plugs are the copper spark plug, iridium spark plug, platinum spark plug, and double-platinum spark plug. Each spark plug type has its own advantages and disadvantages.We?ve crafted a handy list for you, including the difference in materials used and the differences in efficiency and cost. Here?s a more detailed list of the different types of spark plugs:1. Copper Spark PlugsCopper Spark PlugsCopper spark plugs are the common name for most basic spark plugs that you can get hold of. However, this term is quite incorrect, as standard material plugs do not have electrodes made from copper because copper is a very soft material that will melt fast.A ?Copper Spark plug? or standard spark plug uses a nickel-alloy that may include a small copper core. Actually, all types of spark plugs include a copper core inside of them.The body of these copper spark plugs is physically the largest out of all the ones listed here. This is due to how inefficient they are compared to a larger voltage to generate a spark.These plugs are best suited to older vehicles that don?t have lots of accessories fitted to them and have a basic performing engine. Plugs such as these tend to be fairly cheap to purchase and usually won?t cause any problems as long as they?re changed at regular service intervals ? depending on what the manufacturer recommends. 2. Iridium Spark PlugsIridium Spark PlugThese are some of the top tier plugs that you can get your hands on in the standard consumer market. Being made from Iridium, they will last much longer than standard copper plugs and platinum plugs. This is mainly because of how durable iridium is as a metal. Not only is it incredibly strong and durable, but it?s also a great conductor. This means that the plug?s body can be a lot smaller as it doesn?t require as much electricity to generate a spark, which makes them much more efficient also. You probably think that iridium sounds pretty awesome ? and it is, which is why it comes with a heavy price tag. Although these plugs are quite expensive, however, they?ll usually last around 50,000 miles which means they don?t require changing very often at all. Iridium plugs are often fitted to newer vehicles running higher performance engines; if this is the case for you, we recommend replacing your spark plugs like for like. 3. Platinum Spark PlugsPlatinum Spark PlugPlatinum spark plugs are fairly similar to copper spark plugs in their makeup, except they feature a platinum tip design that is welded to the end of the center electrode, making it much more durable and longer-lasting than the basic nickel alloy tip featured on a copper spark plug. Platinum spark plugs can usually last around 100,000 miles due to their better durability and improved ability to handle higher temperatures.Whilst these plugs are neither the most efficient nor the most durable plugs on the market when compared with iridium spark plugs, they do come at a lower cost. This is what makes them a great middle ground for your vehicle, provided your manufacturer specifies them. 4. Double Platinum Spark PlugsDouble Platinum Spark PlugsAgain, these double platinum spark plugs are similar in design to both a copper and a single platinum spark plug, except they feature a laser welded platinum inlay.This double-platinum design on both the electrode and the inlay makes these plugs even more efficient and durable?all for a lower price than Iridium plugs. These are a great option if you would like an upgrade from single platinum spark plugs, but don?t want to pay out for iridium plugs. "
What is a Spark Plug?	"So, what exactly is a spark plug? A spark plug is used to ignite your fuel as it gets injected into your engine?s combustion chamber. This will only apply to petrol engines as other fuels are ignited by different methods. Your engine will usually have one spark plug per cylinder bore, which gets an electrical feed either directly from a coil pack or indirectly via HT (high tension) leads. In both cases, a high amount of voltage is generated by your vehicle?s coil pack and then sent through to your spark plugs. This electrical energy that gets transmitted will then jump the gap between your plug?s center electrode and it?s ground electrode. As the electrical charge jumps the gap, it gives off a visible spark (hence the name spark plug), and this is the spark that ignites your fuel causing a miniature explosion which is what keeps your pistons moving and your engine turning. What makes the spark plug such a great component is it?s simple design. Whilst it remains one of the most vital parts of your engine and does a vast amount of work, they still remain beautifully simple in their method of operation. Whilst nearly all spark plugs remain the same in how they operate, they do vary in their efficiency, depending on the material they?re made from. "
Conclusionÿ	"Hopefully, this guide has given you an insight into the main differences between the 4 most common spark plugs on the market. As with most things, it?s good to balance spending money up front with potential repairs that need carrying out in the future. Spark plugs are a vital component in your engine and won?t run without them. They?ll keep your engine running not only efficiently but also smoothly. This is why it?s so important to spend the time and money on proper maintenance. Do you want to know which is the best spark plugs to choose?

How Many Spark Plugs Does a Diesel Have?	"The diesel engine has zero spark plugs. Diesel engines operate with the use of glow plugs instead of spark plugs. There is one glow plug for each cylinder in most configurations. Therefore, your 8-cylinder diesel engine would contain eight glow plugs in a normal setup.Gas and diesel engines operate differently. The diesel engine requires the use of a heating device, which is a reason why glow plugs are used. The glow plug and spark plug are similar in design, but the glow plug offers more purpose."
What Are Spark Plugs?	"The spark plug is found in all gasoline-powered engines. Most gas engines contain one spark plug for every cylinder. Therefore, if you had a 6-cylinder gas engine, you would likely find six spark plugs, one for each cylinder.The car engine fires these spark plugs in a particular order to provide the spark needed to ignite the mixture in the combustion chamber. Inside the engine, there is a small explosion happening to ignite the air and fuel mixture. When this explosion occurs, the piston is forced down in the engine, thereby creating the energy that helps push your car forward. However, the diesel engine doesn?t require ignition to operate. Instead, it needs heat and pressure, which is exactly what the glow plugs provide. "
What are Glow Plugs?	"The glow plug operates as a heating element. It looks like a spark plug, but it?s not igniting fuel or air in the pistons. The diesel engine could run without glow plugs, especially in warmer climates. However, this electrical heating device is found in each cylinder and it helps ensure a reliable start once the temperatures start to dip. "
How Many Glow Plugs Does Your Diesel Engine Have?	"It should come as no surprise that the amount of glow plugs is similar to how many spark plugs are found in a gas engine. Your diesel engine likely has one glow plug per cylinder.Therefore, if you have a 6-cylinder diesel, you should find six glow plugs. Likewise, the 8-cylinder diesel often has eight glow plugs. Of course, there are always exceptions to this rule. "
Stages When Glow Plugs are Needed	"1. Pre-IgnitionBefore ignition ever occurs, the glow plugs are heating up the cylinders. Once the ignition is set to the ON position, the glow plugs get to work.In some cases, diesel owners experience better performance if they wait a few minutes from the time they set the ignition to ON before they start the engine. In older vehicles, the heating process can take a little longer, so it?s best to allow for some time. 2. IgnitionAs you start to crank the engine, the glow plugs can also be beneficial. However, glow plugs aren?t used to create a spark that ignites the air and fuel mixture.Instead, during this time, the glow plugs merely assist in keeping the temperatures up for better combustion. With the temperature just right, combustion can occur faster and more efficiently.3. Post-IgnitionThe glow plugs continue to warm the combustion chamber for a while after the engine cranks over. By keeping the temperatures up, combustion occurs efficiently.Additionally, there is less noise output while the combustion chamber heats up. The glow plugs ensure everything continues running smoothly. "
what is the Types of Glow Plugs ?	"1. Pressure Sensor Glow Plugs (PSG)This type of glow plug utilizes an integrated pressure sensor. It improves engine efficiency, as the sensor reports the cylinder pressures to the engine control unit (ECU).PSG plugs do well at starting the vehicle when the weather is colder. They can also improve fuel economy and lower emissions by making combustion easier. 2. Ceramic Glow Plugs (CPG)The ceramic glow plug can heat up much faster. Because they heat up quicker than other types, they will reach optimal temperatures before any other plug.If you live in a colder climate, you will want this high-performance plug. Instead of waiting for the plugs to warm up, you could be starting the engine and burning fuel at optimal temperatures. 3. Steel Glow PlugsThe steel glow plug is one of the cheaper options on the market. It?s designed to save you money, but it still works well enough to be considered reliable.The steel glow plug is available for two- and three-stage glow systems. While two-stage systems are used on older engines, the three-stage is common today. With the steel plug, you can expect a longer starting time, but there should be no issues, even in the coldest weather. "
Diesel Glow Plug Replacement Cost ?	"To replace the glow plugs in a diesel engine, you might spend $200 to $300. The parts could make up $75 to $125 of that cost, while labor would be around $125 to $175. As the glow plugs start to fail, it will take longer for the engine to start, especially in cold climates. If the engine has an external block heater, there are fewer issues as the glow plugs weaken. Until the engine reaches normal operating temperature, there could also be some performance issues. However, it?s possible to drive with bad glow plugs. Because the glow plugs aren?t needed for the normal operation of the running engine, there should be no major issues continuing to use your vehicle after the plugs fail. The time that you would notice the biggest issue is when you try to start the diesel engine in freezing cold temperatures."
How Hot Does A Car Exhaust System Get?	"The temperature within the exhaust system can range from 300 to 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on which part you are looking at. However, the average temperature of the muffler or exhaust pipe is usually between 300 and 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Here is a more detailed list of the temperatures of the different exhaust parts:1. Exhaust ManifoldExhaust ManifoldWhen the gases are coming out of the engine, they are at their hottest point. This is where the gases could easily reach 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit, especially if you are pushing the vehicle hard.The closer you get to the cylinder heads, the hotter the gases will be. As they move away from the engine, they start to cool off slightly. 2. MufflerEven though the muffler is near the end of the exhaust system, it still remains quite hot. In fact, most mufflers can reach temperatures between 300 and 500 degrees Fahrenheit. The higher the RPMs of your engine, the hotter the gases are going to be. Because of these extreme temperatures, you must use caution when replacing or fixing a muffler. 3. Catalytic ConverterBecause there is a chemical reaction taking place in the catalytic converter, this part has a higher temperature reading. You can expect most catalytic converters to reach around 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.However, when the converter becomes overheated, or if unburnt gases travel through, the temperature can rise significantly. In fact, overheated converters can reach over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit and turn bright red. 4. Oxygen SensorsThe oxygen sensors are located throughout the exhaust system. Depending on what location you are looking at, the temperature can vary greatly. At the point of leaving the engine, the first oxygen sensor is going to deal with the most extreme heat. However, the sensors after the catalytic converter doesn?t have it easy either, especially if the converter is overheated. "
what is the Factors Affecting Heat from Exhaust System ?	"1. ConditionThe condition of both the engine and exhaust system makes a huge difference in the temperatures you can expect. If the exhaust system is dealing with any constrictions, it will cause the temperatures to rise.Additionally, the harder the engine has to work to produce power, the hotter the gases become. If the engine is overheating for any reason, the gases could exceed normal operating temperatures. 2. Engine SpeedThe gases are produced from the combustion of the engine. The faster the vehicle moves, the more the engine must work, which means extra gases are moving through the pipes.You are going to notice a big difference between the temperatures of the gases when the engine is running at 800 RPMs versus 1800 RPMs. In fact, if you are simply idling the engine, the pipes won?t get nearly as hot as they do when you are driving your vehicle. 3. Pipe Length & DesignEvery exhaust system features a different design and pipe diameter. The length and width of these pipes affect how cool or hot the exhaust gets. The further the exhaust gases need to travel, the more heat becomes lost in the process. However, if the gases don?t have far to travel, the gas is going to come out hotter, resulting in higher pipe temperatures."
What is the Exhaust System?	"The main purpose of the exhaust system is to remove the gases from the engine. However, it?s also needed to reduce noise and improve the performance of the motor. The exhaust system is made up of several components, including the manifold, catalytic converter, resonator, oxygen sensors, muffler, tail pipe and exhaust pipe. The exhaust system begins at the exhaust manifold. This is where the gases from the engine are collected and directed away from the motor. Typically, the exhaust manifold is made from cast iron, designed to handle the hot fumes coming from the engine. Many manifolds contain multiple cylinders that remove the gases and route them into a single cylinder, known as the front pipe.There will be an oxygen sensor in the beginning of the exhaust system, measuring the level of oxygen in the gas. This information is sent back to the ECU to determine how much fuel must be injected into the engine for proper combustion.The exhaust gases then go through the catalytic converter, where a chemical reaction occurs to reduce toxicity. After this, there should be another oxygen sensor that compares how much oxygen is in the gases with the first reading. This sensor is responsible for making sure the catalytic converter is doing its job. The altered gases move through the resonator, which changes the sounds coming out of the engine. These fumes hit the muffler, which also reduces the sound of the exhaust, based on what kind of chambers it has and what material is used for the construction. At the end of the line, the gases move into the atmosphere through the tail pipe. "
what are the Reasons For White Smoke Coming from the Exhaust Pipe ?	"The most common cause of white smoke coming from the exhaust is condensation from the exhaust system. It can also be caused by a leaking intake manifold gasket, a bad EGR cooler, a blown head gasket, or a cracked cylinder head.White smoke can either be very light, just like a vapor, or it can be dense and heavy smoke. White smoke from the exhaust pipe during startup, idle, or acceleration tells us that coolant or water is getting vaporized in the exhaust pipe.You can also carefully smell the water or smoke from the exhaust; if it smells sweet, it?s most likely coolant, and in this case, you have a bigger problem.Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of white smoke from the exhaust pipe:1. CondensationWhite Smoke From ExhaustThe most common reason for white smoke from the exhaust pipe is condensed water that is getting vaporized.When your car is standing for a long time and hasn?t been used for a day or two, there will be condensation left over from the last time your car was driven.This water will lay in the bottom of your exhaust, and once you start the car, the exhaust will get hot and then vaporize the condense.If the white smoke is light and only comes for a short time after the starting moment at cold starts, there should be nothing to worry about. It?s most likely just condensation.2. Leaking Intake Manifold GasketBad Intake Manifold GasketThis next problem is more serious, but still not too bad. Your intake manifold is the part that divides the air going into the cylinders of your car.Intake manifolds are often cooled by coolant fluid, and therefore they have a gasket between the intake manifold and the cylinder head. Sometimes, the gasket goes bad and starts to leak.If you have a bad intake manifold gasket, you will often smell sweet smoke from the exhaust gases.3. Bad EGR CoolerVolkswagen Egr CoolerIf your exhaust smoke smells sweet, it?s most likely a condensed coolant you are facing.One more common cause of this on modern vehicles is a crack inside the EGR cooler. Not all cars have EGR coolers, though, and it is more common on European cars, but it is definitely worth checking.This can be pretty difficult to diagnose properly as there are no signs you can look for outside the engine.However, if the EGR cooler is cracked, it has to get replaced. If you suspect that your EGR cooler is faulty, you may have to get help from a mechanic to diagnose it properly.The best way is to check inside your cylinders and spark plugs. If the car is combusting coolant, it will clean the cylinders. So if no of the cylinders is cleaned, but the car is still burning coolant, it must come from after the combustion chambers, like from the EGR cooler.4. Blown Head GasketHead GasketThe head gasket is a gasket placed between the engine block and the cylinder head. This gasket separates combustion, oil, and coolant between these two parts.When the head gasket is either damaged or cracked, it can cause coolant to leak into the combustion chambers. The opposite can also happen.This can cause the engine to combust coolant, and it will result in heavy white smoke from your exhaust, depending on the size of the leak.Unfortunately, a blown head gasket is often very expensive to repair because you have to disassemble many parts to replace it.If you want to go further into bad head gasket diagnosing, check out our other article here: Bad Head Gasket Symptoms.5. Cracked Cylinder Head or BlockCylinder HeadAnother not-so-funny thing that can cause white smoke from your exhaust pipe is a cracked cylinder head or engine block. The engine block and the cylinder head are full of channels where the coolant flows to cool the engine down.If you are very unlucky, the engine block or cylinder head may have cracked, and this can cause coolant to flow into the combustion chamber or out through the exhaust.This is very rare, though, and usually only happens after an overheating engine or something similar. It can happen, though, and it occurs more on some engine models than others.To fix these problems, you often have to replace the whole head or block, which results in a complete disassembly of the engine.6. Too Rich Fuel MixtureSmoke From ExhaustOne thing that does not directly cause white smoke from the exhaust, but can be mistaken for it, is a too rich fuel mixture. This is not directly causing white smoke, but it is causing gray smoke, which can easily be mistaken for white smoke.A rich mixture causes gray smoke, and a rich mixture is most often caused by faulty fuel injectors, a faulty MAF sensor, or faulty O2 sensors."
How to Diagnose a Car With White Smoke from the Exhaust ?	"There are several ways to diagnose a car with white smoke. However, some methods are easier and faster than others.Smell the SmokeThe first thing you should do is taste or smell the smoke coming from the exhaust pipe. If it has a sweet smell, it?s coolant.If the smoke doesn?t smell or taste like anything more than water, it?s most likely condensation, and the smoke will go away after the car is heated up.Use a Pressure TesterThe best ? and, in my opinion, only ? way to find internal coolant leaks is with a coolant pressure tester. You fit it on your radiator cap, put pressure inside the coolant system, and let it stand for an hour.Remove the spark plugs or glow plugs and check for any signs of coolant leaks entering the combustion chamber. If you notice coolant, you might have a problem with your head gasket or a cracked cylinder head.If you can?t find any coolant there, remove the pipes to the EGR pipes and check for any coolant signs inside of them. If you notice coolant, there is most likely a crack in the EGR cooler, and you have to replace it."
Can I drive a car with white smoke from the exhaust?	"Whether you can drive your car with white smoke from the exhaust or not depends on how much smoke is coming from the exhaust. If you only notice white smoke when the engine is cold during start-up, it is most likely just caused by condensation. If there is always thick white smoke pouring out of the exhaust, it may be due to a bad head gasket, and you should not continue to drive the car."
What does white smoke from the tailpipe usually indicate?	"White smoke from the exhaust pipe usually indicates either that the car is cold and condensation is evaporating in the exhaust pipe, or that there is a problem with water or coolant being combusted in the cylinders."
Why is white smoke coming out of my exhaust but not overheating?	"If your car has white smoke coming from the exhaust pipe, but is not overheating, it could either be because there is nothing wrong with your car and it is just condensation coming from the pipe. It can also be caused if your EGR valve is leaking coolant into the exhaust pipe."
What color should exhaust smoke be?	"Exhaust smoke should be slightly grey. If the exhaust smoke is white, it may mean that water or coolant is being combusted. If it is blue, it may mean that oil is burnt in the cylinders. If it?s black, it could mean your engine is running rich."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad EGR Valve ?	"The most common symptom of a bad EGR valve is a check engine light illuminated on your dashboard. You may also notice bad fuel consumption, reduced power, and rough idle. Your car may also fail an emission test with a bad EGR valve.Here down below, you will find a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing EGR valve to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightThere are tons of sensors monitoring your emissions, engine performance, and even the EGR valve?s performance. Whether the EGR valve is clogged, stuck open, or stuck closed, you?re going to get a check engine light.While the check engine light will usually point you straight to the EGR valve, it is possible that it might come on due to a symptom instead of a cause. For instance, you might get a check engine light that indicates excessive exhaust chemicals or misfires, even though the problem stems from a faulty EGR valve.2. Increased EmissionsCar Emission TestYour EGR valve?s primary purpose is to reduce emissions, so you can expect that if it?s not working correctly, your overall emissions will increase. In fact, if you have a faulty EGR valve, your vehicle will most likely fail an emissions test.You might notice slightly more smoke when the EGR valve is bad, but this isn?t very common.3. Decreased Fuel ConsumptionBad Fuel ConsumptionYour EGR valve works to send the right amount of exhaust back to the combustion chamber. One of the advantages of this is that it reduces the combustion chamber?s temperature and improves efficiency.But when the EGR valve is stuck open, the engine will suck in air that is already measured by the MAF sensor, leading to a lean air-fuel mixture and a reduction in fuel consumption. While this might sound like a great symptom, it can damage your engine.4. Reduced PowerSlow Car AccelerationNot only does an optimized engine improve fuel economy, but it also improves engine performance.You?ll notice the problem more at lower speeds if the EGR valve is stuck open and at higher speeds if the EGR valve is stuck closed.You might also notice that your acceleration has become jerky or rough.5. Rough IdleLow Idle RpmIf your EGR valve is stuck open, then you?re going to get a rough idle, especially when your vehicle hasn?t warmed up yet. That?s because usually, the EGR valve starts in the closed position.However, if the EGR valve is stuck closed, you?ll notice more problems while idling after the engine has already warmed up. That?s because the EGR valve is typically open then as it recirculates exhaust to lower the overall temperature of the combustion chamber.6. Engine KnockKnocking EngineOne of the lesser-known perks of the EGR valve is that it actually reduces engine knocking. Keeping the combustion chamber at a lower temperature prevents the fuel from igniting before it should.While this won?t always happen if you have a faulty EGR valve, the chances go up dramatically if the valve is stuck closed. If you have a check engine light on for a faulty EGR valve, keep an ear out to see if you can hear any knocking.If you can, you need to make repairs immediately before any further damage occurs."
what is the EGR Valve Function ?	"The EGR valve takes specific amounts of exhaust and recirculates it back to the combustion chamber. EGR Valve stands for exhaust gas recirculation valve, which breaks down exactly what it does. Recirculating the exhaust does a few things for overall performance. First, it optimizes the fuel to air ratio without pulling in extra air from the intake.Not only that, but the exhaust has a different chemical makeup than fresh air. This different chemical makeup allows the combustion chamber to stay up to 150 degrees Celsius cooler, which produces cleaner exhaust and improves overall engine performance.Since the EGR valve runs off sensors, it knows when to open and when to close to optimize performance. But when these sensors fail or the EGR valve gets stuck, you?ll run into problems."
where the EGR Valve Location ?	"Your vehicle?s EGR valve is typically located at the top of the engine and generally connects to a pipe that runs from your exhaust. If you know what you?re looking for, the EGR valve is usually very straightforward to find and get access to.It can be hidden deep into engine bays on some models, so to say that it is always easy to locate would be a lie.Look for a metal tube coming to the top of your engine, then locate the valve that?s attached to it, and you?ve found your EGR valve in many car models! Some car models are totally integrated into the cylinder head, though, and do not have these pipes."
EGR Valve Replacement Cost ?	"The average EGR valve replacement cost is between $225 and $800, depending on the vehicle you drive and where you take it into repairs. You can expect the EGR valve to cost $150 to $400, while labor costs $75 to $400But before you jump straight to replacing the valve, see if you can?t clean it first. Start by removing the EGR valve, spraying it with a carb cleaner, and scrubbing it with a wire brush. If this works, you?ve just saved yourself a few hundred bucks!But if you narrow down your problem to the EGR valve, and cleaning it doesn?t do the trick, then there?s good news and bad news. The good news is that with even with just a little technical know-how, it?s straightforward to replace. The bad news is that the valve itself is a bit more expensive than you would expect for such a small part.While you can find an aftermarket EGR valve for some vehicles for around $50, a more typical cost is closer to $150 and $400. If you?re looking for an OEM replacement part, you?re looking to spend a little more, generally between $250 and $600.If you?re going to have a mechanic replace the part for you, labor costs often range between $75 and $400. So, while you can save a little money by doing it yourself, you?re still going to be on the hook for the majority of the cost."
how to test EGR Valve ?	"The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve is a crucial component in reducing emissions from your car's engine. Here are the steps to test the EGR valve:Locate the EGR valve: The EGR valve is usually located on the intake manifold or near the throttle body.Check the vacuum hoses: Inspect the vacuum hoses connected to the EGR valve for cracks, leaks, or loose connections. Replace or repair any damaged hoses as necessary.Start the engine: Start the engine and let it idle.Check the vacuum signal: Use a vacuum gauge to check the vacuum signal to the EGR valve. There should be no vacuum at idle, and the vacuum should increase as the throttle is opened. If there is no vacuum signal, check the vacuum hoses and the EGR solenoid valve.Check the EGR valve operation: With the engine running, use a hand-held vacuum pump to apply vacuum to the EGR valve. The engine should idle roughly and may even stall if the EGR valve is working properly. If there is no change in engine idle, the EGR valve may be faulty.Check for carbon buildup: Remove the EGR valve and inspect it for carbon buildup or other blockages. Clean the valve and intake manifold as necessary.Test the EGR valve with a scan tool: Use a scan tool that can communicate with the PCM to test the EGR valve. The scan tool can command the PCM to open and close the EGR valve and check the feedback signal from the EGR position sensor.Replace the EGR valve: If the EGR valve fails any of the above tests, it may need to be replaced.If you are not comfortable testing the EGR valve yourself, it is best to take your car to a qualified mechanic for this test."
What is a Vapor Lock in a Car Engine?	"A vapor lock occurs when the liquefied fuel gets too hot and vaporizes. With vaporized fuel in the system, it starts to run lean, preventing the proper amount of gas from reaching the engine. Vapor lock most often happens with older models that contain a carburetor and mechanical fuel pump. The reason carbureted vehicles suffer the most is because of the setup. Overall, it runs at lower pressure and the pump is found away from the gas tank, creating more space for a vapor lock to occur. With the fuel-injected engine, the pump is found in the gas tank. The pump runs cool because it is in the fuel and the system remains pressurized, ensuring there is less likelihood of a vapor lock."
What Causes A Vapor Lock?	"Vapor lock is caused when your car?s fuel gets too hot and vaporizes. If the outside temperature are high or the engine is running at higher temperatures and the fuel lines are routed too close to the exhaust, a vapor lock can occur.It can also happen when driving at higher altitudes or if you run a winter fuel blend in your vehicle once the weather gets warm. "
what are the Symptoms Vapor Lock ?	"The most common symptom of a vapor lock is a hard starting engine. You may also notice issues like a misfiring engine or performance issues like slow acceleration or rough idle.Here is a more detailed list of the most common symptoms of a vapor lock:1. Hard Starting EngineStarting CarThe engine needs several things to run correctly, one of which is fuel. The engine requires a perfectly balanced air-to-fuel ratio to run correctly. This combination works with the compression and spark to get the motor running.If the vehicle suffers from a vapor lock, it will create an interruption to the fuel delivery. Without the right amount of fuel, the engine can be hard to start. You might notice more trouble when you try to start the vehicle after it has been warmed up.2. MisfiresMisfiresAfter the engine is running, it still needs the right air-to-fuel ratio to remain working as intended. However, a vapor lock interrupts this supply, causing the engine to run lean.When an engine runs lean, it is susceptible to misfiring because of the incomplete combustion taking place. Not only will the engine run rough, but it could stall in bad vapor lock situations. 3. Poor PerformanceSlow AccelerationWhen the engine doesn?t get enough fuel, it?s referred to as being starved. Just as we don?t perform well without food (fuel), the car isn?t going to run correctly without its power source.Vapor lock situations lead to poor acceleration and hesitation, even if you are pushing hard on the gas pedal. You might also notice a drop in fuel efficiency because of the malfunctioning operation."
what are the Steps to Avoid Vapor Lock  ?	"1. Use a Heat ShieldHeat shields don?t cost a lot and can be simple to install. This aftermarket accessory keeps the heat away from the fuel lines and other fuel-related parts.In general, it?s the chosen method when trying to prevent vapor lock. Plus, you can use excess material on other parts of the vehicle. Use heat shields where possible to protect the fuel lines.2. Install Electric FanWith an aftermarket electric fan, you can help reduce the risk. With cooling fans running automatically, you can effectively lower the engine heat. Because we know that this heat leads to vapor lock, any way to reduce it helps. Plus, if you can keep the fuel lines cooler, the engine should keep running as it should. 3. Add Electric Fuel PumpIf you put a low-pressure electric fuel pump in the system, you can help prevent vapor lock. When the original mechanical fuel pump gets too hot, it?s time to make some modifications to the system.This isn?t an easy step and might require the help of a qualified technician to get the job done. However, it should reduce the heat from the system, thereby preventing vapor lock.4. Add a New Fuel LineThe fuel line gets blocked because of the excessive heat, preventing fuel from entering the chamber. If you add a new fuel line, you might be able to avoid the problem.When you add a new fuel line, you want to make sure it has as much insulation as possible. After all, changing it out with the same fuel line isn?t going to solve anything. 5. Use a Longer Carburetor Fuel LineInstalling a longer line from the fuel system to the carburetor can also help. A longer line takes more time to heat up, so the longer, the better. Don?t forget to insulate it as well. If the line doesn?t heat up, the fuel won?t vaporize and get blocked up. This step can keep the engine running better and more efficiently. "
Cost to Fix Vapor Lock ?	"For the most part, you can fix a vapor lock situation without the help of a professional repair shop. Start by putting cold water on the fuel lines and fuel pump. Make sure the ignition is off. As the pump and lines cool down, the fuel condenses back into liquid form, making it easier to start the engine. You can also turn the key on and try to start the vehicle while you push down on the gas pedal. However, you don?t want to push the pedal all the way to the floor, or you will send an excessive amount of fuel into the system, further making it difficult to start. You should also keep the accelerator down until you get the vehicle running normally. At first, the engine might sputter when it gets started, but you should hear additional smoothness as the vapor lock gets cleared up. If you continue to deal with a vapor lock situation and can?t figure out how to repair it, you should consult with a professional."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Timing Belt ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad or failing timing belt center on performance. The engine may misfire, or there could be a lack of power. Additionally, you might hear a ticking sound, see the Check Engine Light or have issues with the exhaust. In extreme cases, the engine won?t turn over at all. As a maintenance task, you can avoid timing belt issues before problems get worse by looking at the most common symptoms. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing timing belt to look for:1. Poor Engine PerformancePoor performance is a strong symptom of a failing timing belt. Because the timing belt is needed to keep everything running in sync, any issues can lead to performance trouble. If the engine misfires, you are looking at the timing of the valves being off, which can be created by a bad timing belt. As the timing belt wears, it affects the rate that your engine is firing at. It can also slip on the camshaft, leading to the cylinders opening or closing before they should. Even if the engine isn?t misfiring yet, you might notice it just isn?t performing the way it once did. These early warning signs should be looked at before engine damage occurs.2. Ticking NoiseEngine noises should never be ignored. If you notice a ticking sound coming from the engine bay, it could be a symptom of a worn timing belt. A timing belt gets attached through pulleys that run the engine?s camshaft and crankshaft. While the crankshaft is responsible for powering the connecting rods, the camshaft is needed to operate the valves on the cylinder heads. Any interruption in this operation because of a defective timing belt can cause ticking.3. Exhaust SmokeAny time that the car motor has to work harder than it should, you could notice more exhaust smoke. This symptom indicates that the engine is facing duress, requiring your immediate attention.Additionally, bad timing can also lead to air coming into the system at the wrong times or an imbalance in the fuel-air ratio. Either of these problems can also create more exhaust smoke. 4. Check Engine LightWhenever there?s a malfunction with the engine or its vital components, the Check Engine Light will illuminate on your dashboard. If there?s an issue with the camshaft or crankshaft timing, a correlating code should set, causing you to receive an alert.If you notice this check engine light together with any of the other symptoms, it could be a strong sign that something is wrong with the timing belt.In extreme cases, the Check Engine Light could flash, indicating that you should stop driving the vehicle immediately. If you have an OBDII scanner, you can pull the codes to see what?s wrong with the engine. Otherwise, you will want to visit your local mechanic or auto parts store to have the codes read. 5. Engine Doesn?t Turn OverIf the timing belt isn?t replaced before it breaks completely, the engine won?t turn over. If the engine doesn?t start after turning the key, it could be due to the timing belt. In this case, the starter motor should still attempt to engage, but no ignition will occur and this would be a strong sign of a broken timing belt. The belt is responsible for timing the crankshaft and camshaft, so ignition cannot occur without it. In some cases, the timing belt breaks while you are driving. If this happens, additional damage can occur to the valves, rocker arms or push rods.If your car suddenly dies while driving and won?t start afterward, it could be a symptom of a broken belt. Especially if it sounds like the starter is spinning faster than it usually does when starting the vehicle."
where the Timing Belt Location ?	"Your car?s timing belt is found inside the timing cover. The belt is located near the front of the engine and is constructed from rubber. If you notice a heavy-duty metal construction instead, your car uses a timing chain.The timing belt is an essential component for normal engine operation. The car engine cannot run properly without a reliable timing belt. "
what is the Timing Belt Function ?	"The car?s timing belt is linked to both the crankshaft and camshaft. The crankshaft is needed to regulate the positioning of the engine?s pistons while the camshaft opens and closes the motor?s valves. It could also be needed to operate several other moving components on the engine, such as the oil pump and water pump. The rubber belt contains hard teeth needed to interlock with cogwheels on the various engine parts. "
How Often Should the Timing Belt Be Replaced?	"Replacing the timing belt is considered part of normal maintenance. You can find the exact interval in your owner?s manual. However, most manufacturers recommend replacing it every 75,000 to 100,000 miles or if issues arise before that. The timing chain design can last longer because it is heavy-duty, sometimes as long as up to 120,000 miles. You should never put off replacing the timing belt. If it breaks because of a lack of maintenance, you could need an engine replacement or rebuild, which is much more costly. "
wha is the Timing Belt Replacement Cost ?	"The timing belt replacement cost averages between $250 and $1000 total. The belt and related parts should only cost you $30 to $500, but labor can add much more to the bill. In fact, the labor to replace a timing belt could easily cost you $225 to $500 because of how much time is required to complete the job. During the timing belt replacement, you may also put a new water pump on because of the location. This job might add another $550 to the total bill, with about $200 to $300 for the part and another $250 to $300 for the labor. However, by pairing these two jobs together, you should be charged less for the labor as many of the same parts are removed for each replacement.RELATED: Average Water Pump Replacement Cost (By Car Model)The cost to replace a timing belt depends heavily on the type of vehicle you drive. If you have a compact car, you will have a lower cost than most of the vehicles containing a V6 engine. The smaller the engine is, the less labor is needed to disassemble parts. Additionally, luxury cars and imports can have more expensive parts or require a special mechanic to perform the replacement. Unless you have a lot of mechanical knowledge, it?s not recommended to complete this replacement on your own. If you don?t put the timing belt on correctly, it can lead to engine damage down the road. If you notice any of these symptoms above, you definitely want to take a look at your timing belt, before it?s too late!"
Can I drive with a broken timing belt?	"No, if the timing belt breaks while you are driving, it can cause catastrophic engine damage. The timing belt is responsible for keeping the engine?s valves in sync with the pistons and if it breaks, the valves will no longer be in sync with the pistons and will start to collide with them. This will bend or break the valves and cause serious damage to your engine. In some cases, a broken timing belt can even completely destroy an engine."
Is there any warning before the timing belt breaks?	"No. The timing belt will most likely break without warning and damage your engine. Sometimes when there is something wrong with the camshaft timing due to a bad timing belt, it will show a check engine light on your dashboard, but in most cases it will just snap and seize the engine. If you suspect that your timing belt is bad, replace it."
How long do timing belts really last?	"There is no fixed mileage or age on how long a timing belt will last, it depends on the make, model and manufacturer of the timing belt. Some timing belts need to be replaced after 40,000 miles while others last up to 150,000 miles. Check your car?s service manual for the schedule for when to replace the timing belt, and don?t drive over these miles or ages."
What happens if your timing belt breaks?	"If your timing belt breaks, you will likely experience engine failure. The timing belt is responsible for ensuring that the engine?s valves open and close at the correct time. When the timing belt snaps, the valves can collide with the pistons, causing extensive damage to the engine. In many cases, a broken timing belt will cause the engine to seize up completely."
how to test Timing Belt ?	"The timing belt is an important component of your car's engine, responsible for synchronizing the rotation of the crankshaft and camshaft. Here are the steps to test the timing belt:Check the maintenance schedule: Consult your car's maintenance schedule to determine the recommended interval for replacing the timing belt. It is typically recommended to replace the timing belt every 60,000 to 100,000 miles.Inspect the timing belt: Visually inspect the timing belt for signs of wear or damage. Look for cracks, frayed edges, or missing teeth. If the timing belt shows any of these signs, it should be replaced immediately.Check for tension: Check the tension of the timing belt by pressing down on the longest run between the camshaft and crankshaft sprockets with your thumb. The timing belt should not deflect more than half an inch.Check for alignment: Check the alignment of the timing belt by using a straight edge to check that the sprockets are in line with each other.Check for noise or vibration: Start the engine and listen for any abnormal noise or vibration. A noisy or vibrating timing belt may indicate a problem with the timing belt tensioner, idler pulley, or sprockets.Replace the timing belt: If the timing belt shows signs of wear or damage, or if the tension is too loose or too tight, it should be replaced. It is recommended to replace the timing belt and related components such as the tensioner, idler pulley, and water pump as a complete kit.It is important to note that a failed timing belt can cause serious engine damage, so it is best to follow the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule and replace the timing belt at the appropriate interval. If you are not comfortable testing the timing belt yourself, it is best to take your car to a qualified mechanic for this test."
what are the Symptoms Bent Connecting Rod ?	"The main symptoms of a bent connecting rod include:Low engine compressionRod knockBent or Damaged RodLow Oil PressureSeized EngineHere?s a more detailed list of the signs of a bent connecting rod to look for:1. Low Engine CompressionCompression TestAt first, a slightly bent connecting rod might not provide any noticeable symptoms. However, as it continues to bend, it will lead to a lack of compression in that cylinder. To determine if a bent rod is the culprit, a compression test needs to be performed. If the compression test shows that the cylinders are all within 10% of one another, there probably isn?t anything wrong with the rods. Instead, you will need to move forward with a leak test for further diagnosis. 2. Rod KnockingThe term ?rod knock? is enough to get you shaking in your boots, and it should. If you hear a knocking sound from the engine while it is running, it could be an indication of trouble with the connecting rods. This repeated sound will increase in speed as the engine load becomes greater. After a little while, the noise might disappear. This happens when the oil has circulated through the motor and caused more lubrication. Even though the sound is gone, for now, it will return the next time you start the engine if the connecting rod or bearing is to blame. 3. Bent or Damaged RodUnless you are physically inspecting the engine, this isn?t the easiest defect to notice. To visually inspect the rods, you must disassemble the engine.However, if the engine is being worked on or it is being rebuilt, the mechanic should perform an inspection of the connecting rods. Thankfully, if there is a problem, it is much easier to replace a bent rod while the engine is already apart.4. Low Oil PressureWhen the connecting rod goes bad or fails, the engine is going to lose oil quickly. This sudden change will alter the oil pressure. You can spot the dropping pressure on the oil gauge located on your dashboard. There may also be a warning light that comes on when the pressure drops. You should never drive your car with low oil pressure. The lack of lubrication could cause an overheated motor, which means additional repair costs. 5. Seized EngineThrown rods are known for stalling or seizing the engine. It?s not hard to know when the engine has seized, because you won?t be able to turn it over by hand with a wrench on the crankshaft pulley bolt. In normal situations, you would be able to turn the engine by hand if it isn?t starting. Thrown rods also create a loud banging noise or metal that flies out of the engine. This defect can lead to a huge hole in the engine block and a massive puddle of oil underneath the vehicle. "
what are the Connecting Rod Failure Causes ?	"The most common causes of a bent connecting rod are detonation or over-revving. If you know you have been driving in deep water it could have flooded your engine, leading to hydro-lock which will easily bend your connecting rods.Here?s a more detailed list of the causes of a bent connecting rod:1. Flooded EngineFlooded EngineAir is compressible, but liquid is not. When the engine gets filled with fluid instead of air, it leads to hydro-lock. When the engine is hydro-locked, it is at risk of a bent connecting rod at the time the vehicle starts. To ensure this doesn?t happen, you must remove the water from the engine before you turn it on. 2. Pre-ignition or DetonationThese terms both indicate that combustion is occurring abnormally. The air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber must ignite and detonate at particular intervals for reliable performance.However, several issues lead to pre-ignition and detonation, such as using a lower octane rating fuel, carbon build-up and advanced ignition timing. Each of these events leads to cylinder pressures that are abnormal, which can cause a rod to bend or break. 3. Over RevvingWhen the engine revs higher, more force is exerted on the connecting rods because the pistons have increased speed. If you rev your car engine higher than it was meant to be, you could be looking at needing a replacement.Some modern engines have safety measures built in to prevent over-revving. As you move beyond the redline, fuel might be cut to prevent damage. In many cases, this damage occurs with manual transmission vehicles that don?t have fail-safes. When you downshift into a gear that?s too low, you might force the RPMs to rise too high, leading to catastrophic failure. 4. Adding ModificationsIf you are adding engine optimizers or other parts to your vehicle, you might need to perform a tuning to keep the engine running right. Otherwise, you are pushing the engine beyond what its limits are, which might cause a thrown rod.Additionally, extra care should be taken when you install a new intake, boost controller, turbo or exhaust. You must account for this new hardware and properly tune the engine if you don?t want to damage the connecting rods. "
where the Connecting Rod Location ?	"The connecting rod is an integral part of the internal combustion engine. It is mounted to the crankshaft and connected with a bearing.A connecting rod bearing cap is found bolted to the large end. Most connecting rods are hollow and can be constructed of several materials, including micro-alloyed steel, high-grade aluminum, sintered metals or titanium and CFRP."
what is The Function of connecting rod ?	"The connecting rod is responsible for creating a linkage between the crankshaft and piston where it can transmit power. These rods convert linear up and down motion from the piston into the circular movement of the car?s crankshaft. The connecting rod contains bearings sitting between the crankshaft and the rod. These bearings prevent metal from rubbing against metal, and ensure proper lubrication while the crankshaft rotates. There is also a pin connecting the top of the connecting rod to the piston. This pin is often referred to as the gudgeon pin, piston pin or wrist pin. Connecting rods endure a lot of stress and tension, which leads to increased weakness. If it becomes weak, it won?t be able to handle the pressure from combustion and could break or bend. This defect leads to engine failure because the damaged connecting rod causes trouble with the power strokes, compression strokes, exhaust strokes and intake strokes. "
what is the Connecting Rods Replacement Cost ?	"Replacing a bent connecting rod will cost $3,000 or more for parts and labor. However, some vehicles are going to require a complete engine replacement, especially if it has a thrown connecting rod. Additionally, the cost to repair luxury cars and larger models can sometimes reach $5,000 or more."
How to Add Horsepower and Torque to a Car?	"The easiest way to add horsepower and torque to a car is by doing a performance chip tuning to your ECM. You can also install a cold air intake or install a bigger exhaust system to get even more power.Here are some more detailed steps on how to add horsepower to your car:1. Install Cold Air IntakeCold Air IntakeCold air is dense air. When the air is colder, there is more of it per volume. It?s the same condition you see when you take a balloon into the colder air. However, you can use this concept to your advantage with engine performance. The denser the air is, the more of it will enter the motor. As more air molecules mix with the fuel, you will notice more power. Basically, the better the engine is breathing air, the more power potential there is to enjoy.With a high-performance cold air intake, you ensure that massive amounts of cold air are pulled into the engine. In some cases, cold air intakes can pull in three times the amount of air compared with factory intakes. 2. Flash the ComputerWith a simple device, it?s easy to reprogram your vehicle?s computer. Some models even include pre-set configurations for more horsepower, increased torque, or for a more efficient operation. Depending on which tuner you use, you can gain a lot of horsepowers.However, recent laws have begun cracking down on some of these systems because they alter fuel efficiency and emissions. You will need to do some research to determine which ECU tuner is appropriate for your application. This can be very cost-efficient, especially if you have a turbo car. Then you can often expect gains of 10-50 horsepower from one tune at a price of $100 to $800.3. Add High-Performance Exhaust SystemInstall Exhaust SystemThe exhaust system needs to be functional for maximum performance. An exhaust system contains everything from the engine back, including the headers or exhaust manifold, the downpipe, a resonator, the catalytic converter and a muffler.You can upgrade all of these parts or just one, depending on your budget. With a free-flowing exhaust system, you gain piping with a larger diameter. This design ensures that your car expels exhaust faster, allowing it to inhale oxygen sooner. The longer this process takes, the more power reduction you will notice. 4. Install a SuperchargerSuperchargerSuperchargers benefit the power and torque of your car engine similar to the way the cold air intake does. However, the supercharger is compressing the fuel and air to boost power by over 50% in some cases. Superchargers have several benefits over the turbocharger. Because it is a belt-driven design, it works best on six-cylinder motors. Plus, you don?t need to install an intercooler, so there are fewer components to break. Additionally, the supercharger is easier to install than the turbocharger in most cases. However, they aren?t cheap. You will need to pay for this kind of instant power that?s received when you push on the accelerator. 5. Install a TurbochargerTurbochargerThe supercharger receives its power from the belt that connects to the engine, while the turbo receives power from the gases moving through the exhaust. Because the turbocharger recycles energy, it?s considered to be an extremely efficient upgrade. However, turbochargers are also subject to what?s known as a lag or delay. Additionally, you might only achieve an estimated 25% horsepower increase with a turbo, which is less than with a supercharger. 6. Add a Nitrous KitNitrous became popular with the Fast & Furious franchise, but it?s been around for far longer. Basically, the nitrous kit operates as a portable turbo or supercharger, allowing you to transfer it between various vehicles with ease.Nitrous is found in a can that makes more air. As with the air intake, the more air pumped into the engine, the more power you will notice. However, some states have banned the use of NOS kits, making them illegal to use. They can also cost anywhere from $900 to $3,000, so you will spend a lot to get one installed. With that said, you can combine a nitrous kit with your supercharger or turbocharger for maximum power. 7. Install a Performance CamshaftThe camshaft is responsible for the timing and duration of the valve openings. By changing this function and the timing, you can boost acceleration and horsepower from the car engine.A high-performance cam allows you to achieve the changes you want. However, this isn?t a cheap upgrade and it is going to make your engine louder, which isn?t always a negative factor. 8. Perform a Tune-UpThe easiest way to boost horsepower and improve performance is to perform regular tune-ups. If the car has old, defective parts, the engine isn?t going to be optimized. Start with regular oil changes. As the oil gets dirty and contaminated, it allows more friction to occur. Not only does this harm the performance, but it causes more wear to the engine. Conventional oil should be changed every 3,000 miles, while many synthetic oils last up to 10,000 miles. Don?t forget to change the oil filter at the same time.While we are on the subject of filters, you want to change the air filter as well. If the engine can?t breathe, you can?t expect it to output the maximum horsepower.Finally, if you are noticing performance issues, you want to check the spark plugs. New spark plugs are essential to creating more performance, which is why you should consider upgrading to iridium over the factory copper plugs that were installed. While these maintenance tasks aren?t going to create more horsepower beyond factory specifications, they will ensure that your engine is producing everything it is capable of."

With a free-flowing exhaust system, you gain piping with a larger diameter. This design ensures that your car expels exhaust faster, allowing it to inhale oxygen sooner. The longer this process takes, the more power reduction you will notice. 4. Install a SuperchargerSuperchargerSuperchargers benefit the power and torque of your car engine similar to the way the cold air intake does. However, the supercharger is compressing the fuel and air to boost power by over 50% in some cases. Superchargers have several benefits over the turbocharger. Because it is a belt-driven design, it works best on six-cylinder motors. Plus, you don?t need to install an intercooler, so there are fewer components to break. Additionally, the supercharger is easier to install than the turbocharger in most cases. However, they aren?t cheap. You will need to pay for this kind of instant power that?s received when you push on the accelerator. 5. Install a TurbochargerTurbochargerThe supercharger receives its power from the belt that connects to the engine, while the turbo receives power from the gases moving through the exhaust. Because the turbocharger recycles energy, it?s considered to be an extremely efficient upgrade. However, turbochargers are also subject to what?s known as a lag or delay. Additionally, you might only achieve an estimated 25% horsepower increase with a turbo, which is less than with a supercharger. 6. Add a Nitrous KitNitrous became popular with the Fast & Furious franchise, but it?s been around for far longer. Basically, the nitrous kit operates as a portable turbo or supercharger, allowing you to transfer it between various vehicles with ease.Nitrous is found in a can that makes more air. As with the air intake, the more air pumped into the engine, the more power you will notice. However, some states have banned the use of NOS kits, making them illegal to use. They can also cost anywhere from $900 to $3,000, so you will spend a lot to get one installed. With that said, you can combine a nitrous kit with your supercharger or turbocharger for maximum power. 7. Install a Performance CamshaftThe camshaft is responsible for the timing and duration of the valve openings. By changing this function and the timing, you can boost acceleration and horsepower from the car engine.A high-performance cam allows you to achieve the changes you want. However, this isn?t a cheap upgrade and it is going to make your engine louder, which isn?t always a negative factor. 8. Perform a Tune-UpThe easiest way to boost horsepower and improve performance is to perform regular tune-ups. If the car has old, defective parts, the engine isn?t going to be optimized. Start with regular oil changes. As the oil gets dirty and contaminated, it allows more friction to occur. Not only does this harm the performance, but it causes more wear to the engine. Conventional oil should be changed every 3,000 miles, while many synthetic oils last up to 10,000 miles. Don?t forget to change the oil filter at the same time.While we are on the subject of filters, you want to change the air filter as well. If the engine can?t breathe, you can?t expect it to output the maximum horsepower.Finally, if you are noticing performance issues, you want to check the spark plugs. New spark plugs are essential to creating more performance, which is why you should consider upgrading to iridium over the factory copper plugs that were installed. While these maintenance tasks aren?t going to create more horsepower beyond factory specifications, they will ensure that your engine is producing everything it is capable of."
Symptoms Of A Bad Distributor Cap ?	"The most common symptom of a bad distributor cap is trouble starting the car during rainy or foggy weather. You may also notice a shaking or stalling engine. Squealing noises are also quite common, and you may also see a check engine warning light on your dashboard.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing distributor cap to look for:1. Trouble StartingHard StartingAs the distributor cap gets worse, you are going to have trouble starting the engine. You will notice the problem most prominently when the temperatures drop during winter. Cold weather cools the cap and can also freeze it. When you attempt to start the engine, the sudden heat can lead to cracks. To avoid this, it?s best to keep your vehicle parked in a garage during colder months. 2. ShakingIf you are experiencing intense vibrations or shaking in your car, it could be due to the distributor cap causing misfires. The problem might be most prominent when you start the car or when it is shifting gears.The shaking will feel uncontrollable, and can be felt throughout the entire vehicle. This is a major sign that the distributor cap is faulty. 3. StallingIf you can get the car started, but have trouble keeping it going, it could be due to the distributor cap. Inside the distributor, there is a rotor that spins to deliver voltage, and it must be working right to keep the vehicle running.If there is a clog or crack, it can stop the rotor from spinning. This can cause not only stalling, but backfiring, too. 4. Squealing NoisesAnother sign that the distributor cap is bad is squealing noises from the bearings inside it. This problem creates a unique tell-tale sound that can easily be distinguished from others.If you check the distributor cap, you might find a build-up of grease, dirt and other pollutants. This blockage of the air circulation is what is causing the squealing sound you hear. 5. Check Engine LightEven with an older car, you have a Check Engine Light that alerts you to trouble. However, when this light comes on, it can mean any number of issues.The best way to tell if the light is on due to the distributor cap is to evaluate the other symptoms. If the Check Engine Light comes on with other symptoms we?ve touched on, you can bet on a faulty cap. "
what is the The function of a Distributor Cap ?	"When the engine starts up, a lot of voltage is produced. This voltage moves into the ignition coil and the electrode of the distributor?s rotor. This part takes the place of the modern ignition system in vehicles.The rotor in the distributor starts to rotate, allowing power to transfer to the electrodes in the distributor cap. From here, the cap is transferring electricity to the various spark plugs with the help of the wires. This process that has been outlined occurs every time the cylinders need a spark to ignite the fuel/air mixture for combustion. Without this part functioning as it should, ignition becomes difficult, if not impossible. "
where the Distributor Cap Location ?	"You can find the distributor cap under the car hood. When you open the hood, you want to search for a black, gray, or red component made from plastic. It is normally near the center of the engine.Typically, the distributor cap looks like a crown with black or blue cables connected to spokes on the top. These black or blue cables are the spark plug wires, which are needed to transfer power to the plugs.If you can?t find the distributor cap, you can follow the spark plug wires to see where they attach. You can also check your owner?s manual to help you locate it. If the cap looks cracked or worn out when you find it, you need to replace it.  "
what is the Distributor Cap Inspection ?	"The distributor cap is an important component of the ignition system in older cars. It distributes the high-voltage electrical charge from the ignition coil to the spark plugs in the correct firing order. Over time, the distributor cap can become dirty or worn, which can cause misfires or other ignition problems. Here are the steps to inspect the distributor cap:Locate the distributor cap: The distributor cap is usually located on top of the engine, near the front.Remove the distributor cap: Use a screwdriver to remove the screws or clips holding the distributor cap in place, and carefully lift the cap off the distributor.Inspect the cap for wear: Look for signs of wear or damage, such as cracks, carbon tracks, or corrosion. If the cap is damaged or worn, it should be replaced.Check the contacts: Look inside the distributor cap for signs of wear or damage on the contacts. The contacts should be clean and shiny. If they are dirty or corroded, they can be cleaned with a soft brush or a piece of sandpaper.Check the rotor: Remove the rotor from the distributor and inspect it for signs of wear or damage, such as cracks or carbon tracks. If the rotor is damaged or worn, it should be replaced.Reinstall the distributor cap and rotor: Place the rotor back in the distributor and carefully reinstall the distributor cap, making sure it is seated securely and the screws or clips are tightened.Test the ignition system: Start the engine and check for proper ignition system operation, such as smooth engine idle and acceleration. If the engine runs rough or misfires, the distributor cap or rotor may need to be replaced.Inspecting the distributor cap is a relatively simple task that can be performed by most car owners. If you are not comfortable inspecting the distributor cap yourself, it is best to take your car to a qualified mechanic for this inspection."
Distributor Cap Replacement Cost ?	"The distributor cap replacement cost is $70 to $130 in total for parts and labor. In general, expect to pay about $25 to $60 for the parts, depending on what vehicle you drive. The other $45 to $70 will be the cost of the labor if you need a professional replacement. With some simple tools and general know-how, you can replace the distributor cap yourself and save on labor costs. However, you must be careful to label all of the spark plug wires you remove, or you could find yourself with a bigger mess on your hands than you started with. "
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad throttle position sensor (TPS) are poor acceleration, rough idle, and a check engine light on your dashboard. If you have an automatic transmission, you may also notice shifting issues. Other driveability issues are also common.Because the throttle position sensor is such an important part of the engine?s performance, it could result in many different symptoms.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing throttle position sensor (TPS) to look for:1. Poor AccelerationCar Acceleration E1609869867245One of the most common signs of a defective throttle position sensor is delayed or poor acceleration. Delayed acceleration means that there is a considerable time difference between stepping on the accelerator and the actual acceleration of the vehicle.If you also notice that the car judders when accelerating, this can be due to a damaged throttle position sensor.2. Idle SurgingCar Engine Rough Idle E1609793094987The term idling refers to the operation of the engine when the vehicle is not actually moving. If you notice that your engine fluctuates when idling, this may be due to an irregular air-fuel mixture, which is related to a faulty throttle position sensor.If the ECM does not receive correct information from the throttle position sensor, the throttle will not function correctly, resulting in idle surging.3. Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light On Dashboard E1609869927250There are several sensors in a vehicle, and if one sensor is not working, the check engine light comes on.Although the check engine light will illuminate for various other reasons, it is advisable to check the throttle sensor, especially if your car has poor acceleration and idle surging.If your check engine light is on and related to the throttle position sensor, it will most likely be a trouble code related to the sensor in the ECU. You can check it with an OBD2 scanner.4. Sudden Surge while Driving at a High SpeedDriving High Speed E1609869984178If you have an electric throttle body, one of the most dangerous effects of a defective throttle position sensor is a sudden increase in speed while driving at high speed on a highway. What happens is that the throttle in the throttle valve may close automatically, and if the driver presses the accelerator pedal too hard, the valve suddenly opens and gives the car a small speed boost.This happens if the throttle position sensor is damaged and sends an incorrect signal to the throttle valve, causing it to open and close suddenly.5. Problem with Shifting GearsGear ShifterA poor throttle position sensor causes a problem with acceleration, which in turn causes a problem with the automatic transmission.The throttle position sensor does also sends information to the automatic transmission control unit. If this information is faulty, there might also be a problem with your automatic transmission?s shiftings."
what is The function of the throttle position sensor ?	"The Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) is an integral part of the vehicle?s fuel management system as it determines the angle of the throttle body flap.The throttle position sensor transmits throttle position data to the engine control module (ECM), and this information helps determine how much fuel should be injected into the engine at the right time.The throttle position sensor can fail for a number of reasons and, as a result, affect the performance and the fuel consumption of the car, it can drop significantly."
where the Throttle position sensor location?	"The throttle position sensor is located on the throttle body since it is measuring the angle of the throttle body valve.If you can see a sensor with wires to it in the same direction as the throttle body axle, it is most likely the throttle position sensor.If you have a newer car with an electric throttle body, the throttle position sensor is most likely integrated into the throttle body and can?t be replaced separately. "
Throttle Position Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"The average throttle position sensor replacement cost is between $80 and $300, depending on the car model and labor costs. A throttle position sensor costs $30 to $100. The labor costs are usually between $50 and $200 at a workshop.If your car has an electronic throttle body, it is possible that it is not possible to replace the position sensor alone ? you have to replace the whole throttle body, which can result in an expensive cost of $100 to $900.The price of the labor cost does vary heavily depending on the car model since, in some cars, you can change it within 5 minutes, and it can take several hours on others.Remember that after you replace a throttle position sensor or the throttle body, you need to reprogram/recalculate the throttle angle. This can often only be done with the right diagnostic tools."
how to test Throttle Position Sensor?	"The throttle position sensor (TPS) is a sensor that monitors the position of the throttle valve in the engine. It helps the engine control module (ECM) to determine the amount of air and fuel to be injected into the engine. Here are the steps to test the throttle position sensor:Locate the TPS: The TPS is usually located on the throttle body, which is attached to the intake manifold of the engine.Disconnect the electrical connector: Disconnect the electrical connector from the TPS, located at the rear of the throttle body.Turn the ignition key to the ""On"" position: Turn the ignition key to the ""On"" position, but do not start the engine.Measure the voltage: Use a digital multimeter to measure the voltage between the TPS connector terminals. There should be three terminals: ground, reference, and signal. The reference voltage should be around 5 volts, and the signal voltage should vary smoothly and evenly as you slowly open and close the throttle valve.Check for voltage dropouts or spikes: Observe the multimeter readings while slowly opening and closing the throttle valve. The signal voltage should increase smoothly and evenly, without any dropouts or spikes. If you notice any dropouts or spikes, the TPS may be faulty.Test for continuity: Check for continuity between the TPS connector terminals and the wiring harness. If there is no continuity, the wiring may be faulty.Reconnect the electrical connector: Reconnect the electrical connector to the TPS.Test drive the vehicle: Take the vehicle for a test drive and check for any symptoms of a faulty TPS, such as poor acceleration or hesitation. If the symptoms persist, the TPS may need to be replaced.Testing the TPS is a relatively simple task that can be performed by most car owners. If you are not comfortable testing the TPS yourself, it is best to take your car to a qualified mechanic for this test."
what is the Car Engine Noises ?	"1. SquealingSerpentine Belt CarIs there ever a time that squealing is good, even outside of the automotive realm? If you hear a squeal coming from under the hood, it should cause alarm. Most times, this annoying sound is related to a loose or worn-out serpentine belt.This belt is responsible for controlling all of the engine accessories, such as the alternator and water pump. Because of its importance, you don?t want to ignore the need for a replacement. However, there are other reasons that your car might be squealing. If it?s not coming from the engine area, but rather when you turn, your issue might be in the steering system instead. Or, if you hear squealing when you brake, you might need new brake pads. RELATED: 7 Symptoms of a Bad Serpentine Belt2. Tapping/ClickingEngine Oil LevelThere?s a distinctive sound that the car engine makes when the oil is low. It resembles a clicking, ticking or tapping noise. Thankfully, this condition is one of the easiest to diagnose; just take a look at the dipstick.You can also resolve the issue easily by adding more oil. However, adding oil is a short-term fix. You still want to figure out why your car is low on oil in the first place. Low oil can be caused by a leak, either internally or externally, as well as conditions where it is being burned up. However, if you check the oil and everything seems fine, you might have a valvetrain problem instead. These are serious concerns that should be looked at right away. 3. GrindingDriving HighwayThere are many different car systems that can make a grinding noise, but when just focused on the engine alone, it could be due to worn-out bearings. If this is the case, you will hear the grinding sound when driving or idling.However, a grinding noise that occurs during shifting is likely a worn-out clutch instead. Grinding can also occur when taking a turn because of a bad CV joint or another suspension-related issue. Of course, the most notorious grinding sound occurs with the brakes when the pads are worn down. Once this sound occurs, you know that the brakes are down to the metal. Whether you hear grinding from the engine or other car components, it?s a serious sound that shouldn?t be taken lightly. Get your car to a local service shop right away. 4. KnockingKnocking EngineThe engine can make a distinct pinging or metallic knocking sound while driving. This condition is known as detonation knock.This occurs when the fuel and air mixture in one of the cylinders detonates at numerous locations simultaneously. It?s possible that you put the wrong octane fuel into the system, which can cause this problem. However, it can also be caused by a lean air and fuel mixture, poor timing, or a damaged knock sensor. All knocking noises need to be dealt with immediately before further engine damage occurs. 5. Loud BangingNoise From CarWe?ve all heard it once in our lives ? that distinctive explosion sound that reminds you of fireworks. This condition is known as a backfire. It occurs when the fuel wasn?t burned in the combustion chamber and escapes. Once it moves beyond the combustion chamber, it combusts in the exhaust instead. Any time the fuel/air ratio becomes too rich or lean, a backfire can occur. Allowing your car to backfire only puts it at further risk of damage. 6. Hissing/SizzlingCar Vacuum Hose LeakIf you hear a sizzling or popping sound immediately after shutting down the engine, there could be a leak. Either oil or coolant is leaking onto a hot engine component. You might see the leak on the exhaust manifold, or it could be harder to find. It could also just be a vacuum line. Either way, the problem should be addressed immediately, especially if the engine is starting to overheat. 7. PoppingThere are a number of conditions that cause popping sounds in the engine. Many of them will be accompanied by engine hesitation, affecting the performance of your car.Some of the most common reasons for engine popping include a clogged fuel filter, ignition issues, fouled or dirty spark plugs, damaged plug wires or a faulty catalytic converter. Some of these fixes are simple and low-cost, while others, such as the catalytic converter, are going to be more expensive. "
what is the engine noise Repair Costs ?	"Whatever noise you are hearing, it?s vital to have it diagnosed immediately. Otherwise, the problem could lead to irreversible engine damage. Luckily it is often enough with smaller repairs when you experience any engine noise.If the engine becomes damaged beyond repair, you are going to need a replacement. However, buying a new engine is quite expensive. For most people, it?s better to purchase a remanufactured engine. If you have a newer car, you will want the warranty that comes with a brand-new motor instead. A used engine and labor will still likely run $1,500 or more. New gas engines and installation are going to be $3,000 or more. A new Ford V10 engine costs $5,000 or more. However, there are some cars that don?t cost as much. For example, a new Ford Focus engine might only be $500 for the engine, not including the labor. If you have a diesel engine, you are looking at a much higher bill."
what are the Symptoms Of A Leaking or Bad Intake Manifold Gasket ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad intake manifold gasket are a misfiring engine and white smoke coming from the exhaust. You may also notice external coolant leaks if coolant goes through the manifold. It will also show a check engine light on your dashboard.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a leaking intake manifold gasket to look for:1. Poor Engine Performance & misfiresCar MisfiresA leaking intake manifold lets air out and coolant in. Both of these things can negatively affect performance. It?s not very likely that you won?t be able to get your vehicle started or that your engine will shut off while running, but you might notice a drop in acceleration and fuel economy.The biggest concern is that if the coolant mixes with the oil, you?re not only losing the performance of the coolant, but the oil won?t be able to function correctly either. This can lead to excessive wear on a lot of components and cause expensive damages.You may also find misfire trouble codes in the engine control unit if you check the trouble codes with a scanner.If the intake leak is very bad, it can fill up the cylinder with coolant, which will make your engine hydro lock, making it impossible to turn over. This is very serious and can cause significant damage to your car. Luckily, it is not very common. Most car engines are designed so that the coolant will pour down into the intake manifold instead.2. Excessive White Smoke from ExhaustOil Smoke Car E1609805071325When you?re looking at your intake manifold, you won?t be able to see what?s going on inside unless you tear apart your engine, and at that point, you should be replacing the intake manifold gaskets, whether they were leaking or not.That?s why it?s essential to know how to troubleshoot this problem without taking anything apart. The easiest way is to start your vehicle and take a look at the exhaust. If there is an excessive amount of white smoke coming out of the exhaust, it?s because your engine is burning coolant. The only way coolant gets into the combustion chamber is if there is either a leaking head gasket or a leaking intake manifold gasket. Either way, you have a problem. When determining if the amount of white smoke is excessive, keep in mind that you?ll have more smoke during colder weather than you will during warmer weather, and this is completely normal.3. Coolant In the Oil PanEngine Oil DipstickOne of the most common problems of a leaking intake manifold is that you?ll find coolant in the oil pan. Unfortunately, this is also one of the more serious issues. Not only are you losing out on the cooling properties of the coolant, but you?re also losing out on the lubricating properties of the oil.When you combine these two problems, you can quickly end up with a vehicle requiring extensive repairs to get back on the road. If you find coolant in the oil pan, make sure you get your vehicle to the repair shop right away. You can easily recognize the coolant in the oil pan because the oil will look milky when you check the dipstick?s oil level.4. Visible Coolant LeakCoolant Leaking E1609789888621If you have a leaking intake manifold gasket, there are a few ways the coolant can go. First, it can go into the combustion chamber, which is how you get excessive smoke, or it can mix with the oil, which is how you can get coolant in the oil reservoir. It can also run off the side of the exterior of the intake manifold.If this is the case, you might have excessive smoke coming off the top of your engine if the coolant burns off before it reaches the ground. Or, you might have a visible coolant leak on the ground underneath your vehicle. Either way, if you trace the leak back to the intake manifold, you?ve found your problem.5. Overheating EngineEngine OverheatingThe three most prominent symptoms of a leaking intake manifold involve leaking coolant. Since it?s the coolant?s job to keep your engine from overheating, it?s not surprising that if it?s not working correctly, you can get an engine that overheats.This won?t happen immediately, and it usually occurs once the system runs low on coolant. But if you have an overheating engine and can?t figure out where the coolant is going, there?s a good chance that it might be coming from a leak in the intake manifold."
what is the Intake Manifold Gasket Function?	"The intake manifold?s function is to direct the correct fluids, gasses, and engine necessities to the correct location throughout the engine. The intake manifold gasket assists with this by eliminating any potential escape routes for these fluids or gasses.The intake manifold gasket forms seals around each of the passages in the intake manifold, keeping everything where it?s supposed to be. It might not sound that complicated, and it?s not, but that doesn?t make it any less important."
where the Intake Manifold Gasket Location ?	"Your vehicle?s intake manifold gasket is located near your engine?s head between the intake manifold and the cylinder head. On V-shaped engines, it usually sits between both headers. For inline engines, it usually sits off one of the sides.Reaching your intake manifold usually isn?t too complicated, but there can be many electrical components sitting on top. Not only can this make it hard to access the intake manifold, but it can make it harder to see, too."
Intake Manifold Gasket Replacement Cost ?	"The average intake manifold gasket replacement cost is between $80 and $400, depending on the car model and labor costs. An intake manifold gasket costs $30 to $100 and labor costs $50 to $300.The intake manifold gasket itself is often quite cheap, but most of the replacement cost comes from labor costs. This is because you have to remove the whole intake manifold to reach the gasket.Sometimes the intake manifold cracks, causing it to leak near the gasket, and in this case, you can expect a cost of $200 to $800 for a new intake manifold."
Is it safe to drive with a bad intake manifold gasket?	"No. Driving with a bad intake manifold gasket can actually cause damage to your engine cylinders or other internal engine parts, depending on how large the leak is. Even if there is only a small leak, it is not good for your engine, so it is best to fix it as soon as possible."
How do I know if my intake or head gasket is leaking?	"The intake manifold gasket and head gasket serve two completely different purposes, so you?ll see different symptoms depending on which one is leaking. If your intake manifold is leaking, you will most likely notice performance issues, but if you see oil in the coolant reservoir or white smoke from the exhaust, it could be a blown head gasket."
How long does it take to replace the intake manifold gasket?	"The replacement time for an intake manifold gasket depends entirely on the car and engine model. In some cars, you can replace the intake manifold gasket in under 30 minutes, while in others, it can take several hours."
How do I know if my intake manifold gasket is leaking?	"The easiest way to know if your intake manifold is leaking is to spray some starter fluid or brake clean around the intake manifold gasket while the engine is running. If the engine speed increases, there is most likely a leak in the intake manifold gasket or an intake hose."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Motor Mount ?	"The most common symptom of a bad motor mount is noises from under the hood when releasing or depressing the accelerator pedal. You may also notice violent vibrations or unnecessary engine movements. If you open the hood and the engine is tilted, it?s also a sign.Because motor mounts are not movable parts, there are just a few common symptoms that bad engine mounts can do. Here is a more detailed list of signs of a bad or failing motor mount to look for:1. Noise from Under the HoodCheck Noise Under Hood E1609791600132The most common sign of all motor mount symptoms is that you may notice a strange noise from under the hood.The engine mounts are provided to reduce the noise of the engine. So if unnecessary noise reaches you, there can be something wrong with the engine mounts.This is especially true if you hit hard against a bump or pothole and a loud rattling can be heard in the engine compartment. If you hear such a thing, you should contact the mechanic as soon as possible, because a defective engine mount can cause great damage if it is not repaired in time.2. Violent VibrationsEngine Mount Vibration E1609791592823The engine mount is intended to dampen and reduce the vibrations of an ignited engine. So if you feel more vibrations inside the car than usual, there is probably something wrong with the rubber in your engine mounts. Rubber is a component that can wear out due to friction and extreme stress. The engine exerts both on the engine mounts, so it?s only natural that the rubber wears out, causing its vital functions to be affected.3. Unnecessary Engine MovementCar Engine Movements E1609791582981This symptom will not be easily noticed. You may accidentally come across it when you open the hood to fill coolant into the radiator, or you may notice it after the other two symptoms appear. If the seal on the engine mounts loosens, the engine will begin to shake and vibrate violently. This movement can become even more violent if you press the gas and try to accelerate. The torque generated by the engine will further destroy the engine mounts, forcing you to make repairs as soon as possible.4. Engine is tiltedTilted Car Engine E1609791564454If you open the hood and see that the engine is tilted to one side, it may sign that one engine mount is broken. Remember that some engines are fitted tilted from the factory to be sure of this symptom, you can google your car and the model to find pictures of how it should look like.5. Engine jumps at idleEngine Jump Idle E1609791573302If your engine jumps at idle when you open your hood, it can be because of bad motor mounts. Just remember that a jumping engine on idle can mean many things, and it?s not sure that it is because of a bad engine mount, but it can be a sign of it."
What is a Motor Mount?	"The engine is the heart of a car, and without it, a car is completely useless. To keep the car?s heart in place, you need strong connections that won?t let the engine fall to the ground. These connections are called engine mounts, and they are responsible for keeping the engine firmly in place.Motor mounts come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have the same task: to prevent engine vibrations from spreading to the rest of the car. For this reason, engine mounts are made from a combination of metal and rubber. The metal is responsible for withstanding the engine?s weight and keeping it in place even when the engine is exerting extreme torque.On the other hand, the rubber part is responsible for reducing the vibrations that can occur elsewhere. After understanding the functions of an engine mount, it should be clear that some symptoms can occur due to engine mount failure."
where the Motor mount location ?	The engine mounts are located on each side of the engine and most often a third one on the opposite side to reduce the engine?s twisting on acceleration.You often have to look from under the car to find them because they are most often installed on the engine?s bottom but can be in the top in some rear cases.
what is the Motor Mount Replacement Cost ?	"The average engine mount replacement cost is between $100 and $700, depending on the car model and labor costs. An Engine mount costs between $50 and $200. For a typical replacement of the engine mount, the mechanic will charge you about $50 to $500 in labor costs.Remember that the cost of repair is directly proportional to the make and model of your car and the availability of the part.Your mechanic has to lift the engine with a pulley and chain and keep it lifted while he inspects and replaces the motor mount. Even with such a small thing as an inspection, your mechanic must lift your car and look under the engine mount. Given the nature of this operation, the mechanic will ask you for a lot of money for most car models."
how to test Motor Mount  ?	"Motor mounts are essential components that help to hold the engine in place and reduce the amount of vibration and noise that it produces. Here are the steps to test the motor mounts:Park the vehicle on a flat surface: Park the vehicle on a flat surface, engage the parking brake, and turn off the engine.Locate the motor mounts: Locate the motor mounts by referring to the vehicle's owner's manual or by inspecting the engine compartment. Most cars have at least two motor mounts: one on the driver's side and one on the passenger side.Visually inspect the motor mounts: Visually inspect the motor mounts for any signs of wear or damage, such as cracks or tears in the rubber or metal components. If any damage is found, the motor mounts should be replaced.Check for engine movement: Start the engine and observe the movement of the engine when the transmission is shifted into gear. The engine should not move excessively or shift position when the transmission is shifted. If the engine moves excessively, it may indicate a worn or damaged motor mount.Apply the brakes and press the accelerator: Apply the brakes and press the accelerator pedal. Observe the engine for excessive movement or vibrations. If the engine moves excessively or vibrates excessively, it may indicate a worn or damaged motor mount.Inspect the motor mount bolts: Inspect the bolts that secure the motor mount to the engine and the frame of the vehicle. Make sure they are tight and not missing. If the bolts are loose or missing, the motor mount may be damaged.Perform a bounce test: With the engine off, open the hood and locate the motor mount. Have someone sit in the driver's seat and bounce the car by shifting the weight back and forth between the brake and gas pedals. Observe the movement of the motor mount. If the motor mount is worn or damaged, it will move excessively.Testing the motor mounts is a relatively simple task that can be performed by most car owners. If you are not comfortable testing the motor mounts yourself, it is best to take your car to a qualified mechanic for this test."
Reasons Why Your Starter Is Not Engaging ?	"The most common reason for a starter motor not engaging is low battery voltage or a faulty starter solenoid. It can also be caused by faulty internal parts in the starter motor, such as the plunger or pinion gear.There could be many other reasons causing your starter not to engage properly, but generally speaking, it will be an internal issue with the starter motor. Here is a more detailed list of the 5 most common causes why your starter won?t engage.1. Low battery voltageBad Car BatteryWhen you are experiencing battery problems, the first culprit is your battery voltage, so you should check this first. The battery powers the starter, and if it is not working, the starter will fail to engage completely.Charge your car battery fully. You can even try to replace the car battery if you have another one you know works. You can also try jump-starting your car from the car battery of another car if you have the knowledge.Next, check out whether your battery terminals are corroded. For this, you will notice a whitish or greenish substance on the terminals.If you notice any corrosion on the battery terminals, you should remove the battery cable clamps and remove the terminals carefully.2. Starter solenoidStarter SolenoidThe starter solenoid is located on top of the starter. When you turn the key, it is the starter solenoid that pushes a plunger inside the starter motor, pushing the pinion toward the flywheel.Use a jumper wire to ground the solenoid to a bolt. Start the ignition and listen for sounds coming from the solenoid. If the click is loud and solid, then the solenoid is working fine, but if you hear a weak click, then recheck the wiring between the solenoid and starter. Electrical wires can, with time, become dirty, loose, and broken.3. Starter motor Plunger or PinionStarter Motor DiagramIf your starter solenoid seems to be fine, there might be another problem inside the starter motor. The parts that can accomplish this are the starter plunger or the starter pinion.It is time to dismantle the starter and check inside for the pinion gears. These are often placed at the front of the starter. The pinion gears engage the flywheel in firing up your engine.With time, these gears get worn out and cause problems with the starter engaging. It is time to purchase a new piston gear if it moves in both directions when you try to rotate it.4. Faulty wirings to the starterCorrosion On CableThere may also be a situation where the starter gets enough electricity to make a sound, but not enough to actually turn the starter. This can happen if there is a bad starter cable between the car battery and the starter or corrosion at any connection.Clean all connections, both at the starter and the battery, to ensure there is no bad connection. You can often locate bad connections by feeling the cable connection; it will create a lot of heat if there is a bad connection.5. Flywheel damagesCar FlywheelYou can identify the flywheel as the large wheel that is located between the engine and transmission. The starter pinion gears engage it to start the engine. What you should be looking for in a faulty flywheel are worn or damaged gears.While the car is in neutral, rotate the crankshaft using a ratchet. As you move it, watch the behavior of the flywheel. You will need to replace it if you notice that the gears are damaged.It would rarely happen suddenly; it is more common to have the wrong flywheel installed on the car."
how to test Starter in the car ?	"The starter motor is responsible for cranking the engine when the ignition key is turned. Here are the steps to test the starter motor:Turn off all accessories: Turn off all accessories such as the radio, air conditioner, and headlights.Check the battery: Check the battery voltage using a voltmeter. The battery should have at least 12.6 volts when the engine is not running. If the battery voltage is low, the starter motor may not have enough power to crank the engine.Turn the ignition key: Turn the ignition key to the ""Start"" position. If you hear a clicking sound or nothing happens, the starter motor may be faulty.Check the starter solenoid: Locate the starter solenoid, usually attached to the starter motor or nearby on the engine block. Use a screwdriver to jump the solenoid's terminals. If the starter motor cranks the engine, the solenoid may be faulty.Check the starter relay: Locate the starter relay, usually in the engine compartment or fuse box. Remove the relay and use a voltmeter to test for continuity between the relay terminals. If there is no continuity, the relay may be faulty.Inspect the starter motor: Visually inspect the starter motor for any signs of wear or damage, such as a cracked or corroded casing. If any damage is found, the starter motor should be replaced.Test the starter motor: Use a starter motor tester or a jumper wire to connect the positive terminal of the battery to the starter motor's terminal. If the starter motor cranks the engine, it is functioning properly. If the starter motor does not crank the engine, it may be faulty.Testing the starter motor is a relatively simple task that can be performed by most car owners. If you are not comfortable testing the starter motor yourself, it is best to take your car to a qualified mechanic for this test."
Why does my starter spin but not engage the flywheel?	"If your starter motor spins but does not engage the flywheel, it could be due to a faulty starter solenoid or a bad car battery. It can also be due to other faulty internal parts of the starter motor, such as the pinion gear."
How do you manually engage a starter?	"To manually engage a starter motor, you must power the starter solenoid and the starter motor connections. The easiest way to do this is to bridge the connection between the power cable and the starter solenoid. This will spin the motor, though, so be careful!"
Where to hit a starter to make it work?	"If you suspect the starter motor is bad, you can give it a small hit on the starter solenoid first to see if it starts the starter motor. If that doesn?t work, you can also hit the starter motor itself. Be careful while doing this, since the motor can suddenly turn over."
Will a jump help a bad starter?	"A jump can help a bad starter in some cases, because of the higher voltage the starter motor will get. In most cases, a bad starter won?t turn over just because you give it more power, but it might be worth a try."
Reasons Why Your Alternator Is Not Charging ?	"The most common reason why an alternator is not charging the battery is due to worn carbon brushes or a damaged alternator itself. It can also be caused by a blown fuse or bad wiring. Your alternator will also not charge the battery if the serpentine belt has snapped off.Now that you know the most common reasons in brief, you?ll probably want to read about them in greater detail. Here is a list of the 5 most common reasons why your alternator is not charging the battery.1. Worn out carbon brushes or damaged alternatorAlternator CarThe most common reason why your car is not charging the battery is actually because of a worn-out or damaged alternator.You can carefully tap it with a hammer while the car engine is running while checking it with a multimeter on the car battery to see if the voltage is within the charging range.If the voltage changes and go back to normal when you tap it lightly with a hammer while the car is running, that means the carbon brushes are worn out and need to be replaced in the alternator. Alternatively, you could replace the entire alternator.Sometimes there is an electrical problem in the alternator, and even if the voltage does not change, it might be damaged.Another common cause is bad diodes or a voltage regulator. Replacing either of these generally requires you to have more advanced knowledge about alternators.Replacing parts inside the alternator, such as carbon brushes, the diode plate, or the voltage regulator, was more common on older cars. These days, alternators are quite cheap, so it is usually cheaper to replace the whole thing than it is to fix a problem internal to the alternator.If you have already replaced it with a brand new alternator, but it?s still not charging the battery, you should keep reading this list.2. Broken Serpentine beltSerpentine Belt ComponentsA closer observation of the alternator will reveal a pulley and belt system that works to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.The serpentine belt powers the alternator. If it fails, the alternator will stop working the moment your belt wears out and breaks, or the pulley becomes damaged.This can also happen if the serpentine belt is not tightened correctly. Most cars have automatic tensioners, but these can fail, so it is better to double-check.Some older cars have manual tensioners, and in this case, you might have to tighten the serpentine belt. The serpentine belt and pulleys are often pretty easy and cheap to replace.3. Faulty fuseFuse Box CarThere is often a huge fuse connected to the alternator?s big power cable. It is often an 80A fuse or more, and is most often found in your car?s fuse box in the engine bay.Fuses blow due to a power surge, or they wear out. When this happens, the current will stop flowing from the alternator. The solution is to check your car?s manual for the particular fuse that controls the alternator, and replace it.In some cars, you might also find another small fuse to the alternator?s control?usually a 15A to 20A fuse.4. Wiring issues or connectorsCorrosion On CableA properly functioning alternator usually has three or four wires to it. You will find one big main cable together with two or three small ones.All of these wires are important for the alternator?s function, and if one breaks off, you might lose the charging function.Check the big power cable connectors between the alternator and the car battery to ensure there is no corrosion there. The cable will usually get warm if there is a bad connection somewhere.Check or measure these wires with a multimeter. Remember that measuring them is not always correct, because you have to load test wires that are half broken or have a bad connection.You should usually have 12 volts on one of these wires, and the other one goes to the battery light on the dashboard. If you have a third one, it does often go to the engine control unit. To measure this properly, you need a wiring diagram of your specific car model.5. Damaged car batteryCar Battery And AlternatorThe alternator and the car?s battery work hand in hand. A really bad car battery might not take charge from the alternator at all. In this case, it is the battery ? not the alternator ? which is the source of your problem.In theory, a car can run only with the alternator power, but this can cause heavy voltage spikes and other strange symptoms, so this means that a bad car battery can cause an alternator to not charge also.6. Engine control module errorEngine Control UnitCars are increasingly being equipped with modern electronics. In this regard, the engine control unit (ECU) controls most of the car?s electrical components.Modern cars also control the alternator. In some rare cases, there might be a problem with the engine control module not controlling the alternator?s charging.Check for any trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner to determine if anything is any other damaged part that prevents it from charging.In some rare cases, there might actually be a faulty engine control unit, but you should always check all other possible causes first."
Diagnosing an alternator that won?t charge ?	"There are some easy steps you can go through to check the function of your alternator.Tap the alternator carefully with a hammer while the engine is running; if the charging goes back to normal, the carbon brushes inside it are worn out and need a replacement.Check the large power cable to the alternator and the fuse ? usually, a large 40-60 amp fuse near the battery.Check the ground cable between the engine and the body.Check the serpentine belt and make sure the alternator is spinning with the engine.Check the small power supply wire and the charging light wire. You can measure it with a multimeter, but you might need a wiring diagram and some car electronic skills to do this correctly.You can measure the diode assembly and the voltage regulator to make sure they are not damaged. You can replace these with some alternators, but it is often the same price to buy a new alternator nowadays. It is up to you what you think is more worth it."
Is there a fuse for the alternator?	"In most car models, there is a high-amperage fuse between the alternator?s terminal and the battery. You may also find low amperage fuses for the alternator ignition terminal. It is not very common for these fuses to blow, but it is definitely worth checking."
Can I test my alternator without removing it?	"You most certainly can test your alternator without removing it! A basic voltmeter will do the trick for a basic check. For more advanced tests, it depends on the car model and how accessible the alternator is. In some car models, you cannot reach the alternator well for testing without removing it."
How can I test my alternator without a meter?	"Assuming you don?t have access to a multimeter, there are still a few ways you can test your alternator at home. Start the engine and let it run for a few minutes. Turn on all the lights in your car (headlights, taillights, interior lights, etc.) and observe whether they seem dimmer than usual. If they do, it?s possible that your alternator isn?t charging the battery correctly. If your alternator is not charging the battery at all, your car will eventually die."
How long will a car run with a faulty alternator?	"It depends on how bad the generator is, how many electrical consumers you use, and what car model you drive. If your car battery is fully charged and the alternator is not charging at all, you can expect to drive about 15 miles or 15 minutes until the car stops."
Conclusion	"There are many possible reasons why an alternator won?t charge. However, the most likely cause is a problem with the alternator itself, the drive belt, or the connection between the battery and the alternator. If your alternator is not charging, your car will stall when the battery is drained, so it is important to fix the problem as soon as possible.If your alternator is not charging, there are a few things you can check before taking it in for service. First, make sure all connections are secure, and there is no corrosion between the alternator and battery. Next, check the drive belt to see if it is loose or broken. If everything looks good there and you feel you don?t have enough knowledge to make a proper diagnosis, it?s time to take it in for service."
what are the Causes of Engine Knock ?	"The most common cause of engine knock is either the wrong fuel type in your car or a bad knock sensor. Incorrect ignition timing, lean fuel mixture, or the incorrect type of spark plugs can also cause your engine to detonate.These are the most common reasons why your engine knocks. Here is a little bit more detailed list of the most common causes of a knocking car engine:1. Low Octane RatingRefuel CarThe most common reason why your engine is knocking during acceleration is you have the wrong fuel in your car or just fuel with a low octane rating.Either you filled your gas tank with the wrong gas type the last time you were at the gas station, or the gas station supplied you with bad fuel.If you get fuel with a low octane number in your fuel tank, premature combustion may occur. This will cause the engine to knock.If the issue occurred after you refilled fuel and if you filled the gas tank entirely, you could try using an octane booster to boost up the octane a little bit rather than replacing all fuel in the tank.2. Bad Knock SensorEngine Knock SensorThe next common cause of engine knock is a bad knock sensor. The knock sensor is made for exactly this purpose ? to prevent your engine from knocking.The engine control always wants to have as advanced an ignition as possible for higher performance. If you fill your tank with fuel with a low octane rating, the engine will require a more retarded ignition timing to run without engine knock.Therefore, the knock sensors? job is to monitor for any knocks and, if one occurs, tell the engine to retard the ignition further to prevent engine damage. If this knock sensor has gone bad, it can send false signals to the engine control unit, which will cause a knocking engine.3. Wrong Ignition TimingIgnition TimingToo advanced ignition timing will cause the engine to start knocking or pinging. Because of this, a faulty ignition timing could, of course, cause an engine knock.This only applies if you have an older car with adjustable ignition timing on either the distributor or an adjustable cam or crankshaft position sensor.Unfortunately, newer cars control the ignition timing completely electronically, so you will not find it possible to manually adjust the timing.However, if you have an older car with adjustable ignition timing, you need an ignition timing light to check the timing. Try to retard the timing slightly to see if it helps with the engine detonation. It is recommended to follow the repair manual for the correct ignition timing, though.4. Lean air/fuel mixtureKnocking EngineYou maybe didn?t know it, but the fuel entering the engine is also cooling the combustion chamber. If the air/fuel mixture is too lean, it will not cool down as effectively, and it will cause a lot of unnecessary heat in the combustion chamber.This heat can cause the air-fuel mixture to self-ignite before the spark plug sends its spark, which will cause the engine to start knocking. These types of destinations are hazardous for your engine?s internal parts and can melt down your pistons quickly.5. Wrong spark plugsBest Spark PlugsIt is not very common that wrong spark plugs cause engine knock or detonation, but it could absolutely happen.Spark plugs provide the ignition spark for the ignition of the fuel-air mixture. However, there are many different types of spark plugs, and if you buy the wrong type of spark plug, your engine can start suffering from knocking.In the first instance, the spark is too weak, while in the second instance, the spark plug may not produce a spark at all. Check your repair manual to find the right spark plugs for your car model and ensure that the right model is installed.6. Other Engine Knocking SoundSerpentine Belt ComponentsThere is also a chance that it isn?t engine knock or pinging you hear from your engine; it could be some type of other engine noise.If you hear it knock only when accelerating, it is most likely engine knock or pinging, but if you constantly hear the noise, it may be caused by something else.Some other usual things that can make knocking sounds are the serpentine or timing belt tensioners/pulleys, bad rod bearings, faulty hydraulic lifters, or noisy fuel injectors."
What is Engine Knock?	"Engine knocking or pinging occurs when the air-fuel mixture is getting self-ignited before the spark plug ignites it, because of high heat. It can be caused by a wrong ignition timing, too low fuel octane, or a lean air-fuel mixture.When the engine is on its way up, the air-fuel mixture will self-ignite halfway up, and as you can imagine, this will cause an incredible pressure because the piston has half of the way to reach the top. This can also create incredible heat that can melt holes into your pistons or the cylinder head.This is why it is a good idea to fix your engine knock in time and better not drive around with it."
How to Fix Engine Knock ?	"Now that you know the different things that could cause the engine to knock, you probably also want to know how you can fix it.The first thing you must think of is when the knocking appears. If it happened after you refueled the car, you probably have bad fuel in the fuel tank. To fix this, you need either to replace the fuel or try using an octane booster.You can also check for any trouble codes related to the knock sensor/s with a diagnostic scanner. If you find any trouble codes related to it, it is definitely time to repair the wirings or replace the knock sensor.You also want to check the spark plugs to make sure you use the correct spark plug type for your specific car engine. Use your repair manual to find the right spark plugs.If you have an older car or if the car engine has adjustable ignition timing, you absolutely want to check and adjust it. Check your repair manual to find out if you have an adjustable timing or not.Let a repair shop do it if you are not familiar with adjusting timing, because you also need some special tools for the procedure."
What does Engine Knock Sound like?	"Engine knock sounds like someone is sitting and hitting your engine block with a metal hammer when you are accelerating. If you hear a knocking noise only when accelerating, it is most likely engine knocking or pinging."
How do I stop engine knocking?	The first step to stop engine knocking is to ensure you have fuel with the correct octane rating for your car model. You can try to use an octane booster to make it less sensitive to detonations.
Can I drive a car with a knocking engine?	"It is not recommended to drive a car with a knocking engine. Engine knock or so-called detonation is very dangerous for your engine?s internal parts, which can result in repair costs of over 3000$ if you are not careful."
How much does it cost to fix an engine knock?	"There is no fixed price to fix an engine knock. Often you only have to use octane boosters or refill the fuel tank with new fuel. In the worst case, you have to adjust the ignition timing or replace the knock sensor. You can expect a cost of 100$ to 200$, though."
Can low oil cause engine knock?	"Engine oil is not related to the ignition timing or engine knocking in your car engine. However, it might affect it indirectly if you have such a low engine oil level that your engine is suffering from low oil pressure."
what are the Dirty Engine Air Filter Symptoms ?	"The main symptoms of a dirty or clogged engine air filter include:Power lossStrange engine soundsCheck engine lightReduced Fuel EconomyEngine misfiringBlack Exhaust SmokeGas smellVisible ContaminationHere is a more detailed list of the signs of a dirty or clogged engine air filter to look for:1. Power LossSlow Car AccelerationWhen the filter becomes dirty, it no longer allows enough air to reach the engine. Without the proper balance of air flowing through, the engine can?t run as it is intended. What you are left with is a reduction of power and acceleration.You might notice this more frequently when you demand more of your vehicle, such as during towing or driving up steep inclines. However, any time that the vehicle feels sluggish, it?s wise to visually inspect the air filter. 2. Strange Engine SoundsCheck Noise Under Hood E1609791600132When the engine is running as it should, you should hear a familiar hum coming from the motor. However, when the filter becomes clogged, a lack of airflow can cause some strange sounds.In some cases, you might hear a sputtering noise or a popping sound. It?s also possible to hear a whistling noise due to the obstructed airflow. The more buildup that is on the filter, the louder the noises can become. 3. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightWhen the filter becomes clogged, the flow of air into the engine is restricted. This inadequate supply means too much fuel is being mixed in. With more fuel being burned, the carbon deposits start to build up, causing the Check Engine Light to come on. When these warning lights illuminate, you can use a code scanner to hunt down the root of the issue. 4. Reduced Fuel EconomyBad Fuel ConsumptionTo produce power and momentum, the car engine mixes air with gasoline. However, when the airflow is restricted, too much fuel gets pumped into the engine. When the motor runs rich, you find yourself using more fuel.Any time that the car is using more fuel, it?s a sign that there?s an imbalance with the engine. Pay attention to how often you are filling up, so you can correct issues before they become major. 5. Engine MisfiringCar MisfiresWithout the right amount of air entering the combustion chamber, the motor creates more unburned fuel. This extra soot builds up on the tips of the spark plugs.When the plugs can no longer provide the right level of spark for ignition, the car will misfire and run poorly. You might also notice a rough idle or stalling as a result. 6. Black Exhaust SmokeBlack Smoke From ExhaustIn extreme cases, you are going to see a change in the exhaust smoke leaving the tailpipes. With an incomplete burn of the fuel in the combustion chamber, you will notice black or dark gray smoke coming from the rear of the vehicle.The color is due to the unburned fuel mixing with the hot exhaust. However, it is also a symptom of a malfunctioning fuel injection system or a bad O2 Sensor.7. Gas SmellThat unburned fuel can also create a different smell in some cases. The dirtier the filter becomes, the more you might notice this smell.Additionally, other issues can cause a gasoline smell. For that reason, it?s important to perform a complete diagnosis before determining what?s causing the odor.8. Visible ContaminationIf you can visually look at the air filter, you will notice the signs right away. A clean air filter is going to be either white or pale white. Some reusable filters also have plum-colored media.Once it becomes contaminated, the filter is going to be filled with dirt and debris. It?s going to be naturally dirty and dusty, revealing that it?s time to change it."
where the Air Filter Location ?	"Modern vehicles contain an engine air filter underneath the hood. You can find it in a rectangular-shaped cold air box, often in the front of the engine compartment, where it is easy to access.If you have an older vehicle with a carburetor, the air filter location might be different. These cars use large round metal air cleaners that are nearly impossible to overlook.The engine air filter should never be confused with the cabin air filter. The cabin filter keeps the interior air clean and free of contaminants. It is usually found in the glove box or behind the dashboard. "
what is The Function of an Engine Air Filter ?	"The engine air filter is responsible for keeping contaminants, debris and dirt from getting into the engine through the air. It must remain free of clogs to ensure that the motor gets the right level of air for combustion.The air filter replacement is part of regular car maintenance because it can become clogged over time. When it gets clogged, the air-fuel ratio in the combustion chamber becomes imbalanced, leading to numerous performance issues. "
what is the Air Filter Replacement Cost ?	"The average air filter replacement cost is only $10 to $30 for one made with paper material. In most cars, changing the air filter is a simple process that doesn?t involve any special skills or tools.If you prefer to install a reusable air filter, you can expect to pay between $30 and $100, depending on your vehicle. These reusable filters can be cleaned out for longer use. The engine air filter should often be replaced every 12,000 miles or 12 months, whichever comes first. You can find the recommended replacement schedule in your car owner?s manual. However, if you notice any of the above symptoms, you will want to replace the filter sooner. Considering the low cost, it?s one of the first places to start with any engine performance issues."
Can a dirty air filter ruin your engine?	" Yes, a dirty air filter can destroy your engine in the long run. If your engine can?t breathe properly, it will create unnecessary heat in the engine which will wear engine parts faster. A dirty air filter can also allow dust to enter the engine, which can damage it.     "
How does a dirty air filter affect my car?	"A dirty air filter will affect your car in many ways, and suffering engine performance is the most common way. Lower engine performance can cause many other problems with your car, which is why it?s important to keep your engine air filter clean."
Can I clean my air filter instead of replacing it?  	"No, standard car engine air filters are not washable or reusable. There are aftermarket air filters you can install that are washable, but these cost a bit more in purchase price. However, cleaning an original air filter is never a good idea and will give you a bad result."
Can I drive with a clogged air filter?	"While you could probably drive with a clogged air filter if it?s not completely clogged, it?s always a bad idea. A clogged or dirty air filter will cause a higher load on the engine which can damage it. If you are very unlucky, the engine may even suck in parts of the clogged air filter."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Charcoal Vapor Canister ?	"The most common symptom of a bad charcoal canister is a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also find it difficult to fill up the fuel tank at the gas station without making a mess. You can also hear a hissing noise when opening the fuel tank cap.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing charcoal vapor canister to look for:1. Check Engine Light OnCheck Engine LightThe engine control unit is constantly monitoring all sensors in your car engine, and if one fails, it will store a trouble code and show a check engine light on the dashboard to notify you that something is not as it should be.This is exactly what can happen if the charcoal canister has gone bad. The EVAP system is a closed system that needs to hold a specific pressure. If the engine control unit notices that there is a leak in the system or if it is clogged, the check engine light will show up.To know exactly why the check engine light is showing up, you need to use a diagnostic scanner to check the trouble codes.2. Issues Filling up The Fuel TankRefuel CarThe fuel fumes are going through the charcoal canister, and if the canister is clogged, the fumes will struggle to pass. This will create high pressure in the fuel tank.The same applies when you refuel your car. Fuel goes into the tank, and therefore gases and air needs to go out.If the charcoal canister or fuel vapor vent line is clogged, the air will not be able to flow out when you pour fuel in. This will cause the fuel hose nozzle to shut off, and it can even cause the fuel to pour out everywhere except in the fuel tank.3. Hissing Noise when you open the fuel tank capOpen Fuel Tank CapFor the same reason mentioned before, when the charcoal canister is clogged, it will create a higher overpressure or underpressure in the fuel tank than usual.This is most noticeable when you are about to refuel your car, and you hear a lot of air going out or into the fuel tank when you open the fuel tank cap, which creates a hissing noise.A little bit of under or overpressure in your fuel tank is fine, but if it seems to be a lot more than usual, you do probably have a problem with the EVAP system.4. Fuel Smell OdorBad Car Smell E1609777166642If your charcoal canister has a split in the body, this can cause the canister to lose its stored fuel vapor. Instead of being stored inside the canister before being sent through the vent pipe and the purge valve, a damaged canister body could result in the vapor being released into the atmosphere. This fuel vapor has a strong smell that will be noticeable when the engine is running and also when the engine is switched off. If you?re noticing a strong fuel smell from your vehicle, even when it?s not running, then your charcoal canister is a good place to start in the diagnostic process. 5. Failing Emissions TestCar Emission Test E1609793156790Many countries and states have yearly emission tests that you need to pass for your car to be legal on the streets. During this test, your vehicle?s emission levels are checked to ensure that the fumes that exit the exhaust are meeting regulations. If your fuel canister is faulty, it could be misfueling your engine and therefore cause your vehicle to fail its emissions test as a result. This can be difficult to find, as the fuel canister tends only to work passively. You can try blanking off the fuel canister?s vent pipe and see if doing this affects your vehicle?s emissions. If so, this would indicate a faulty fuel canister that needs to be replaced for your vehicle to fall under emission regulations.6. Excessive Smoke From Exhaust Car Bad SmokeAs with any fault on your vehicle that causes the engine to misfuel, your exhaust will often put out various colors of smoke depending on what the fault is. If your exhaust has started excessively smoking, this could indicate that your engine is being misfueled. This misfueling could be a result of your charcoal canister not operating as it?s designed to. Although it?s uncommon for a charcoal canister to be causing excessive smoke, it would be wrong to say that it never happens! An easy test would be to blank the vent pipe from the charcoal canister and see if the exhaust smoke changes. If so, then this would also point toward a fault with the canister. "
what is The Function of a Charcoal Canister ?	"The charcoal canister or vapor canister works by absorbing the fumes that the fuel in your tank produces as a byproduct. Instead of these fumes being vented out into the atmosphere ? which isn?t very eco-friendly ? they?re absorbed by your charcoal canister. The charcoal in the canister has been engineered to be extra absorbent, making it especially effective at absorbing the vapor given off by your fuel. As this vapor builds up inside the canister over time, it will reach a point where it needs to release some of it. This released vapor gets pushed through the canister?s vent line and purge valve into the engine, where the vapor gets burnt off. "
where the Charcoal Canister Location  ?	"The charcoal canister or vapor canister is usually located under the vehicle, often very close to the fuel tank. It is often hidden under plastic covers, so it can be difficult to locate it. It can sometimes also be located in the engine bay, especially on European cars.Locations for your charcoal canister can vary greatly depending on your vehicle make/model, though.It?s worth noting that I?ve found these canisters in wheel arches on some of the European brands. If you?re struggling to find it, your local dealership should be able to supply you with a component location. "
Charcoal Canister Replacement Cost  ?	"The average charcoal canister replacement cost is between $130 and $300, depending on the car model. A charcoal vapor canister costs $80 to $150. The labor costs $50 to $150.The chances of replacing your fuel canister are very slim, but it does definitely happen if you have a high-mileage car.The charcoal canister itself is often relatively cheap, and you can often find it around 100 bucks.The replacement is often quite easy, and it can often be done within an hour even with only basic knowledge. However, it is located pretty awkwardly on some cars, so you need to check it up before replacing it."
how to make Charcoal Canister Testing and Replacement ?	"The charcoal canister is an important component of a vehicle's evaporative emissions control system. It is designed to capture and store fuel vapors from the fuel tank and prevent them from being released into the atmosphere. Here are the steps to test and replace a charcoal canister:Testing the Charcoal Canister:Locate the charcoal canister: The charcoal canister is usually located in the engine compartment or under the vehicle.Check for damage: Visually inspect the charcoal canister for any signs of damage, such as cracks or broken hoses. If the canister is damaged, it will need to be replaced.Check for leaks: Use a smoke machine or vacuum pump to test the charcoal canister for leaks. If the canister is leaking, it will need to be replaced.Replacing the Charcoal Canister:Disconnect the hoses: Use pliers or a wrench to disconnect the hoses from the charcoal canister. Be sure to label the hoses to ensure proper reinstallation.Remove the canister: Use a socket wrench or screwdriver to remove the mounting bolts or clips that hold the charcoal canister in place.Install the new canister: Install the new charcoal canister by reversing the removal process. Be sure to connect the hoses in the correct locations and tighten the mounting bolts or clips.Test the new canister: After installing the new charcoal canister, test it for leaks using a smoke machine or vacuum pump.It is important to replace the charcoal canister if it is damaged or leaking to ensure proper functioning of the vehicle's evaporative emissions control system.

It is recommended to follow the manufacturer's recommendations for replacement intervals or have a professional mechanic diagnose and replace the canister if necessary."
what are the Oil on Spark Plugs Causes ?	"The most common reason for oil on spark plugs is a leaking valve cover gasket. If you find oil on the spark plug electrode, it may be caused by clogged crankcase ventilation, a faulty turbocharger, bad intake valve seals, or bad piston rings.Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of oil on spark plugs.1. Leaking valve cover gasketEngine Oil On Spark PlugIf your spark plugs look like the picture above, fully covered with oil when you remove them, you should feel lucky.When the oil on your spark plug looks like this, and there is oil on the spark plug threads, it is not coming from the engine?s inside; it is actually coming from the outside from the valve cover, filling up the wells.Around the spark plug holes, there are O-rings, which can be external or integrated with the valve cover gasket. When these get bad because of heat, they will start to leak, and oil will pour into the spark plug holes.This is bad for both the ignition coils and spark plugs as it can cause misfires, and it can also cause these parts to fail.If your whole spark plug is covered in oil, you should definitely replace the valve cover gasket and the O-rings around the spark plugs.2. Clogged Crankcase VentilationOil On Spark Plug TipIf you have oil on the tip of the spark plugs like above, it means that it is coming from the combustion chamber. This is a more worrying problem. Oil in the combustion chamber is never a good sign.The most common cause of oil on the spark plugs is that the crankcase ventilation is clogged or faulty. This creates an overpressure inside the crankcase, which forces oil to be pressed into the combustion chamber from the crankcase ventilation, valve sealings, turbocharger, or piston rings.Check the crankcase ventilation breathing to ensure nothing is clogged, and that the one-way breathing valves work fine if they are equipped on your car model.3. Faulty turbochargerTurbochargerA faulty turbocharger is also pretty common when it comes to oil on spark plugs. When the oil leaks from the turbo inlet compressor sealings, it goes through the combustion chamber and gets stuck on the spark plug.This can also be caused by bad crankcase ventilation, so make sure to check that first.Check your intercooler in your car, and if the intercooler and intake pipes are full of oil, it is probable that your turbocharger has failed.4. Worn out intake valve sealsValve Seal Around Valve ShaftThe valves play a vital role in the combustion chamber by regulating the inflow of air and fuel while controlling the outflow of exhaust gases. Fuel, oil, and coolant should not mix at any time in the engine. If the valve seals wear out, the oil can find its way into the crankcase combustion chamber.The first symptoms of this are your car emitting blue smoke. You should have the valves fixed as soon as possible to prevent further engine trouble. You can learn more about this here: Bad valve seal symptoms.5. Faulty piston ringsPiston Ring FunctionA closer observation of piston rings will reveal compression rings at the top and bottom. As the piston moves up and down along the wall, these rings will collect oil.The rings prevent the oil beneath the pistons from reaching the combustion chambers. However, the rings wear out, and oil finds its way to the spark plugs. This can cause oil from reaching the moving parts.You can learn more about the symptoms here: Bad Piston Rings symptoms.6. Faulty pistonsCar PistonsOil can also leak to the spark plugs through a faulty piston. Pistons operate at high speeds, and they are subject to wear and tear.The fault is likely to be in the piston rings. If there is a crack, melted piston, or other forms of damage, the oil can find its way to the spark plug.The best way to find faulty piston rings is to perform a leak-down test or a compression test. A leak-down test is strongly recommended. You will find the problem very easily with this test."
Is a little oil on the spark plugs bad?	"Whether or not a little oil on the spark plugs is bad depends on where you found the oil. If you find oil in the spark plug wells, it?s likely due to a bad valve cover gasket, which is fairly easy to fix. If you find oil on the spark plug electrodes, it could be internal oil combustion, which could be caused by a much more serious problem."
Can I drive with oil in my spark plugs?	"It is not recommended to drive your car with oil on the spark plugs, whether the oil sits on top of the spark plugs or in the combustion chamber. If the oil is in the wells, it can cause damage to the ignition coil. If you have oil in the combustion chamber, it must be addressed immediately to prevent further damage."
Can a misfire cause oil on spark plugs?	"No. A misfire will not cause oil on your spark plugs. However, a misfire can cause damage to your catalytic converter or other parts, so it is important to fix the misfire as soon as possible."
How do I fix oil on spark plugs?	"If you notice oil in the spark plug wells, you need to replace the valve cover gasket or the O-rings around the wells. If you notice oil on the spark plug electrode, a more serious problem like a bad turbocharger or bad piston rings could be causing it."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Idle Air Control Valve (IAC) ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad idle control valve are rough idle and a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice fluctuating idle speed or a stalling engine on idle when your IAC valve is bad.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing idle air control valve (IAC) to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightThere are tons of sensors throughout your vehicle, so it?s no surprise that one monitors your idle control valve. As soon as something doesn?t come back right, it sends a signal to the ECM to let you know that there is a problem.The most common code is a P0505, which is an Idle Control System Malfunction. But while this is the most common check engine code, it?s not the only one that might point you towards a faulty idle control valve.2. Fluctuating Idle SpeedLow Idle RpmYour vehicle?s idle control valve is supposed to keep everything smooth when idling, so it makes sense that if it?s acting up, your idle speed is going to fluctuate. While it depends on what?s wrong with the valve, a fluctuating idle speed is one of the most common symptoms.Keep in mind that your idle speed will fluctuate even more when you turn on or turn off accessories, as your ECM won?t adjust to the changing load without an idle control valve.3. Rough Engine IdleHigh Idle RpmYour idle control valve is supposed to keep everything consistent while you?re idling. But if the valve is stuck open, closed, or somewhere in between, a rough idle can result. You might be able to ?fix? this problem by idling at different altitudes or by turning off engine loads. But in reality, you?re not fixing the problem ? you?re only hiding it.Keep in mind that a rough engine idle related to a faulty idle control valve will be because of air or too much air, and it shouldn?t consist of engine misfires or other more serious conditions. If this is happening, it?s indicative of a deeper problem that you?ll need to troubleshoot, even if you need to replace your idle control valve.4. Engine StallingEngine StallIf your vehicle?s idle control valve is damaged enough, it won?t adjust at all to various conditions. So, while you might not have problems in some conditions, others might make it stall out completely.Anything from a change in elevation to turning on the air conditioning can cause your engine to stall, since it doesn?t have the capability to adjust to different conditions. While this is rare unless your vehicle has a completely shot idle control valve, it?s not unheard of either."
what are The Function of an Idle Control Valve ?	"Your vehicle?s idle control valve takes all the variances into account and adjusts your engine?s idle speed to keep everything running smoothly. It might not be the sexiest component out there, but without it, your engine can stall out and you can run into various performance issues.While you?ve come to expect your engine to maintain a consistent RPM no matter what you?re doing, your engine wouldn?t be able to do this effectively without an idle control valve.That?s because there are a multitude of conditions that affect your engine?s idle speed. Everything from your current altitude to the number of accessories that your engine is running can impact your idle speed."
where is the Idle Control Valve Location ?	"Your vehicle?s idle control valve is mostly integrated into the throttle body on modern engines. On older engines, it was an external unit installed somewhere around the air intake. From there, it can easily control the airflow to your engine to keep a consistent idle, regardless of engine and environmental conditions.The good news is that this is typically near the top of your engine, so if you?re looking to replace it yourself, it?s usually pretty easy to reach. There are few components that easier to access than your idle control valve."
Idle Control Valve Testing and Cleaning ?	"The idle control valve (ICV) is a component in a car's engine management system that regulates the amount of air flowing into the engine while idling. Over time, the ICV can become dirty or malfunction, which can result in rough idling or stalling. Here are the steps to test and clean an idle control valve:Tools required:ScrewdriverMultimeterCleaning solution (such as carburetor cleaner)Testing the ICV:Disconnect the negative battery cable to prevent any electrical shock.Locate the idle control valve on the engine. It is usually attached to the throttle body or intake manifold.Remove the electrical connector from the valve.Use a multimeter to check the resistance of the valve. The resistance should be within the range specified in the vehicle's service manual.If the resistance is not within the specified range, replace the valve.Cleaning the ICV:Remove the idle control valve from the engine. Depending on the make and model of the vehicle, this may require removing the throttle body or other components.Place the valve in a container with cleaning solution, such as carburetor cleaner. Make sure that the valve is completely submerged in the solution.Use a soft-bristled brush to scrub the valve and remove any dirt or debris.Rinse the valve with clean water and let it air dry completely.Reinstall the valve onto the engine and reconnect the electrical connector.Reconnect the negative battery cable.Note: Before cleaning the ICV, it is important to check the service manual for any specific cleaning procedures or cautions. Some idle control valves may not be designed to be cleaned, and attempting to clean them can cause damage."
what is the Idle Control Valve Replacement Cost ?	"The average idle control valve replacement cost is between $100 and $500. Keep in mind that these costs can vary depending on what you drive and where you take it for repairs. While this might seem like a huge cost variance, this almost all comes from the variance in part prices.You can find an aftermarket idle control valve for between $50 and $400, and you might need to spend even more if you want an OEM replacement part. Meanwhile, the labor costs are usually pretty cheap, only costing between $50 and $100.However, this means that if you are looking to try and save a little money by doing the job yourself, you?re not going to save all that much compared to the overall repair costs. But the good news is that there are a few parts that are easier to replace.Usually, all you need to do is unplug and remove a single bolt from the old sensor and gently pry it off. From there, all you need to do is bolt on the new sensor and plug it in. Finally, make sure you disconnect the battery before removing the old sensor.Not only will this keep you from accidentally shorting anything in the system, but you?ll also reset the check engine light in the process.If the idle control valve is integrated into the throttle body, you may have to replace the whole throttle body though, which is a more costly story."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Boost Pressure Sensor  ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad or failing boost pressure sensor are reduced or increased engine performance and a check engine light on your dashboard. If your car is equipped with a boost pressure gauge, you can also see if the boost pressure has increased or decreased.If you are interested in a closer look at these signs, here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing boost pressure sensor to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightIf you have a faulty boost pressure sensor, you?re going to have a check engine light. More specifically, you?re going to have a code P0236. If you have this engine code, there?s a good chance that you have a faulty boost pressure sensor, but it?s not the only thing that could be causing it.You?ll still need to rule out an underlying electrical issue, and you?ll need to verify that there?s nothing wrong with your turbo or supercharger. If there is an underlying issue, your boost pressure sensor is doing precisely what it?s supposed to ? alerting you of an underlying problem.2. Reduced or Increased Engine PerformanceSlow Acceleration CarYour boost pressure sensor tells your ECM the actual output of your turbo or supercharger, so if it?s not reporting accurate numbers, the ECM will adjust to faulty readings. This will cause an overall decrease or increase in engine performance.A faulty boost pressure sensor will cause more noticeable drops in performance in a turbocharged engine than in a supercharged one, but drops in engine performance can happen in both. That?s because even with a supercharged engine, the ECM doesn?t know how the supercharger is performing, so it can?t optimize performance.However, with a turbocharged engine, it might cut the turbo off completely, which will cause a significant drop in engine performance.In some rare cases, it can also increase the turbo pressure, which can cause the performance to increase. This can be fatal for your engine, so you do absolutely want to address this issue as fast as possible.3. Decrease or Increase in Boost PressureBoost PressureAs we discussed in the previous symptoms section, a faulty boost pressure sensor can cause the engine performance to increase or decrease. This is caused by an increased or decreased turbo pressure.Some car models do actually have a turbo pressure gauge which you can read to find the current turbo pressure. If you see that the pressure is lower or higher than usual on higher loads, it can absolutely be caused by a bad boost pressure sensor."
What is a Boost Pressure Sensor?	"Your vehicle?s boost pressure sensor tells the ECM how much boost the turbocharger or supercharger is actually producing. While the ECM requests a specific amount of boost, it needs to measure the result of its request.That?s where the boost pressure sensor comes in. This lets the ECM know what?s actually happening to optimize the fuel-to-air ratio for optimal performance. Moreover, it acts as a way to protect the rest of the engine if the supercharger or turbocharger stops functioning the way it?s supposed to."
where the Boost Pressure Sensor Location ?	"Your vehicle?s boost pressure sensor is usually located on the boost pipes between the intake manifold and the turbocharger. It can also be located on the intake manifold on some car models.This area allows it to record the boost that the supercharger or turbocharger is creating without getting in the way of anything.While this is a fairly straightforward location near the top of the engine, you might need to remove a few components to gain access to it. However, when it comes to finding and accessing the boost pressure sensor, it?s one of the easier components on most vehicles."
what is the Boost Pressure Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"The average boost pressure sensor replacement cost is between $175 and $200. However, this cost can vary depending on the vehicle you drive and where you take it for repairs. If you?re looking to replace this sensor yourself to save a little money, you can, but most of the cost is in parts, not labor.The average boost pressure sensor costs over $125. But while you?re not going to save a ton of money, replacing the boost pressure sensor yourself is typically fairly straightforward. All you need to do is disconnect the battery, then unplug the electrical connector and remove the bolt holding the sensor on.From there, bolt the new sensor in, plug it in, and reconnect the battery! If the boost pressure sensor was the problem, you should be good to go now."
Can I Drive With a Faulty Boost Pressure Sensor?	"You should never drive with a faulty boost pressure sensor. Without a boost pressure sensor, it?s quite common for the ECM to direct too much power to the turbocharger, which can have catastrophic consequences for your engine.By ignoring a sensor that would cost you under $200 to replace, you can quickly cause several thousand dollars in damages, and you might end up totaling your entire engine. That?s because too much boost can cause your engine to overheat, which can damage various components.If you don?t have the money to replace your boost pressure sensor right away, it?s better to leave the vehicle in the garage until you can repair it. It might be a major inconvenience, but it?s not worth the risk."
how tomake Boost Pressure Sensor Testing ?	"The boost pressure sensor is a component in a car's engine management system that measures the pressure of the air entering the engine. If the sensor is malfunctioning or damaged, it can cause a loss of power or other engine performance issues. Here are the steps to test a boost pressure sensor:Tools required:MultimeterVacuum pumpService manual (for the specific make and model of the vehicle)Testing the boost pressure sensor:Locate the boost pressure sensor on the engine. It is usually located on the intake manifold or near the turbocharger.Disconnect the electrical connector from the sensor.Use a multimeter to check the resistance of the sensor. The resistance should be within the range specified in the vehicle's service manual.If the resistance is not within the specified range, replace the sensor.Use a vacuum pump to apply vacuum to the sensor. The voltage output of the sensor should increase as the vacuum pressure increases. Consult the service manual for the specific voltage range.If the voltage output is not within the specified range, replace the sensor.Note: Before testing the boost pressure sensor, it is important to check the service manual for any specific testing procedures or cautions. Some sensors may require special equipment or testing procedures. It is also important to wear appropriate safety gear, such as eye protection, when working with engine components."
Conclusion	"If you suspect your boost pressure sensor is bad or malfunctioning, be sure to have it checked by a professional mechanic as soon as possible. Due to the importance of proper boost pressure in an engine, ignoring the problem will only make it worse and can eventually lead to serious engine damage.Always start the diagnosis by reading the fault code memory from the engine control module with an OBD scanner. This will give you very valuable information that can save you a lot of money."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Alternator ?	"The most common symptom of a bad alternator is a battery warning light on your dashboard. You may also notice flickering headlights or starting issues. If you hear a noise from the engine, it can definitely come from a bad alternatorWhile you now know the most common signs, let?s take a look a little bit more in-depth into the symptoms. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing alternator to look for:1. Battery Warning LightBattery Light OnIf you have checked all your warning lights on your dashboard while the ignition is on, but the car engine is not running, you have probably noticed a warning light with a car battery.This battery light will light up with two conditions ? If the ignition is on and if the battery power is over 13 volts. Usually, your car battery has 12 volts, and when the alternator is charging, you will have around 14.2 volts in your system.If the voltage in the system drops below 13 volts while the ignition is on ? the battery light will light up on your dashboard, meaning that your alternator is not charging properly.2. Headlights are dim or flickeringDim Headlights CarThe headlights are one of these very high power consumers in your car that requires a lot of electricity. The more power the headlights will have, the brighter they will light up.If your alternator is bad, the voltage will drop, and they will dim. If you have noticed that the headlight seems to be worse than before, your alternator might be a problem.You might also notice flickering headlights caused by an unstable voltage from the alternator.Newer cars often have LED headlights, and in these cars, you will not experience a dim effect of a bad alternator, but they might shut off completely instead.3. Car Starting ProblemStarting CarEvery time you drive your car, the alternator should recharge your car battery fully, so the next time you are parking and starting your car, it should have full power.However, if the alternator is going bad, it might not charge it fully every time you drive.If it is charging it a little bit under a fully charged car battery every time you are driving ? you will finally come to a point when the car drained more power than it charged. This is when your car will not start in the morning anymore.If you notice that your car feels tired every time you start it, it might be a problem with your alternator.4. Noise from engine bayAlternator CarYour alternator contains bearings and other spinning electronic components. If your alternator got physical damage, you might hear loud squealing or banging noises from it.The most common problem is a bad bearing inside the generator, which will cause a scratching noise from it. Usually, alternators are pretty easy to see from the engine bay, so it is also easy to open and listen if you can locate the alternator?s noise.However, in some car models, the alternator might be located far down in the engine bay and difficult to listen for noises. In this case, you should maybe contact a professional mechanic.5. Battery DrainCar Battery ChargerIf you are charging the car battery often, but the battery of your car is continually drained, even if it is in good condition, this also means that your car?s alternator has probably.There can be a lot of reasons why the alternator will not charge the car battery properly. You can find more information about it in our other article: Alternator not charging causes.6. Other Electric FailuresCar ElectronicsWhen an electric component lacks voltage, there could be many strange issues, and as you already know, modern cars have thousands of them.So, of course, low voltage caused by a bad alternator may cause a lot of strange symptoms both inside and outside of your car. If you think your car is haunted, it is definitely time to check the alternator."
where the Alternator Location ?	"The alternator is located at the front of the engine, near the serpentine belt. It is usually located at a high point of the engine, but it can also be located far down.The serpentine belt powers the alternator, and the serpentine belt are powered by the crankshaft pulley, which is always located at the front of the engine."
how to test the the alternator ?	"The alternator is a component in a car's charging system that produces electrical power to recharge the battery and power the electrical system while the engine is running. If the alternator is malfunctioning, it can cause a range of issues, such as a dead battery or dimming headlights. Here are the steps to test an alternator:Tools required:MultimeterService manual (for the specific make and model of the vehicle)Testing the alternator:Start the engine and let it idle.Turn on the headlights and other electrical accessories to put a load on the charging system.Use a multimeter to check the voltage at the battery terminals. The voltage should be between 13.5 and 14.5 volts.If the voltage is below 13.5 volts, the alternator is not charging the battery properly and may need to be replaced.Use the multimeter to check the alternator output. Connect the multimeter to the battery terminals and measure the voltage while the engine is running. The voltage should be within the range specified in the service manual.If the voltage is not within the specified range, check the alternator wiring and connections to make sure they are secure and free of corrosion. If the wiring and connections are good, the alternator may need to be replaced.Note: It is important to consult the service manual for the specific testing procedures and voltage ranges for the alternator in the make and model of the vehicle being tested. Additionally, when working with electrical components, it is important to wear appropriate safety gear, such as eye protection, and disconnect the battery to prevent electrical shock."
what is the Alternator Replacement Cost?	"The average alternator replacement cost is between $200 and $800, depending on the car model and labor costs. An alternator costs $150 to $400 and labor costs $50 to $400.Depending on the number of poles, the rotors, the output power, the operating phenomenon, the speed (revolutions per minute), the type of coil, and the type of assembly, different generators are available on the market.Repairing an alternator is generally not preferred (because of the high repair costs), so a new alternator should preferably be installed. A new alternator can cost you $150-$400 plus labor costs."
what is the Power Steering Fluid Types ?	"The most common power steering fluid types are the ATF transmission fluid, synthetic-based and universal power steering fluid. All of these power steering fluid types have their own properties, and it?s important to choose the right type for your car.Here is a more detailed list of the different power steering fluid types:1. ATF Transmission FluidPower Steering FluidSome vehicles are compatible with automatic transmission fluid. In these vehicles, you can use Dexron, Mercon, ATF+4, Type F and other varieties of transmission fluid for your power steering.Most domestic vehicles from the 1970s until the mid-1990s used automatic transmission fluid. These include Ford, GM and Chrysler vehicles. Additionally, any United States-built Volkswagen models from 1984 until 1989 also use automatic transmission fluid. 2. Synthetic-Based Hydraulic FluidJapanese and European vehicles maintain a different standards with the power steering fluid, requiring a high-performance synthetic-based fluid to meet ISO 7308 and DIN 51 524T3 standards. Volkswagen, Volvo, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi all hold to a different standard, based on the year, make, and model of the vehicle.Additionally, Subaru, Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi and Honda have unique power steering fluid specifications. The synthetic fluid is built to flow well, even at lower temperatures, thereby improving pump lubrication and extending the system?s life. 3. Universal Power Steering FluidThere is also a universal power steering fluid option that can be used in many modern vehicles. However, a few manufacturers recommend putting special additives in this fluid to add pump and seal lubricity or to provide corrosion protection.To find the appropriate power steering fluid for a vehicle, you want to look at the power steering reservoir cap. The information should also be listed in the car owner?s manual. "
why Should I Change Power Steering Fluid?	"Because power steering fluid is used in a clean environment, it will last longer than many other automotive fluids. In fact, the majority of manufacturers don?t list a recommended service interval for their power steering fluid. With that said, it?s a general rule of thumb to replace the power steering fluid every 50,000 miles or 5 years, whichever comes first.After this long, the fluid begins to break down and you might notice contamination, which could affect the steering gear and pump. Additionally, the corrosion inhibitors become depleted. Combined with the high temperatures underneath the hood, it?s possible for the fluid to start oxidizing.You can check your owner?s manual to see if the automaker specifies a changing interval or follow the recommended guidelines listed above. However, if the fluid appears dirty or dark, you should change it no matter how long it has been.Just like any other automotive fluid, the power steering fluid is meant for lubrication. If it begins to take on debris and moisture, it won?t be as effective. Old power steering fluid can cause the pump to make noise and fail. "
How to Check Power Steering Fluid Level ?	"1. Locate the Reservoir & PumpBefore you can check the power steering fluid, you must know where to look. The power steering pump typically sits on one side of the engine, and is driven by a belt. On the other hand, the reservoir is found on the top of this pump. In a few vehicles, the reservoir is remote and mounted on the inner fender, because there isn?t room on the pump for it. Make sure your vehicle is OFF before you proceed any further. 2. Remove the CapBefore you take off the cap, it?s important to wipe away any debris or dirt from the area. You don?t want any contaminants getting into the fluid when the cap is off.Carefully unscrew the cap to the reservoir. With the dipstick attached, or by using markings on the reservoir, check the fluid level. It might indicate FULL or have an ADD/LOW line.For the most part, your vehicle should contain the same amount of fluid over the years. However, as your vehicle gets older, or if there is a small leak somewhere, you might notice lower fluid levels. 3. Add More FluidIf the power steering fluid level is low, you want to add enough until it reaches the FULL marking. This fluid will expand as it gets hot, so you may have different markings based on if the system is HOT or COLD.Do not overfill the fluid reservoir. Otherwise, the power steering fluid could start to leak from the system, especially as it gets hot and runs out of room in the reservoir. "
How to Change Power Steering Fluid ?	"1. Drain the SystemYou must disconnect all of the hoses from the steering rack or gear and drain the fluid into a container. However, this could still leave some trapped fluid.To get this fluid out, you would reconnect the system ? except for the return hose ? and add a small amount of fresh power steering fluid. Once you turn on the vehicle, the pump will push out the old fluid through this hose. Make sure you catch it in a container.Additionally, you will want to cycle the steering wheel around with the pump turning to ensure the fresh fluid has taken over the old fluid. 2. Add Fresh Power Steering FluidReconnect the return hose. With the old fluid removed, you are ready to add fresh power steering fluid to the system. Make sure you only use compatible fluid in your system.3. Bleed the power steering systemAdd fluid until it reaches the FULL mark. Start the car engine and turn the steering wheel fully to both left and right several times. Fill more fluid if the level drops."
what is the Cost to Replace Power Steering Fluid ?	"The power steering fluid replacement cost averages between $95 and $140 when you take your vehicle to the shop. However, you can do it yourself for just the cost of the new fluid.However, if you don?t change the power steering fluid, you could end up with a damaged pump. To replace the power steering pump, you might spend several hundred dollars. "
Can I just refill my power steering fluid?	"Yes. If the power steering system is not completely empty, you can just refill the power steering fluid reservoir. However, if there are any leaks, you should repair it first. You do also want to use the right type of power steering fluid."
How do I know if you need power steering fluid?	"The easiest way to know if your car needs power steering fluid is to check the level in the reservoir. There is usually a min and max mark on the reservoir, and if the level is below the low mark, you need to fill it. Also, if you hear bad noises coming from the power steering pump when you turn the steering wheel, this is also a sign that the level is low."
What happens if you have low power steering fluid?	"If you have low power steering fluid, air will enter the hydraulic system, and this will cause jerky or rough steering. It can even cause damage to the power steering system. The most common part that can get damaged due to low power steering fluid is the power steering pump."
How do I know which power steering fluid to use?	"The best way to determine which power steering fluid you should use for your car is to check your owner?s manual. You can also use auto part stores online and enter your license plate number, and they will tell you what power steering fluid to use."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Camshaft Position Sensor ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad camshaft position sensor are a hard-to-start engine or a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice issues like poor engine performance or a misfiring engine.While these are not all the signs, they are definitely the most common ones. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing camshaft position sensor to look for:1. Engine Won?t StartHard StartingThe most common sign of all bad camshaft position sensor symptoms is that the car will be more difficult to start, or it won?t start at all. As the camshaft sensor becomes weaker, it does not send the signal to the on-board computer, and as a result, the ignition system cannot produce a spark correctly.No spark means that the engine will not start at all, indicating that the camshaft sensor has failed. Newer cars will detect that the camshaft position sensor is not functioning properly, and they will then use the crankshaft position sensor instead.2. Check Engine Light Comes OnCheck Engine LightThe check engine light illuminates for many reasons, including when the camshaft position sensor fails. In a lot of cases, the only symptom you will have from a bad camshaft position sensor is a check engine light on your dashboard.If the check engine light on your car lights up, it is recommended that you visit a car specialist and have your car scanned to check the trouble codes. You can also do this with an OBD scanner at home. People usually ignore the ?check engine? light without knowing that this could be a sign of something serious, including engine damage.3. Poor Engine PerformanceSlow Acceleration Car E1609777175866One of the most common problems that occur due to a poor camshaft position sensor is that the engine?s power drops dramatically. You will notice frequent stalling, idling, and a drop in engine speed. Fuel efficiency also decreases.All of these problems should be addressed immediately, and they usually occur because of a damaged camshaft position sensor. This is most often because the engine can go into Limp mode when you have a broken camshaft position sensor.4. Engine misfire & vibrationCar Misfires E1609774947173In addition to engine vibrations and stalling, a poor camshaft sensor also leads to engine misfires, which may cause vibrations while accelerating. If you feel that your car engine?s performance is reduced and you have a check engine light on the dashboard, it?s definitely time to check your car?s trouble codes.5. Problems with Shifting GearsCar Shifting Problems E1609782519191Some cars with an automatic transmission won?t change gears properly if you have a bad camshaft position sensor. This may be because the engine will be in limp mode due to the trouble code from the camshaft position sensor.6. Bad Fuel consumptionHigh Fuel Consumtion E1609782695545Reduced power due to the camshaft position sensor can also cause a higher fuel consumption. This is pretty rare when it comes to a faulty camshaft position sensor, but it is not impossible. If you experience a high fuel consumption, you should absolutely check the trouble codes for any codes related to the camshaft position sensor."
What is a Camshaft Position Sensor?	"The camshaft sensor?s core functionality is to work in combination with the crankshaft sensor of your vehicle. Its purpose is to determine the position of the camshaft drive very precisely. As a result, it generates signals in the same way as the crankshaft position sensor. It helps the engine determine the exact time the first cylinder is in the top dead center position.The engine system uses the information generated by the camshaft for various purposes. Essentially, the information helps to start the injection process during the sequential injection. It also supports the actuation signal for the pump nozzle injection system and calibrates the knock control.The Hall principle is the core working concept of a camshaft sensor. A ring gear on the camshaft is scanned, and the rotation of the ring gear causes a change in the voltage of the Hall IC located in the sensor head. This induces a change in the voltage transmission of the control unit.The information resulting from the change is read electronically and evaluated by the computerized system to record it. In other words, a bad camshaft can also interfere with the functionality of the crankshaft position sensor, and ultimately, it will cause various problems for the overall experience you have with your vehicle in terms of engine performance."
where is the Camshaft position sensor location ?	"The camshaft position sensor is always located near the camshaft, often at the top of the valve cover, but it can also be installed from the side of the cylinder head.Check around the head or valve cover and follow any electrical wires and you will for sure find the camshaft position sensor."
how to make Camshaft Position Sensor Testing ?	"The camshaft position sensor is a component in a car's engine management system that measures the position and speed of the camshaft. If the sensor is malfunctioning or damaged, it can cause a range of engine performance issues, such as misfires or hard starting. Here are the steps to test a camshaft position sensor:Tools required:MultimeterService manual (for the specific make and model of the vehicle)Testing the camshaft position sensor:Locate the camshaft position sensor on the engine. It is usually located near the camshaft or on the timing cover.Disconnect the electrical connector from the sensor.Use a multimeter to check the resistance of the sensor. The resistance should be within the range specified in the vehicle's service manual.If the resistance is not within the specified range, replace the sensor.Use the multimeter to check the voltage output of the sensor. Connect the positive lead of the multimeter to the signal wire of the sensor and the negative lead to a ground. Turn the ignition key to the ""on"" position without starting the engine, and observe the voltage output while cranking the engine. The voltage output should fluctuate as the engine cranks.If the voltage output is not within the specified range or does not fluctuate, replace the sensor.If the voltage output is within the specified range and fluctuates, check the wiring and connections between the sensor and the engine control module (ECM). Make sure that the wiring is secure and free of corrosion.Note: Before testing the camshaft position sensor, it is important to check the service manual for any specific testing procedures or cautions. Some sensors may require special equipment or testing procedures. It is also important to wear appropriate safety gear, such as eye protection, when working with engine components."
what is the Camshaft Position sensor replacement cost?	"The average camshaft position sensor replacement cost is between $100 and $250. The part itself costs between $75 and $120, while labor costs range from $30 to $130.A little market research will help you get the best price for the part and the associated labor costs.On average, this part is not very expensive, and the cost of replacing a camshaft position sensor is between $75 and $120 for most vehicles. These prices can vary depending on which supplier you buy it from, where you live, and which company makes it. The cost of replacement in a luxury car can be much higher. If you don?t replace the camshaft position sensor yourself, the labor cost of replacement would be an additional $30 to $130, depending on which car dealer you get it repaired by. If you were to replace it yourself, the cost of replacement would be nearly halved. It can be easily replaced using the tools you most likely already have."
Can I drive with a bad camshaft position sensor?	"It?s not recommended to drive with a bad camshaft position sensor, even if you most likely can. If your camshaft position sensor is bad, it will likely cause your car to run poorly and may even cause it to not start. However, it will most likely not cause your car to shut off. Even so, I wouldn?t recommend driving with a bad camshaft position sensor. It?s best to have the sensor replaced as soon as possible."
Is it hard to replace a camshaft position sensor?	"In most car models, replacing the camshaft position sensor is fairly easy, but it depends on the make and model of your car. If you are not comfortable doing the repair yourself, it is best to take your car to a mechanic."
How long does a camshaft sensor last?	"The camshaft position sensor is built to last the life of the car, and there is no set maintenance schedule for when the camshaft position sensor should be replaced. It only needs to be replaced when it is damaged or bad."
Will a bad camshaft sensor throw a code?	"Yes. A bad camshaft position sensor will in most cases throw a code, and it may also cause your check engine light to come on. However, that doesn?t necessarily mean that the sensor itself is bad. There could be an issue with the wiring between the sensor and the ECM, or there could be a problem with the way the ECM interprets signals from the sensor."
How to Remove a Stripped Oil Drain Plug ?	"To remove a stripped oil drain plug, with a new drain plug ready to go, use your vice grip pliers to get around the oil drain plug. Turn the pliers counterclockwise and use a hammer if you need more force. Once it becomes loose enough, you should be able to unscrew it.Here are some more detailed steps on how to remove a stripped oil drain plug:1. Get a New Drain PlugBefore you get started, it?s always best to ensure you have the necessary equipment to complete the jobs. One item that you should have on hand is the new drain plug.When you take the stripped plug out, you will want to put the new one right in its place. Otherwise, you will have to leave the hole open while you go get the plug. 2. Use Vice Grip PliersVice Grip PlierYou can use a set of vice grip pliers to grab onto the rounded-off drain plug. We recommend using the round-jaw variety.If you opt for the flat-jaw type, you might have trouble locking around the bolt. Without locking onto it, you won?t be able to remove it.Once you have a tight grip on the drain plug, turn the pliers counterclockwise. You may be able to loosen the plug slightly. If you can?t get it moving at all, hit the vice grips gently with a hammer. With a little patience, you will get it turning. If the plug is cross-threaded or the oil pan threads are also damaged, you might need to put forth even more effort. The vice grips could cause more issues by stripping the head further. In this case, it might be better to use a socket instead. 3. Unscrew ItYou don?t want to attempt removing the plug until it has been loosened. Some people use a flathead screwdriver to pry it out, but this is not a good idea.The screwdriver can easily damage your oil pan, which cannot be repaired. You will be looking at a much more expensive repair if you harm the oil pan. "
How to Repair the Oil Pan Hole ?	"1. Get a Drain Plug Repair KitIf you are trying to repair the hole in your oil pan, you want to get a complete kit to finish the job. These drain plug repair kits come with a reaming bit to get out any of the old thread.The kit will also include tools of varying sizes. You will be able to use this kit in the future for other projects, from the automotive gearbox to your household sump pump.You can use something like Highking Tool Oil Pan Thread Repair Kit. This is an affiliate link and this means that at no cost to you, we may receive a small commission for qualifying purchases.2. Eliminate Damaged ThreadsThe reaming bit must be used on the damaged threads. Continue to work away on them until all of the damage is removed. By using this kit, you can give the surface a renewed finish. Once that?s done, it will hold a new plug without any issues unless you strip it again. 3. Tap Out New ThreadsYou will need to choose the appropriately-sized tap to thread the hole. Your kit should come with several to pick from. Using this tool helps you to cut new threads in the hole.These new threads will be used to hold onto the drain plug. Make sure you rotate the tap several times, moving clockwise. When you are done going that way, take it back one to two times counterclockwise.You want to repeat this process several times. It is done when the tap gets through the entire depth of the hole in the oil drain pan. Once the threads are completed, it?s best to take a look at the work. You want all of the threads to appear even and there shouldn?t be an excessive amount of metal shavings left behind. 4. Flush Oil PanTo ensure there aren?t metal shavings, it?s a good practice to flush the system before adding the fresh oil. When you are done tapping, flush the system with «- to 1-quart of motor oil. When you drain this oil out, the metal shavings should come with it. If you don?t do this step, you risk having metal pieces flowing through the oil and motor, thereby leading to permanent damage. 5. Install New PlugIt?s time to put that new drain plug in the hole. Thread the plug into the fixed drain hole. At first, you should be very careful. If anything feels awkward, it?s best to take another look at it before you shove the drain plug inside.Torque the new drain plug to factory specifications. When you are finished, inspect the sealing washer to ensure it is evenly placed around the hole?s perimeter for a good fit. 6. Refill System & CheckYou want to check any work that you perform on your vehicle and this job is no different. It?s important that you inspect your repair for any sign of leaks. Fill the engine with new oil, using the proper amount as outlined by the manufacturer. If there are no leaks at first, start the engine.With the motor running, you want to perform another inspection. If you don?t see anything, take the vehicle around the block. After this test drive, everything should remain completely dry if you performed the fix correctly. If there are leaks, don?t drive the car. You need to start back over and figure out what went wrong. The job isn?t complete until no more oil is seeping through."
How Does an Oil Drain Plug Get Stripped ?	"The word stripped can define two different conditions with the oil drain plug and hole. While they occur in different locations, the concept remains the same.If damage to the threads of the drain plug occurs, it is labeled stripped. Because it becomes impossible to tighten this oil drain plug into the hole, it can be challenging to perform an oil change.The term can also describe the stripping of the oil pan drain hole threads. When this happens, the drain plug cannot be torqued appropriately after an oil change. With the plug not properly torqued, the oil will leak through the plug. Failure to fix this problem could lead to engine damage as the oil level continues to drop. Stripped plugs and threads often occur because of over-tightening. Every drain plug must be tightened to a specific torque, according to the manufacturer?s specs. Drain plug head damage can also be caused by using the wrong size socket or wrench on it. This problem is often seen when a metric is used instead of standard and vice versa. "
what are the Things to consider before starting ?	"There are some things that you have to consider before trying to clean your catalytic converter. In a lot of cases, the parts inside the catalytic converter will become loose. If this is the case, you can?t repair your catalytic converter without removing and replacing it.1. Too cloggedIf your catalytic converter is so clogged that the engine will not run, you have to remove the catalytic converter and either use special tools or replace the whole catalytic converter.2. Check/listen for loose partsYou can take a rubber hammer and hit your catalytic converter carefully and listen to ascertain if there seem to be any loose parts inside it. If you can hear loose parts, I recommend removing and inspecting the catalytic converter because the loose parts could come even looser and completely clog your exhaust pipe, which may cause your vehicle to stop while driving.Clogged Catalytic ConverterA clogged piece from the catalytic converter. If you find a piece like this in the exhaust system, it?s time to replace the catalytic converter.3. Purified catalystRemember that your catalytic converter may have been cleaned inside, and the parts inside it may have blown out from the exhaust pipe. This can be tough to see without removing it. If you suspect this is the case, you should remove the catalytic converter and check it.4. Oil consumptionYour catalytic converter may have gotten clogged due to excessive internal oil consumption, caused by oil entering the cylinders and getting combusted and burned inside the hot catalytic converter.If this is the case, you should always repair the internal oil leak before proceeding, as it may only work for a short time until the catalytic converter is clogged again. Common symptoms of an internal oil leak are clogged crankcase ventilation, broken valve seals, or piston rings. Always check the crankcase ventilation first."

What Does A Head Gasket Do?	"Your head gasket sits between the head of your engine and the combustion chamber, and it keeps all the various fluids in the correct channels. This might seem like a pretty simple job, but it?s so close to the combustion chamber that it gets exposed to a lot of force and movement.Moreover, if the seals start to give out, you?re going to run into a litany of problems that can lead to further engine damage. It might seem like a simple component, but it has a critical job."
How To Test Your Head Gasket	"The two most straightforward ways to test your head gasket are to check your oil, and check your exhaust. But while those might be the easiest ways, they aren?t the only things you can check for confirmation. Below, I?ll highlight the seven most effective ways to test if you have a blown head gasket:1. Check Your Engine OilCheck Engine Oil LevelOne of the easiest and most effective ways to test if you have a blown head gasket is to take a look at your engine oil. You can check it by pulling the dipstick, but if you?re close to needing an oil change, it?s far more effective to drain it from the pan and look.Engine oil mixed with coolant is indicative of a blown head gasket. You?ll know that it?s mixed if you see a milky color in your oil instead of a brownish/black color of used oil. The more coolant that?s there, the milkier the color will be.2. Check Your ExhaustWhite Smoke From ExhaustIf you look at your exhaust and there?s far more smoke than usual, that might mean you have a blown head gasket. However, there are a few things you need to be aware of when diagnosing excess exhaust.First, as the temperature drops outside, you can expect more exhaust than during warmer weather. This is entirely normal and doesn?t indicate a blown head gasket.Second, you should be looking for excessive white smoke if you have a blown head gasket, as this is the color that coolant burns if it gets into the combustion chamber. Finally, you need to always have excessive smoke for the problem to be a blown head gasket.If the amount of exhaust smoke fluctuates after warming up or on different days, the problem likely isn?t a blown head gasket.3. Check Your Spark PlugsOil Spark PlugA telltale sign of a blown head gasket is oil or coolant on your spark plugs. While this isn?t as easy to spot compared to checking your oil or your exhaust, it?s a foolproof way to diagnose the problem.Simply pull your spark plugs and look over each one carefully. If you notice any oil or coolant residue on the tip of the spark plug, that means you have a problem, and it?s likely a blown head gasket.4. Check the RadiatorRadiator Cap OpenThere are a few different things you can look for by checking your radiator. First, a blown head gasket will let air into the cooling system, which will cause the radiator to have a frothy or foamy mixture.Moreover, oil and fuel could be mixed into the system. If that happens, then you?ll have a milky-colored mix when you check the radiator.5. Check Your CoolantCoolant Overflow TankYour coolant is a sealed system, which means that what you put in your system should stay there. And while the levels can fluctuate slightly due to differences in temperature and pressure, they should stay the same for the most part.So, if you find that you have to keep adding coolant to the system even though there?s no visible leak, there?s a good chance that your coolant is heading somewhere it shouldn?t inside your engine. If you have excessive smoke, it?s getting into the combustion chamber, and if you have a milky-colored oil it?s getting into the oil channels.Furthermore, just like your oil can change color if it?s mixing with the coolant, if there is oil in the coolant reservoir, you?ll notice a frothy/milky color that indicates you have a problem.If smoke comes out of the coolant reservoir when the coolant cap is off, it can also mean that compression is going into the coolant system. This can be tested with an exhaust tester also.6. Run a Compression TestCompression TestWhile this is one of the more complicated tests to run, it?s also one of the most effective. You?ll need a few specialty tools to get the job done, and you?ll have to pull the spark plugs too. When you pull the spark plugs, make sure that you take a look at them to check for coolant or oil residue. You?ll notice a drop in compression in the affected combustion chamber if you have a blown head gasket. That?s because the cylinder can never fully seal, and the excess pressure will escape.Small leaks can be very difficult to notice with this method though.7. Check For LeaksLeaking OilWhile most people are aware that a blown head gasket can send fluids to other parts of your engine, it?s less well-known that blown head gaskets can lead to external leaks. It?s all about where the leak is. If it?s towards the outside of the head gasket, you?ll have fluid dripping down the outside of your engine instead of going into different passages.This can cause smoke to come off your engine if it?s pooling up and burning off before it reaches the ground. Or, if it does reach the ground you should notice fluid puddling up underneath your vehicle.This fluid can be either coolant or oil, and the only way to diagnose it as a bad head gasket is to trace it back to the leak?s source. If you do find that it?s coming from the head gasket, you?ve found your problem!"
Conclusion	"The easiest way to determine if the coolant is leaking into the oil or the combustion chambers is by using a cooling system pressurize tool.Just connect it and let it be pressurized for 10 minutes. The pressure should be stable, as the coolant system should be sealed. If the pressure is dropping, it is mostly leaking into the oil or the cylinders.Remove the spark plugs and check for signs of coolant in the cylinders. Also, check the dipstick for any signs of coolant in the oil pan."
what are the Causes of a Sputtering Car Engine ?	"The most common reason why your car engine is sputtering is because of an issue with the fuel system. This can be caused by a bad fuel filter, fuel pump, or fuel injector. It can also be caused by spark issues from bad spark plugs or ignition coils.While these are not all possible causes, it?s a good start. Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of car engine sputter.1. Faulty spark plugsWet Spark PlugSpark plugs are vital to providing the necessary ignition for the air/fuel mixture. However, plugs wear out and can no longer function as intended.In this case, you will have lots of unburnt fuel, which causes misfires and the engine to sputter. The spark plugs should most often be replaced after a fixed schedule to prevent things like this from happening. However, if you haven?t replaced them at the time, they should be ? faulty spark plugs can cause your engine to sputter.Remove and visually inspect your spark plugs; if they look ancient and dirty, it may be time to replace them. You should also consider checking the ignition coils, which could cause the same issues.2. Clogged fuel filterDirty Fuel FilterThe fuel filter?s job is to filter the fuel going to the fuel injectors and then enter the engine. A clogged fuel filter can cause the engine to get too low fuel pressure or cause a clogged fuel injector.Low fuel pressure will cause the engine to run very leanly, and therefore, it may cause the engine to sputter.The fuel filter should be replaced after a schedule, and if you haven?t done so during the last service, it may need a replacement. Fuel filters are most often easy to replace and do not cost too much.3. Faulty Fuel PumpCars Fuel PumpThe same thing applies to the fuel pump as the fuel filter. If the fuel pump gets bad, it will cause the fuel pressure to drop very low, which can cause the engine to run too lean.The easiest way to determine this is to install a temporary manual fuel pressure gauge to the fuel pressure rail and check the fuel pressure on idle and when you rev up.If your fuel pressure is too low, there is definitely something wrong with either the fuel filter or the fuel pump.4. Vacuum or intake leakCracked Engine Vacuum HoseIf there is a leak around the intake manifold or at the hoses from the intake manifold, it may cause a too lean mixture, which will cause your car engine to sputter on idle.The easiest way to find this is to use an EVAP smoke machine. However, it is doubtful that you have one at home, so you can also try to find leaks by listening to high-pitched noises around the engine bay when the engine runs on idle.You can also spray soap around the intake hoses to see if you can notice any leaks.5. Dirty or damaged mass airflow sensorCleaning Maf SensorThe combustion chamber requires the right amount of fuel and air. Modern engines have an onboard computer that monitors the flow of these components. The mass air flow sensors ensure that the right amount of air is supplied to the combustion chambers.When the sensors get saturated with dirt particles, they can no longer relay the ECU?s right information. This will cause the engine control unit to spray too much or too little fuel into the cylinders, which will cause the engine to sputter.You can clean the mass airflow sensor by removing it and carefully cleaning it with an electronic cleaner.6. Dirty fuel injectorsFuel InjectorsThe fuel injectors play the role of spraying fuel into the combustion chambers on each cylinder. This is then mixed with air and ignited by the spark plugs.The fuel injectors have small filters inside them, getting clogged if the fuel filter is not doing its job properly. This can cause the fuel injector to spray too little fuel into the combustion chamber, which will cause the cylinder to misfire and may cause the engine to sputter.These small filters are replaceable, and any workshop should be able to replace them for you.7. Faulty catalytic converterClogged Catalytic ConverterThe catalytic converter plays a vital role in removing harmful gases from the exhaust. The catalytic converter gets clogged if it is too old, and it can also happen that parts come loose inside of it, which will block the exhaust?s way.This will cause too high backpressure to your engine, which will cause the engine to start sputter.You can use a catalytic converter cleaner to try to clean the catalytic converter.When your catalytic converter is not working well, you will notice a strong smell of rotten eggs.8. Faulty oxygen sensorsOxygen SensorMost modern cars have an onboard computer that monitors all the engine components. Connected to this are oxygen sensors that are responsible for the regulation of fuel into the combustion chambers. A faulty oxygen sensor will cause a rich or lean mixture.With time, the oxygen sensors become contaminated with dirt, and they can no longer relay the correct information to the onboard computer. This causes them to release too much fuel or too little fuel.To diagnose the oxygen sensors, you need a diagnostic scanner."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad fuel pressure sensor are difficulty starting your car and a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice signs like poor engine performance or a stalling engine while driving.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing fuel rail pressure sensor to look for:1. Difficulty Starting your CarDifficulty Starting CarAs already mentioned, the fuel rail supplies the cylinders with the same fuel. The mechanism that ensures that the fuel rail is efficient is the fuel rail pressure sensor.If the fuel rail sensor malfunctions, it sends incorrect information to the ECU, which changes the settings, causing the fuel supply to be inadvertently interrupted, and your car takes longer to start.2. Poor Engine PerformanceSlow Acceleration CarA defective fuel rail pressure sensor will affect the performance of your ride. If you try to accelerate, your engine will not have an efficient fuel supply, resulting in poor acceleration.Not only that, if the fuel pressure sensor is faulty, it may output too little information to the ECU, which in turn may increase the amount of fuel being fed into the engine. As a result, you lose fuel and have to fill your car?s tank more frequently.3. Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light Reset ItselfThis is probably the first symptom you will notice. The check engine light is an indication that something is going wrong in your engine that needs immediate attention.This light is triggered by the ECU, which detects the defective fuel rail pressure sensor and acts accordingly. Whenever this light comes on on your dashboard, you should make a trip to the nearest mechanic.You can also read the trouble codes yourself with an OBD2 scanner.4. Stalling EngineEngine Stall E1609780473516An improper supply of fuel to the engine will cause an unexpected stall. No matter what you try, the engine will often not start again. If this happens frequently, the fuel rail pressure sensor might not be working well enough to send the correct information to the vehicle?s onboard computer.If the ECU is unable to make adjustments, your vehicle is at high risk of developing otherwise avoidable problems.5. Bad fuel consumptionBad Fuel ConsumptionAnother symptom you can notice is a different fuel consumption than you are used to having. It can either be higher fuel consumption or lower consumption than usual. Lower fuel consumption might sound like a good thing, but it can actually damage your engine."
where the Fuel Pressure Sensor Location ?	"The fuel rail pressure sensor is located on the fuel rail, which is often located near or under the intake manifold. In some car models, the fuel rail pressure sensor can also be installed on the fuel line, but this is quite rare.Check somewhere under the intake manifold, and I?m sure that you will find the injectors, fuel rail, and the fuel rail pressure sensor."
how to make Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor Testing ?	"The fuel rail pressure sensor is a component in a car's fuel system that measures the pressure of fuel in the fuel rail. If the sensor is malfunctioning or damaged, it can cause a range of engine performance issues, such as decreased fuel economy or hard starting. Here are the steps to test a fuel rail pressure sensor:Tools required:MultimeterService manual (for the specific make and model of the vehicle)Testing the fuel rail pressure sensor:Locate the fuel rail pressure sensor on the engine. It is usually located on the fuel rail or on the fuel line.Disconnect the electrical connector from the sensor.Use a multimeter to check the resistance of the sensor. The resistance should be within the range specified in the vehicle's service manual.If the resistance is not within the specified range, replace the sensor.Use the multimeter to check the voltage output of the sensor. Connect the positive lead of the multimeter to the signal wire of the sensor and the negative lead to a ground. Turn the ignition key to the ""on"" position without starting the engine, and observe the voltage output. The voltage output should be within the range specified in the service manual.If the voltage output is not within the specified range, replace the sensor.If the voltage output is within the specified range, check the fuel pressure using a fuel pressure gauge. Connect the gauge to the fuel rail and turn the ignition key to the ""on"" position without starting the engine. The fuel pressure should be within the range specified in the service manual.If the fuel pressure is not within the specified range, check the fuel pump and fuel filter for proper operation. If the fuel pump and fuel filter are working properly, there may be a blockage in the fuel lines or a malfunctioning fuel pressure regulator.Note: Before testing the fuel rail pressure sensor, it is important to check the service manual for any specific testing procedures or cautions. Some sensors may require special equipment or testing procedures. It is also important to wear appropriate safety gear, such as eye protection, when working with engine components."
what is the Fuel Pressure Sensor Replacement Cost?	"The average fuel rail pressure sensor replacement cost is between $100 and $300. A fuel rail pressure sensor will cost you $50 to $150, depending on your car model. The labor costs 50$ to 150$, depending on the workshop.You can absolutely save money by doing it yourself. Replacement of the fuel pressure sensor is often very straightforward on most car models.Remember that you will handle fuel, though, which can ignite if you are unlucky and not cautious.In some car models, you also have to reprogram the fuel pressure sensor and remove the trouble codes with a diagnostic tool after replacement."
What happens if the fuel rail pressure sensor goes bad?	"If your fuel pressure sensor goes bad, the first thing that will happen is that your check engine light will appear on your dashboard. You can also notice strange problems with the performance of your car engine."
How can I tell if a fuel pressure sensor is bad?	You can tell that your fuel pressure sensor is bad by seeing a check engine light on the dashboard. You can also check the values coming from it with a diagnostic scanner or by measuring it with a multimeter.
How do I test a fuel rail pressure sensor?	"You can test the fuel rail pressure sensor either with a diagnostic scanner or a multimeter. Connect the diagnostic scanner and check the values coming from it. Compare the values to the values you find in the repair manual. You can also check the sensor with a multimeter, but you need to get the given sensor?s right measurement values. Find out more on this video."
Can I clean fuel rail pressure sensor?	"You can clean the sensor, but it is doubtful that it will make a difference. In some very rare cases, dirt can block the passage to the sensor head, which will make the sensor work again after a clean. However, in most cases, you need to replace the fuel pressure sensor."
Will the Check engine light reset itself?	"The check engine light probably won?t reset itself unless you fix the problem. However, if you fix the problem, it may reset itself ? but it may take some time. A car usually needs 10-20 successful cycles before it resets the check engine light.A cycle is when you start your car cold and drive it until it is warm and then switch off the engine and are done with your driving.If you are sure that you have fixed the problem causing the check engine light, the engine light will reset itself after 10-20 successful cycles, and as you can imagine, 10-20 successful cycles can take a lot of time. In this case, it?s much more convenient to reset the check engine light with an OBD2 scanner."
What if the check engine light won?t reset itself?	"If you have been driving for a long time with many successful cycles after you fixed the issue without problems, but the engine control module still doesn?t reset the check light, you must understand that some car models will not reset the check light by itself; you need to reset it with a scanner.Although a scanner may sound like an expensive tool, you can actually get a pretty good scanner for cheap these days that can save you a lot of money instead of going to a mechanic every time you need to see or reset the engine codes.You can also go to a mechanic and ask if they can reset the codes for free, and many will happily do that because for them it will take 5 minutes and they may win a customer."
Why I should not ignore the check engine light ?	"If there is a small problem with your car that causes the warning light to come on on the car?s dashboard, but it does not affect the performance of the engine, most people will just ignore it and keep driving.However, this is a bad move. Even if it was only a small problem that caused the check light to come on, it means that you will not realize quickly enough if there is a more serious problem with your engine that causes the check light to come on.For some problems ? like bad camshaft timing ? a check engine light might be the only symptom of something severe enough to eventually destroy your entire engine. Therefore, you should always fix the problem, even if it is only a small problem that caused the indicator light."
How long does it take for the engine light to reset?	"It usually takes between 10 to 20 successful cycles or starts before the check engine light resets. A successful cycle is a complete warm-up of the engine without problems. Therefore, it is much faster to reset the warning light with an OBD2 scanner."
How can I get my check engine light to go off?	"The easiest way to reset the check engine light is with a scanner, which will give you an immediate result. Otherwise, you will have to wait a long time after repairing the problem, and it may reset itself. If you have an older car, you can also try disconnecting the negative battery cable."
Do car codes clear themselves?	Yes. The error codes clear themselves after a number of successful test cycles. The number of successful test cycles required depends on the car model and engine control module but is usually between 10 and 20 cycles.
How do O reset the check engine light with the gas pedal?	"In most car models, you cannot reset the warning light with the accelerator pedal. However, you can try fully depressing the gas pedal and hold it, turning the ignition on, and depressing the brake pedal seven times, then turning the ignition off. This will reset the codes in some car models, but will not work in most of them."
Conclusion	"So you probably understood how the engine control module works along with the check engine light and the successful cycles. What you should remember is that any time you work on the engine control module and warning lights, it will help tremendously if you have a diagnostic scanner available.I hope this article helped you with your car problems and that you now have the right knowledge to fix your check engine light problems."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Fuel Gauge Sending Unit ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad fuel gauge sender include erratic behavior, as well as reading empty or too full. Any time the fuel gauge acts up, it could be caused by a failing sending unit. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing fuel gauge sender to look for:1. Erratic Gauge BehaviorFuel GaugeThe fuel gauge should never make quick changes or operate erratically. When it?s operating correctly, the fuel gauge is going to consistently move toward empty until you refill the tank.However, when the fuel gauge sender starts to fail, you might notice different behavior. The gauge could suddenly alter its position or supply you with an inaccurate reading. One minute you might notice the tank is three-quarters of the way full, and the next, it is reading empty. While there could be an electrical problem with the instrument cluster, a bad fuel gauge sender is most often to blame. 2. Gauge Stuck on EmptyIt?s also possible for the fuel tank to read empty even when it?s not. If you?ve put fuel into the tank, but the gauge doesn?t move, this is a clear sign that the sending unit has failed.When the float breaks or gets separated from the arm, the gauge malfunctions. With nothing to read, it shows an empty tank. Additionally, a faulty resistor in the system can also cause this malfunction. 3. Gauge Stuck on Full While it is less common, the gauge can also show full when the sender is bad. Having a fuel gauge stuck at full is often a sign of a bad resistor instead.The resistor sends the wrong signal to the instrument panel, giving you the full tank indication. However, if the resistor isn?t to blame, it?s possible that the sender is the culprit instead. "
where the Fuel Gauge Sender Location ?	The fuel gauge sender is found inside the fuel tank on your vehicle. It will be attached directly to the fuel pump.You will locate the sender because it has a base that contains a float and rod attached to it. This float is hollow in design and lightweight. It?s meant to sit on the fuel surface and it doesn?t sink. The rod attaches directly to the base and contains a rheostat meter to register how much fuel is in your car?s tank. 
how to make Fuel Gauge Sender Testing ?	"The fuel gauge sender is a component in a car's fuel system that measures the amount of fuel in the fuel tank and sends a signal to the fuel gauge on the dashboard. If the sender is malfunctioning or damaged, it can cause inaccurate readings on the fuel gauge. Here are the steps to test a fuel gauge sender:Tools required:MultimeterService manual (for the specific make and model of the vehicle)Testing the fuel gauge sender:Locate the fuel gauge sender on the fuel tank. It is usually accessible from underneath the vehicle.Disconnect the electrical connector from the sender.Use a multimeter to check the resistance of the sender. The resistance should be within the range specified in the vehicle's service manual.If the resistance is not within the specified range, replace the sender.Use a multimeter to check the continuity of the sender. Connect the positive lead of the multimeter to the sender's signal wire and the negative lead to a ground. Move the float arm up and down and observe the multimeter reading. The reading should change as the float arm moves.If the multimeter reading does not change, replace the sender.Check the wiring and connections between the sender and the fuel gauge on the dashboard. Make sure that the wiring is secure and free of corrosion.If the wiring and connections are working properly, replace the fuel gauge on the dashboard.Note: Before testing the fuel gauge sender, it is important to check the service manual for any specific testing procedures or cautions. Some senders may require special equipment or testing procedures. It is also important to wear appropriate safety gear, such as eye protection, when working with engine components."
what is the  Function of a Fuel Gauge Sender  ?	"As you fill the gas tank, the float sits on top of what is added. As the float moves up, the rod attached to it also moves. The coil on the rod measures the resistance to determine how much fuel is in the tank. When the float is low, the resistance is also low, allowing the electrical current to move quickly. When the float is higher, the resistance is also high, causing the electrical current to move slower.The fuel gauge measures the resistance of the sender. The lower the resistance, the closer the fuel gauge gets to the empty (E) sign on the dashboard. If the resistance is all the way at the top of the spectrum, this indicates that the fuel tank is full (F). However, all of the locations between the empty and full marks are all measured, ensuring you know exactly how much fuel is in the system. "
what is the Fuel Gauge Sender Replacement Cost ?	"The average cost to replace a fuel gauge sender is between $800 and $1,000. The labor costs around $150 to $200, while the parts account for $650 and $800.These replacement costs vary based on what type of car you drive and how difficult the installation is. If you are mechanically inclined and have the right tools, you can replace the fuel gauge sender yourself and save money on the labor expenses.You can drive a vehicle with a bad fuel gauge sender. However, you won?t have an accurate reading showing how much fuel is in the gas tank. Some people choose to use the trip meter to measure how much fuel is left, but this method isn?t reliable. You might think that you can simply carry a portable tank of fuel in the trunk, but this option is dangerous because of the exposure to fumes and potential fire risk."
Reasons For A Check Engine Light On But No Codes ?	"If your check engine light is on but can?t see any codes, it?s most likely due to having the wrong scanner or one that is incompatible with your vehicle. There could also be an electrical short or blown fuse causing the light to come on for no reason.Here is a more detailed list of the most common reasons why your check engine light is on but no codes:1. Wrong Code ScannerDiagnostics E1629754686101No two code scanners are the same. You can find plenty of low-cost diagnostic scanners on the market that read the most basic codes, but these aren?t going to give you everything you need with the emissions system or transmission. Additionally, if you choose to go to a local auto parts store for a free code scan, the workers there aren?t busting out an expensive diagnostic tool. Instead, you are getting a basic scan that might not encompass the codes that are set.You can find some good scanner alternatives here: The Best OBD2 Scanners2. Electrical ShortIt?s unlikely that there?s an electrical short causing your trouble, but not impossible. If a short has occurred somewhere in the system, power could be jumping to the light, forcing it to be on.You can confirm if this is the case by turning the key to the On position without starting the engine. The light should go off after a few seconds. If it doesn?t, a short might be the problem. 3. User ErrorWhile you may think you have automotive diagnostics in the bag, there?s always the chance that you missed something. Even though the code reader is a simple tool to use, you can?t overlook the possibility that you did something wrong.Take a moment to re-read the owner?s manual of your scan tool. Follow the instructions, no matter how simple they may be. It?s possible you overlooked something basic.4. Blown FuseWhen the code scanner is plugged into its port but nothing is reading, you might think about trashing the OBD2 device. Don?t get rid of it quite yet, because a blown fuse might be to blame.The engine control module (ECM), electronic control unit (ECU), and powertrain control module (PCM) all run off of a fuse, just like the other electrical devices in your vehicle. If the fuse blows, juice cannot get to the required component. The light might come on, even though there?s no actual fault. Read the owner?s manual to figure out which fuses you should check. 5. Contaminated PortWhen you are ready to use the OBD2 scanner, you plug it into the appropriate port located under the dashboard. If the scanner isn?t working or pulling codes, there could be an issue with the connection itself.Examine the OBD port to see if dust or debris has contaminated the connector. Thankfully, this should be an easy repair that only takes you a few seconds to fix."
What is the Check Engine Light?	"The Check Engine Light is otherwise known as the Malfunction Indicator Lamp. This light comes on the dashboard to alert you to an issue with the engine computer on your vehicle. Check Engine Lights can appear in a variety of colors, depending on the manufacturer. Usually, this light will be yellow, orange, or amber. If the light comes on solid, there?s an error code that needs to be read. However, if the light is flashing, it?s an indication that something major is happening that requires attention immediately. "
What is an OBDII Code Scanner?	"OBD2 stands for Onboard Diagnostics II. This advanced diagnostics system has been included in every vehicle since 1996. The technology allows you to check the engine and other vital systems to determine what issues are prevalent. OBD systems remain standard across all new car makes and models. With this system, there?s one universal connector used so the device can read a multitude of vehicles. If you plan to monitor the health of your vehicle, an OBD2 scanner is essential to reading engine codes. However, different code readers are meant to diagnose various systems, which is why you have to be careful which one you purchase. "
How to Fix Check Engine Light With No Codes ?	"The first place to start is by looking at the code scanner. Are you using the right scanner and is it capable of reading a multitude of codes? If you haven?t invested in a high-quality scanner, now might be the time. Of course, the scanner might also be defective. Try it out on another vehicle to see if it?s working properly. If not, it?s time to replace it. You also want to check the port where you are plugging it in. If there?s debris clogging up the connection, use some compressed air to clean it out. Your next step would be to check for a blown fuse. The layout of fuses can be found in the owner?s manual. Look for the fuse that?s running the ECU, ECM or PCM and check to see if it?s been blown. If so, replacing the fuse should only cost you a few dollars and the Check Engine Light should go away.Anything beyond these simple fixes might require a professional. If you aren?t sure how to hunt down an electrical short, you may want to take it into the shop for further inspection."
What are the differences between a V6 and V8 Engine?	"The main difference between the V6 and the V8 engine is the number of cylinders it has, which affects the performance and fuel consumption. The V8 engine is often the more powerful engine, but with higher fuel consumption and a heavier weight than the V6.While this is just a quick answer, there is much more to it. Keep on reading to find out everything you have to know about this!"
What is the ?V? in Engine Terminology?	"Auto manufacturers create many different types of engines by creating a particular size and number of cylinders. The way the cylinders are designed in an engine can be in a ?V? shape, which is why they are called V6 and V8 engines. Inside the V-type motor, you will find the cylinders arranged among two symmetrical rows. In the V6 engine, you will find two rows containing three cylinders each, while the V8 contains two rows of four cylinders each. Both of the engine types are well balanced and created for optimal performance. You can find either one in some of your favorite sports cars or pickup trucks because of what they can produce. "
Pros of V6 and. V8 Engines ?	"If you have been considering buying a vehicle with a V6, you can expect several benefits. Similar HorsepowerTowing Capability is GoodBetter HandlingMore Fuel EfficientLower Cost1. Similar HorsepowerUpgrading to a V8 engine from a V6 won?t make a dramatic difference in horsepower. For example, a 2021 Ford F-150 with a twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6 produces 325 horsepower, while the available V8 engine only bumps that to 400 horsepower. While that is a slight increase, it might not be worth the additional price to most consumers. For everyday driving, the V6 is going to provide more than enough power to get the job done. Plus, it offers more than the standard 4-cylinder while providing a more compact design. 2. Towing Capability is GoodIt?s become clear that modern vehicles do not need to have a powerful V8 engine to tow a lot. In fact, the 2021 Ford Expedition includes a 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6 engine that can tow up to 9,300 pounds. This is the highest rating in its class, all without a V8 engine. You also can?t find the same type of towing capacity out of a 4-cylinder engine. 3. Better HandlingThe V6 engine weighs less than the V8 engine. While it does create more stability, you will notice a bigger difference while navigating corners, turns and curves. With two fewer cylinders, you get the performance you need without the added mass. While the V8 engine might try to drift more during a turn, the V6 can corner nimbly. This is an important feature whether you are speeding down a country road in your sports car or taking the kids to school in your large SUV. 4. More Fuel EfficientThe majority of V6 engines will burn through less fuel than the larger V8. This fuel savings means you spend less time at the pump and get to keep more money in your pocket.You can see this with the 2021 Ford F-150 lineup again. The smaller EcoBoost V6 engine is rated at 20/26 mpg, while the larger V8 gets 17/24 mpg instead. 5. Lower CostAside from the fuel savings, you will also pay less to drive a car with a V6 engine. It costs less to manufacture, which is why it will almost always have a lower starting price than the same car with a V8. Plus, your cost of maintenance is reduced. With fewer cylinders, you have fewer parts to replace and less that could go wrong. "
Pros of V8 and V6 Engines ?	"However, there are several advantages that the V8 has to offer over the V6.Higher Power CeilingBetter Acceleration & SpeedBest for Hauling1. Higher Power CeilingEven though we?ve shown that many of the modern V6 engines can provide nearly the same amount of power as the V8, they can?t compete with the maximum capacity of the larger engine. You will be able to get the most power from a V8 engine.Take the 6.2L HEMI High-Output Hellcat Redeye V8 engine that outputs 797 horsepower as an example. This is power that no V6 engine can stand toe-to-toe with. 2. Better Acceleration & SpeedThe V8 is designed for being pushed. When you step on the gas pedal, you can expect a quick response and access to the power you need.Not only will the V8 engine have a higher top speed than a comparable V6, but it is better equipped to produce faster acceleration times. For example, the 2021 Chevy Camaro with the 3.6-liter V6 has a 5.4-second 0-60 mph time, while the 6.2-liter supercharged V8 offers a 3.5-second 0-60 mph time. 3. Best for HaulingIf you plan to consistently haul heavy goods, you will likely find that the V8 engine offers better performance. It?s meant to hold heavy loads with ease.The V8 engine won?t be as strained as the V6 engine when the cargo hold is full. Even with the majority of V6 upgrades, you will find V8 engines often have a higher payload capacity. "
V6 and V8 ? Which Is Better?	"If you are looking for a fast and powerful engine with good exhaust sound, the V8 engine is a better choice for you. If you want a mix of power, lower fuel consumption, and a cheaper car, then the V6 engine is a better choice for you.After looking at the pros and cons of the V6 vs. V8 engines, you might already know which is better for you. To determine which will fit your needs the best, you must determine what you plan to use your vehicle for. If you want the lowest price possible while creating superior handling, the V6 might be best for you. It also helps you save money at the fuel pump. However, if you plan to do a lot of heavy hauling, the V8 might be better for you. Plus, it?s an ideal choice if you are looking for the maximum speed in your sports car and aren?t worried about the price. "
How to Reset Check Engine Light ?	"The easiest way to reset the check engine light is by using an OBD2 scanner. But if you don?t have one available, try disconnecting the battery, cycling the ignition, pulling a fuse, or letting it go away on its own.If the Engine Check Light ReturnsOnce you have successfully reset your check engine light, you are ready to go. But if your check engine light turns on again after a few days, it means there is a problem in your car that needs to get fixed.It is now time to get your car diagnosed for real with a scanner. Either by buying one yourself or going to a workshop that can read the codes in your car.Here are some more detailed steps on how to reset your check engine light:Total Time: 5 minutesUse an OBD2 ScannerReset Engine LightIf you have an OBD2 scanner available, you can reset your Check Engine Light within seconds. To get one, you can check out our other article on the best OBD2 scanners to buy.When your check engine light is on, connect the scanner to the OBD connector situated under most car models? steering portion. Then switch on your car?s ignition to the ON position. After the connection is established between the computer and the car, press the ?read? button on the scanner to search for all the stored trouble codes.After the scan is complete, note down all error codes diagnosed by the scanner, decode those problems using the user manual of the particular make and model. Once the code is decoded, the problem is detected. Solve that problem; if that part needs to change, then change it, and if it needs to be calibrated, then calibrate it.Once you have solved any problems, erase the error from the scanner by pressing the ?Erase/Clear? button. Once the problem is solved, it is recommended to switch off the ignition, then switch it again, check to see that the engine check light is not on again, and recheck from the scanner whether it is giving the same fault again or not.Battery Disconnection TechniqueDisconnect Car BatteryThe best way to reset the check engine light without a scan tool is by removing the battery terminal for 30-60 seconds. This will reset the engine control unit in many car models.First, remove the negative car battery terminal. Then try to drain any available electricity present in the car?s capacitor by pressing the horn for around 20-30 seconds or turning on the lights. Once the electricity is disconnected, then leave your car for 10-15 mins. After this short time, reconnect the battery terminals, make sure they are well tightened to avoid any possible sparking, and then switch on your car.If your car gives that same check engine light after restarting, then it means there is some serious problem in your car, or your car stores the codes anyway. In such a case, it is highly recommended to check the codes with a scanner instead because some car models will not reset the codes by removing the power.Turning the Ignition On and Off Turn IgnitionSwitching the ignition on and off is also one method of hard reset without disconnecting the battery. Put the keys in your ignition and turn your ignition on and off consecutively after a second in each step.Once it is done, see if the engine check light is still coming on or not. If the check light is off, you are ready to go, but if it is still coming on, get ready by reading the codes with a scanner instead.Let it Go Off ItselfDriving CarAnother way to reset the check engine light is to wait and let it go off by itself. It is a straightforward method; you have only to wait and continue driving your car for around three days. Cars? computers work in a continuous cycle and refresh their present state.Remember that you have to make sure that the problem is gone before using this technique.For example, if the ECU detects a problem in the oxygen sensor that could occur due to a minor glitch, then it might fix automatically as the ECU will update the sensor?s status once the glitch is removed, turning off the check engine light. But if your check light is still on even after three days, then either apply the above-mentioned methods yourself or take your car to a mechanic. Read more about it here: Will the check engine light reset itself?Pulling Off the Fuse and Put It backPull FuseOne way to get your check engine light to turn off is to pull off the engine control unit?s fuse and then put it back again. Although this won?t solve the problem in newer cars, it may solve the problem in older cars, and it is easy to try. Check your repair manual to find the fuse to the engine control unit."
Can I reset the check engine light without disconnecting the battery?	"You can reset the check engine light without disconnecting the battery by using an OBD2 scanner. If you drive long enough after fixing the problem, most car models? check engine light will go away by itself."
How do I reset my check engine light without a scanner?	"The best way to reset the check engine light without a scanner is to repair the problem and keep driving for an extended period. In some car models, you can also remove the battery terminals to reset the engine control unit."
How long does it take for the check engine light to reset?	"If you are sure you have fixed the problem, it takes around 10-30 successful cycles before the check engine light disappears. A successful cycle is defined as going from a cold start until the engine is warm."
Will the check engine light go off by itself?	"Yes. The check engine light will reset itself after a fixed amount of time if you fixed the problem in most car models. Usually, this is 10-30 cycles. One cycle is from a cold start until the engine is at working temperature."
Conclusion	"The most efficient way to reset a check engine light is by using a diagnostic scanner to clear the trouble code memory. There are also some other methods you can try, but most of them won?t work in modern car models. You can also drive for a long time after fixing the problem, and the check engine light will disappear by itself.A simple trick you can try to reset the check engine light is to pull the fuse to the engine control module or disconnect the car battery, if you have an old car. However, this won?t work in most newer car models.If you frequently deal with check engine lights or other warning lights, it is much more worthwhile to invest in a code scanner to reset the codes within seconds without having to disconnect batteries or pull fuses. If you have a workshop, having one is definitely a no-brainer."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Coolant Temperature Sensor?	"The most common symptoms of a bad coolant temperature sensor include poor mileage, cooling fans not coming on, engine performance issues, an overheating engine, and a check engine light on your dashboard.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing coolant temperature sensor to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightOne of the first signs of all coolant temperature sensor symptoms you will probably notice is that the check engine light will show up on your dashboard.If the computer detects any problem with the sensor?s circuit, it will illuminate the check engine light, indicating that the car needs an inspection.If you see a check engine light on your dashboard, it is time to check the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner.2. Poor MileageBad Fuel ConsumptionA faulty ECT sensor can send a false signal to the onboard computer, resulting in an incorrect air-fuel mixture. For example, a faulty sensor can send a signal indicating the engine is cold when it is not, and more fuel will heat the engine quickly.This will cause the fuel economy to drop and decrease the engine?s performance.3. Electrical Cooling Fans not coming onCooling Fans Radiator CarSome cars use the engine coolant temperature sensor to control the electric cooling fans. In most cars, you have two separate temperature sensors for the fans, a dashboard gauge, and engine management.However, if your car has a single sensor, a bad engine coolant temperature sensor may result in your fans not starting.4. Black Smoke from the Exhaust PipeBlack Smoke CarDue to an incorrect engine temperature signal, the ECU may enrich the fuel mixture to a point where the combustion process becomes difficult.The excessive fuel will burn in the exhaust pipe and will produce thick black smoke.5. Hard Start ConditionStarting CarThe amount of fuel getting injected into the engine is critical at the moment you start your car. If the air-fuel mixture is faulty, you might find your car difficult or impossible to start.6. Engine OverheatsOverheating Engine On RoadThe cooling fan, which is behind the radiator grille, removes heat from the engine?s coolant. This fan is electrically controlled and relies on the signal from the onboard computer.If the fan receives a false signal, the fan might not turn on, causing the engine to overheat. Some vehicles have a separate coolant temperature sensor for the fan, but many cars use the same sensor.7. Poor IdlingCar Engine Rough IdleDue to a faulty ECT sensor, the fuel mixture will adjust. This will cause the engine to vibrate or shake when the car is at low speed and lead to other power losses and strange behaviors.The engine is very sensitive to wrong air-fuel mixtures at idle, and this is a condition when you might notice that something is wrong with your engine coolant temperature sensor.8. Poor Engine performanceSlow Car AccelerationThe engine coolant temperature sensor can have a hard impact on the air-fuel mixture. A bad air-fuel mixture can also cause the engine performance to drop drastically.If you feel that the engine performance is not what it has been before, it may be due to a faulty engine coolant temperature sensor."
What is an Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor?	"Coolant temperature sensors are also known as engine coolant temperature sensors or ECT sensors. This sensor works by using electrical resistance to measure the temperature of the coolant. These measurements produce essential data for the engine system of your vehicle.The readings produced from the coolant temperature sensor are transmitted to the engine control unit, where they are utilized as data for regulating and maintaining the proper ignition time and the optimal fuel injection through the computerized approach."
where the Coolant Temperature Sensor Location?	"The engine coolant temperature sensor is usually located on the engine block or cylinder head. It is often installed on a plastic hose on the coolant?s inlet.Different brands and car manufacturers have different ways of placing the coolant temperature sensor depending on the car?s design.Some vehicles may have more than one temperature sensor, as sometimes, different sensors are used to signal to the dashboard, cooling fan control, and the control unit of your engine system.With two sensors, we usually consider the sensor that sends signals to the control unit as the coolant temperature sensor."
what is the Coolant Temperature Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"The average coolant temperature sensor replacement cost is between $50 and $250, depending on the car model and labor costs. A coolant temperature sensor costs $30 to $100, and the labor costs $20 to $150.The coolant temperature sensor itself is often quite cheap, and you can often find them for around $40 for a quality one. There are cheaper ones on the market, but I heavily recommend buying a quality one like Bosch to skip the headaches.The replacement is also often quite straightforward, except that you might have to pour out all the coolant from the engine and refill it. Unfortunately, removing the coolant also means that you have to remove all air from the coolant system, which can be difficult.However, if you are fast with replacing the sensor, there is often no need to tap out the coolant, but this requires some skill.Remember to always make sure the coolant temperature is low when doing this kind of work!!"
How to Diagnose a Faulty Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor?	"To diagnose the coolant temperature sensor, you need a repair manual for your car model to find what measurement values you should expect from the coolant temperature sensor.Connect an OBD2 Scanner and look for related trouble codes. Check the live data to see the temperature from the sensor. If it is way off the range, check the wirings, and replace the sensor.Locate the coolant temperature sensor in your vehicle by referring to the service manual.Find the coolant temperature sensor and remove the connector plugs.If you have two pins on the coolant temperature sensor, you can try measuring the ohm value between these two pins.Check your repair manual for the correct ohm value at a given temperature.If the value is wrong, replace the sensor.If it seems fine, check the wirings and connectors between the coolant temperature sensor and the engine control module."
How long does it take to replace a coolant temperature sensor?	"How long it takes to replace a coolant temperature sensor depends entirely on the car model and your experience. However, most coolant temperature sensors take about 30 to 60 minutes to replace."
Will the engine coolant temperature sensor keep a car from starting?	"Yes, a bad coolant temp sensor can prevent the engine from starting. For example, if it?s very cold outside, but the sensor tells the ECM that it?s warm, it won?t inject enough fuel to start the engine."
Do I have to drain the coolant to replace the temperature sensor?	"Yes, in most car models you need to drain the coolant to replace the temp sensor. In some car models, the sensor is located very high up on the engine and in these situations, you can sometimes switch the new sensor over quickly so you don?t have to empty the entire system. Only work on your car engine when the coolant is cold."
Is there a fuse for the coolant temperature sensor?	"No, you likely won?t find a fuse for the coolant temperature sensor itself. You can find a fuse for the engine control module though, which sends the signal to the coolant temperature sensor."
Conclusion	"If you?re experiencing any of these symptoms, take your car in for a checkup as soon as possible. A bad coolant temperature sensor can cause your vehicle to overheat. This can lead to serious engine damage, so it?s important to be aware of the symptoms and get it fixed as soon as possible if you suspect that the coolant temperature sensor is bad.The good news is that replacing a coolant temp sensor is relatively quick and easy on most car models, and won?t break the bank, so you don?t have to be a professional to do the job. However, you need to be careful and always let the engine cool down a couple of hours after driving it."
what are the Symptoms Of A Cracked or Bad Intake Manifold ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad or cracked intake manifold are rough idle and a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice a loss in engine performance together with misfires. In rare cases, it may cause an external coolant leak.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or cracked intake manifold to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine Light Reset ItselfThe engine control unit is constantly monitoring your car?s sensors while you are driving it, and if any of them sends the wrong values compared to the pre-set values, the check engine light will appear on your dashboard.If you have a bad intake manifold, the air-fuel mixture will be different than what it is supposed to be, and therefore the check engine light will show up on your dashboard.When the check engine light shows up, there is also a trouble code stored in the engine control unit that you need to read to continue the troubleshooting.2. MisfiresMisfiresWhen there is a crack or a coolant leak in the intake manifold, it will result in an extra amount of air compared to fuel entering the combustion chamber. This will result in misfires, which happen when the combustion process gets disturbed and is not completed.This can also happen due to coolant water in the cylinder coming from an internal crack in the intake manifold or around the intake manifold gasket. If you have misfires, you will also often find a related trouble code in the engine control module.3. Rough IdleCar Engine Rough IdleAs you may know by now, a bad or cracked intake manifold will cause the air-fuel mixture to go bad. A bad air-fuel mixture can also cause your idle to become rough.The engine is susceptible to problems at idle because it needs to run perfectly to hold a steady RPM. This is why you will most likely first notice an intake manifold problem at idle.4. Loss in Engine PerformanceSlow CarWhen the intake manifold fails, the fuel and air ratio is affected. We all know how important the air-fuel mixture is for efficient combustion, so any effect on this mixture can affect your car?s fuel consumption.You will find that it will burn more fuel, and you will have to refill the fuel tank more often. Not only that, but you will also feel that your car is not accelerating properly and that the engine may have hiccups.Whenever this happens, you need to check the intake manifold for any signs of leaks.5. External coolant leaksCoolant LeakIf the intake manifold suffers from an internal crack or a problem near the intake manifold gasket, the coolant can start to leak out in the engine bay.If you have a pool of coolant under your car after a night in the garage, it is definitely time to check for any signs of leaks around the intake manifold.Often the leak comes from under the intake manifold, which can be really difficult to spot.6. Engine OverheatingEngine OverheatingIf the intake manifold has a crack and causes the coolant to pour out in the engine bay or into the combustion chamber, the engine?s first effect starts to overheat due to the loss of coolant.You will see this while driving when the temperature gauge rises on your dashboard, and it is advisable to see the mechanic as soon as this happens, as an overheated engine can seize up and stop working completely.The best way to detect this is to check the coolant level in the engine bay regularly. If you notice that it has slowly started to decrease, it is time to check for coolant leaks.Learn more about overheating here: Overheating car engine."
what is The Function of the intake manifold ?	"The purpose of the intake manifold is to deliver an even amount of air into the car engine?s cylinders.In older cars, the carburetor injected fuel before the intake manifold, and for these engines, the intake manifold needed to spread this fuel evenly.Newer cars inject fuel at the end of the intake manifold with fuel injectors, and the even spread is not as important anymore as it was before.Newer cars even have swirl flaps inside them, creating a better air-swirl when entering the combustion chamber, which creates a more efficient engine."
where the Intake Manifold Location? 	"The intake manifold is located on the cylinder head on one side of the engine. In V-engines, the intake manifold is located in the middle between the cylinder heads.The intake manifold is very easy to spot in most car engines because it is often installed high up in the engine bay.In some cars, you need to remove some plastic covers to see it first, though. They are often made of plastic or metal, so look out for a part that looks like the picture above to spot it.If you know how many cylinders your car has, look for a part with the same amount of pipes as your car?s cylinders."
how to make Intake Manifold Testing ?	"The intake manifold is a component in a car's engine that distributes air and fuel to the cylinders. If the intake manifold is damaged or malfunctioning, it can cause a range of engine performance issues, such as decreased power and fuel economy or rough idling. Here are the steps to test an intake manifold:Tools required:Smoke machineService manual (for the specific make and model of the vehicle)Testing the intake manifold:Consult the service manual for the specific testing procedures and cautions for the make and model of the vehicle.Connect a smoke machine to the intake manifold. This will allow you to see if there are any leaks in the manifold.Block off the throttle body and all other connections to the intake manifold.Turn on the smoke machine and observe the smoke coming out of the intake manifold.If there are any leaks in the intake manifold, the smoke will be visible coming out of the leak.Use a smoke leak detection kit to identify the location of the leak. The kit contains a special dye that can be injected into the intake manifold. The dye will then be visible when the smoke is emitted, indicating the location of the leak.If there are no leaks in the intake manifold, check the intake manifold gasket and throttle body gasket for any damage or wear.If the gaskets are damaged or worn, replace them.Note: Before testing the intake manifold, it is important to check the service manual for any specific testing procedures or cautions. It is also important to wear appropriate safety gear, such as eye protection, when working with engine components."
what is the Intake Manifold Replacement Cost?	"The average intake manifold replacement cost is between $300 and $1100, depending on the car model and labor costs. An intake manifold costs $200 to $600, and the labor costs $100 to $500.This cost differs a lot depending on the car engine and car model you have. It also depends if you are looking for OEM or aftermarket parts.The cost of the intake manifold is often pricey, so if you want it a little bit cheaper, you can often look for used intake manifolds. The intake manifold is most often a piece of iron, and not many things can fail on these.However, some intake manifolds, especially on newer cars, have intake flaps inside of them, and in this case, you have to replace the whole intake manifold.Replacing the intake manifold usually takes around 1-2 hours if you have some basic knowledge and want to do it yourself. Some intake manifolds have flaps that need to be programmed after an intake manifold replacement ? especially in European cars."
Can I drive with a bad intake manifold?	"Driving with a bad intake manifold is never a good idea. If there is a leak, it will cause your air-fuel mixture to become either too rich or too lean, which can damage your engine. There is also a risk of fire if the intake manifold leaks. Ultimately, it?s best to get the problem fixed as soon as possible."
What does an intake manifold leak sound like?	"Not all intake manifold leaks will make a noise. However, an intake manifold leak will typically make a hissing noise. If you have a turbocharged car, you can also hear a whistling sound when accelerating if the manifold is leaking. The leak can also cause the engine to run rough, as it is not getting the correct mix of air and fuel."
What causes a cracked intake manifold?	"A cracked intake manifold can be caused by a number of factors, but is usually the result of heat and stress. Over time, the intense heat and pressure from the engine can cause the metal to warp and crack. On some car models, the intake manifold is made of plastic, and these manifolds are even more sensitive to heat and age."
How do I fix a broken intake manifold?	"Most of the time, it is better to replace the intake manifold instead of fixing it. However, if your intake manifold is made of aluminum, you can sometimes weld the leak or crack. If your intake manifold is plastic, it is better to replace it. If it has cracked once, it will most likely crack in a new place soon after you fix it."
How to Start a Car with a Bad Starter ?	"To start a car with a bad starter, you simply need to check the connections to find if something is loose or corroded. If the connections are secure, you can gently bang on the starter with a hammer or jump-start it to get going. If you have a manual transmission vehicle, it?s also possible to bump-start the engine. 1. Inspect the ConnectionsCorrosion Battery TerminalBefore you do anything else, you need to check the connection between the starter and the battery. If the connections are loose, the starter might not receive the proper power to operate. You should be able to easily tighten the connection on the battery terminals. While you are there, look for corrosion. If there is any, it could be interrupting the power flow. Thankfully, you can clean battery corrosion quickly with a mixture of baking soda and water. If the battery connection looks good and doesn?t have any corrosion, you want to follow the positive wire. It will split in two, with one wire going to the alternator and the other to the starter. You can shake the wire going to the starter to see if it feels loose. If there?s too much wiggle room, you want to tighten the connection. 2. Look at Engine & Body GroundsCar Ground StrapThe ground connection to the starter is supplied through the contact made with the transmission. There will be at least one ground wire connected to the car body for the transmission. If this connection were to become damaged, loose or rusty, there would be an open circuit within the starter, keeping you from getting the engine running.However, there?s always the possibility that a bad engine ground could be contributing to the problem too. It?s wise to inspect both just to be sure. You should also check the ground between the battery and your car?s body. You can use an external jumper cable between the negative battery terminal and a good grounding point on the engine to ensure the ground is good.3. Tap the StarterHammer Start CarYou?ve probably seen lots of people illustrate how to tap a starter to get it moving, but there are also many others that bang on the starter. That is not the way to handle this step.If the starter has a dead spot between the armature and field coils, a slight bang might move it beyond that spot so it can work again. If you?ve been noticing intermittent problems, this will probably get the engine started again. You can use a hammer, ratchet extension or pry bar to get the job done. Find the starter on the side of the motor and give it a good tap. Sadly, this isn?t going to work with all cars. If you have a vehicle with a transverse engine, the starter is going to be in a difficult location. You would often have to get between the firewall and the engine to tap it, as it might be under the intake or over the exhaust manifold. In this case, you might need to move on to another solution. Be very careful when doing this and ensure the car is in neutral and you are not near any moving parts.4. Inspect the Solenoid WireStarter SolenoidYou have already looked at both the ground and positive wire on the starter, which are the connections required to turn the motor. However, the solenoid is also an important aspect of the operation because it causes the starter to engage with the ring gear on the transmission. If you notice the starter is free turning while cranking, the solenoid is likely the issue.Look for the tiniest wire on the starter. First, you want to ensure that this connection is free from debris. You can bypass this wire with 12V of current coming from the battery with the help of another small wire. Be warned that there could be a click sound when the jumper wire is connected. Now, try starting the engine again to see if the solenoid is to blame. 5. Jump Start the CarJump Starting CarAt first glance, this solution doesn?t look like it?s valuable. After all, the fully-charged battery should already be supplying enough energy to the starter to get it working.With that in mind, there have been times when a jump start has worked ironically. The powerful supply of voltage might be enough to overcome that dead spot in the starter. Just don?t get your hopes up because it doesn?t work more than it does. 6. Bypass the Starter SolenoidJump Starter MotorThis old trick has been used by mechanics for years. It?s a great option if you have an older model or if the starter can be reached easily. To bypass the starter solenoid, you will need to touch a screwdriver to both the solenoid terminal and the positive terminal on the starter at the same time. The starter terminal is constantly connected to the positive terminal on the battery, allowing you to bypass the relay with this trick. What you get is 12V of current moving straight to the solenoid, allowing the circuit to close and the car to start. It is only recommended to do this with the starter on the bench for troubleshooting because it can be very dangerous! Stay away from any moving parts!7. Push-Start the CarPush Start CarThis solution only works with manual transmission vehicles, so there are limitations. However, if you have a stick shift vehicle, you can get the engine going by simply pushing the car down the road. This option works when the starter has failed or if you have a dead battery. Gather some of your friends or family and put them behind your vehicle. Have them push it while you sit in the driver?s seat. Once they get the vehicle moving at about ten mph, you can put the car in gear and try getting it started by letting go of the clutch. When you remove your foot from the pedal, the engine is going to grab the power and turn over. You might need to try this method a few times before you get the hang of it. However, you will still want to get the starter fixed even though you can get the car moving. Push starting a vehicle can cause additional wear on the drivetrain components. The last thing you want is damage to the clutch, flywheel or transmission. "
What Causes White Smoke from Engine?	"The most common cause of white smoke coming from the engine is an external coolant or oil leak. The external coolant leak could also come from an overheating engine, which pushes the coolant out of the system into the engine bay.When your combustion engine is working the way it was intended, it produces a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor. This is channeled out through the exhaust system and mostly unnoticed. However, when there is a problem with the way the engine is running, it might start burning something else. White smoke indicates some form of contamination. Instead of burning air and fuel, the engine is burning something else. Here?s a more detailed list of why there is white smoke coming from your engine:1. External Coolant LeakWhite Smoke From EngineIf the white smoke is coming from the engine bay, you most likely have an external coolant leak or an overheating engine. When coolant comes in contact with the hot part, vapor will create white smoke.Coolant leaks can be caused by a lot of different things like cracked coolant hoses or bad gaskets. If you can see a coolant leak, you can check out this article about coolant leaks to learn more.White smoke from the engine bay can also be caused by an overheating engine, where the coolant is being pushed out of the coolant system. If the smoke is coming from the exhaust and not from the engine bay, the problem most likely lies elsewhere.2. Blown Head GasketBlown Head GasketWhen the head gasket blows, coolant leaks into the engine compartment or into the exhaust pipe. If it is serious, the leak might be visible on the outside of the exhaust manifold. However, these problems often go unnoticed. Still, it will create white smoke coming from the engine. It can also cause an overheating engine, which leads to extensive engine damage. This is one of the more costly repairs to perform but it is necessary if you want to save your motor. 3. Broken Cylinder HeadCylinder HeadIf a cylinder head cracks, coolant can leak into the cylinder or combustion chamber. As it mixes with the fuel, it will create the same white smoke seen with a blown head gasket.If coolant is seeping into the engine, it can?t do its job, leaving your engine at risk of overheating. You should look in the oil or coolant reservoirs to see if there is any sign of the two mixing together. 4. Defective Fuel InjectorFuel Injector LocationThe injector ensures that there is the right amount of fuel to mix with oxygen for combustion. Most modern motors are highly calibrated to ensure nothing affects this mixture.However, if the injector isn?t working right, the mixture might receive too much fuel. Because this fuel won?t be able to burn correctly, you will notice white or grey smoke coming from the exhaust. 5. Poor Diesel Injector Pump TimingYou can also have trouble with your diesel engine if the mixture isn?t just right. If the injector pump timing is wrong, it will act just like a faulty fuel injector from a gas engine.The bad timing produces a mixture that contains too much fuel. As it goes unburned, you end up with white smoke pouring from the engine. 6. Leaking Seals/ValveThe engine is made of numerous seals and valves that must all do their job for everything to work right. If one of the piston valve seals or rings starts to go bad, oil can start leaking. Smoke from burning oil tends to have more of a blue color to it, but it is easily mistaken for white smoke. It will appear whiter when the leak is minimal, eventually turning bluer as the leak gets worse. B2495"
what are the Types of White Smoke from Engine ?	"Thin VaporYour car typically produces some vapor as part of the exhaust. If you aren?t used to seeing it or you start your vehicle on a cold day, you might be more alarmed. When temperatures drop, the exhaust steam can look more intense, sometimes being mistaken as smoke. However, if this smoke disappears quickly, you probably have nothing to worry about. Sweet-Smelling SmokeWhen the white smoke is thick and comes with a sweet smell, you can bet on a coolant leak. Coolant is very sweet. This is actually the reason you are told to keep antifreeze away from animals ? they are attracted to it and drink it because of its sweet taste. However, when coolant mixes with fuel, it burns in the engine, creating white smoke from the engine. It?s also going to produce a distinct sweet smell that is unlike any other automotive fluid. As we discussed above, a blown head gasket or cracked cylinder could cause this situation, both of which are costly repairs. Normal White SmokeIf you notice white smoke coming from the engine, but you don?t smell anything unique, it could be caused by condensation in the exhaust. Just like regular water vapor, condensation can build up in the exhaust, especially if you are just starting the vehicle in the morning.Picture dew forming on the grass. This is the same situation, but in your car exhaust. If this is the situation, it will burn up quickly. If the smoke persists, there is something wrong with your engine that should be looked at. "
what is the Engine Smoke Repair Costs ?	"The cost to repair a fault resulting in white smoke varies depending on what is causing it. As we?ve illustrated, there are several conditions that could occur. If it is something simple like a bad gasket, a replacement should cost you less than $150, with labor included. All of the other repairs tend to be pricey. For example, a leaking valve or seal could cost anywhere from $50 to $1,000. A broken fuel injector or pump could run as high as $2,000. What?s most serious is a blown head gasket or a cracked cylinder, which isn?t just costly, but also difficult to repair. Depending on what kind of car you drive, you could spend up to $2,500 to repair these problems. Whenever you see white smoke coming from the engine, you are going to want to have the problem fixed. Otherwise, you are going to end up with extensive damage to the engine that will require a complete replacement. "
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Intake Air Temperature Sensor (IAT) ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad intake air temperature sensor are engine performance issues and a check engine light on the dashboard. The performance signs you may notice are slow acceleration, hard cold start, rough idle, or misfires.This is just a quick overview, and if you want to learn more specific information, here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing intake air temperature sensor to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightThe check engine light will often appear on your dashboard when you have any issues with the IAT sensor. The engine control unit heavily monitors all sensors in a car engine, and if one fails, it will light up the check engine light immediately.If you notice a check engine light on your dashboard, check the trouble codes with an OBD2 scanner or let your mechanic do it.2. Drop in AccelerationSlow Car AccelerationDue to a faulty intake temperature sensor, the engine control module may think that the engine?s air is colder or warmer than it actually is. A false signal may cause the PCM to miscalculate the air and fuel mixture, resulting in a drop in acceleration.Colder temperatures require more fuel, which the engine control module is programmed to calculate.3. Hard Cold Start ConditionHard StartingThe starting condition is a very critical moment for your car. Your car needs a lot of and the correct amount of fuel.If your intake temperature sensor makes the engine control unit inject the wrong amount of fuel, you might find it a tough time trying to start your car.4. Rough IdleCar Engine Rough IdleIdle is also one of these conditions when the engine is susceptible to the right air-fuel mixture. This is also a condition when you can feel the faulty air intake temperature sensor?s slightly faulty air-fuel mixture.If you experience some small hiccups on idle, it can be a faulty IAT sensor.5. MisfiresMisfiring Engine E1609865653850Misfires occur when the combustion inside the engine cylinder fails. This can be caused by either a faulty spark or a wrong air-fuel mixture.You can feel misfires as hiccups or interruptions while you accelerate. If you can feel this on acceleration, there may be a problem with your IAT sensor.6. EGR Valve AffectedEgr Valve EngineIn some cars, the engine control unit uses air temperature to control the EGR valve operation. Due to a faulty IAT sensor, the function of the EGR valve can be affected too.An EGR valve that does not function properly can cause a lot of strange symptoms in your car.7. Poor Fuel EconomyBad Fuel ConsumptionIn normal conditions, the engine computer constantly adjusts the fuel and air level mixture to ensure maximum fuel efficiency.The engine control unit relies on the IAT sensor?s information, and if a false signal is sent, the fuel efficiency decreases or increases significantly.If you notice a different fuel consumption than normal, it can be because of a failed IAT sensor."
What is an Intake Air Temperature Sensor?	"The intake air temperature sensor or IAT sensor has the core function of monitoring the air temperature entering the engine of your vehicle.This information is beneficial for the engine control unit or ECU for many functions and calculations, such as calculating the air density for effective ignition timing and fuel efficiency.The computer system of your engine or the PCM requires this information to stabilize and regulate the combustion engine?s air-fuel ratio. It ensures optimum combustion and efficient fuel consumption."
Where Is the IAT Sensor location?	"The Intake Air Temperature Sensor is located somewhere on your intake pipes between the air filter and the intake manifold. It is often integrated with the MAF Sensor.Often, it is also installed on the intake manifold.The intake air temperature sensor?s location is not standard due to different locations in a variety of designs. The best way to locate the IAT sensor in your vehicle is to refer to the service manual provided by your manufacturer."
what is the Intake Temperature Sensor Diagnosis ?	"The diagnostic procedure of checking if the IAT sensor has failed is relatively easy. You can do it yourself if you have some basic knowledge and the tools available to you. Have a repair manual for your car ready.Connect the OBD2 scanner to your car. Turn on the engine.Check the live data and check the temperature of the IAT sensor. Typically, the temperature readings should be 10 degrees more or less than the vehicle?s ambient temperature, depending on the outside temperature and the engine?s temperature.If the readings are not realistic, there could be a problem with your IAT sensor or the wirings to it. If the temperature is over 300 degrees or has a low unrealistic value, check the MAF sensor/IAT wires as they can be damaged.Ohm-measure the Intake temperature sensor and make sure they are the same as your repair manual suggests. If you can find that the ohms are not correct, replace the sensor and remove the trouble codes.If the sensor seems correct, check and measure the sensor?s wirings and the engine control unit."
what is the IAT Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"The average intake temperature sensor replacement cost is between $40 and $250, depending on the car model and labor costs. An intake temperature sensor costs $20 to $150, and the labor costs $20 to $100.If your intake temperature sensor is integrated into the MAF sensor, the part cost can increase rapidly. Some MAF sensors cost up to $400.The replacement of an MAF sensor or intake temperature sensor is often very straightforward and can often be made yourself with basic knowledge.In some cars, the IAT sensor can be located under the manifold in a difficult location, but this is quite rare.If you have a new car, you want to look for technical service bulletins for your car models. In some car models, such as Chevrolet or GMC vehicles you will find bulletins about the issue."
Can a bad intake air temperature sensor cause misfire?	"It is possible for a bad intake air temperature sensor to cause a misfire. The engine?s computer uses the information from the intake air temperature sensor to determine how much fuel to inject into the engine. If the sensor is not providing accurate information, it could cause the engine to misfire."
Can I clean an IAT sensor?	"Yes. It is possible to clean an IAT sensor and it may fix the issue in many cases. The best way to clean an IAT sensor is to use a mass air flow cleaner or an electronic cleaner. Just spray a little on the sensor head and let it dry. Do not use a towel or similar to dry it, as this may damage the sensor."
Is the IAT sensor necessary?	"Yes. The IAT sensor measures the temperature of the air going into the engine. This information is used by the engine control unit (ECU) to adjust the fuel/air mixture. This helps ensure that the engine runs at optimal efficiency and prevents knocking or pinging.Without an IAT sensor, the ECU would have no way of knowing how cold the air entering the engine is. This could potentially lead to engine damage due to an inaccurate fuel/air mixture."
Is an IAT sensor the same as a MAF sensor?	"No. An IAT sensor is not the same as an MAF sensor and they serve different purposes. However, the IAT sensor and the MAF sensor are often integrated as the same part in modern vehicles. Although they are the same part, they have completely separate circuits so they should not be considered the same."
Conclusion	"The first thing you should do when you have problems with your car and suspect that the IAT sensor is bad is to read the error codes from the engine control module with a diagnostic scanner. In many cases, this will give you a clear picture of what is wrong with the car.If you suspect that your IAT sensor may be going bad, but you feel that you don?t have the knowledge to diagnose it properly, it?s important to get it checked out by a mechanic as soon as possible. It?s not good for your engine to drive around with a bad IAT sensor or performance issues."
What is Engine Sludge?	"Engine sludge is a black tarry substance that shows up in the motor. It occurs as a result of chemical reactions.  It is old motor oil that degrades naturally when it is exposed to high temperatures and oxygen.The higher the temperatures go, the quicker the degradation happens. For every 18 degrees the temperature rises, you can expect oxidation rates to double. The by-products of these chemical reactions include organic acids combined with polymeric products. Together, these products will continue to react until they create sludge.At first, the sludge might just be a thin film, but eventually, it starts to bake onto the surfaces to create a horrible mess."
What Are The Symptoms Of Engine Sludge?	"The most common symptom of engine sludge is a low oil pressure light on your dashboard or a noisy engine. Not only is engine sludge gross, but it can also cause some disastrous effects.As the sludge becomes thick, the oil can block passages, including the oil-pump pickup screen. This blockage leads to oil starvation. These problems happen over time, not suddenly.In addition, if the engine has variable valve timing, engine sludge can impact the needed mechanisms. Sludge will always decrease engine performance, reduce efficiency, and lead to costly repairs. "
How to Remove Engine Sludge ?	"1. Use Engine Additive Various companies make an engine additive meant to treat sludge. Park your vehicle on a level area and remove the engine oil cap.Pour a can of your selected treatment into the engine. Make sure you follow the instructions on the can.Put the engine oil cap back on and run your car for 10 to 15 minutes. You don?t want to drive the car with this treatment in the engine; you just want it to warm up completely.With this engine treatment, you can help liquefy the sludge inside the motor. It will mix better with the dirty oil so you can flush it. 2. Drain the OilOnce the engine has been warmed, you are ready to change the oil. Remove the drain plug from the oil pan and let it run into your drain pan. Some people swear that using an air compressor helps to remove the sludge from inside the engine. However, you want to do research before you choose this option, as it could introduce new contaminants into the engine.3. Install Oil FilterWith an oil filter wrench, you can take the filter off. More oil will drain from the system when you do this. With your new filter, put some clean oil on the gasket to create a solid seal. Using your hand, turn the filter clockwise to tighten it. 4. Add Fresh Motor OilOnce you have drained the oil from the system and put your new filter on, it?s time to reinstall the drain plug. Check the grade of oil you are using to ensure it is compatible with your system. You can find this information in the service manual. If you use the wrong motor oil, it can harm the engine and encourage more sludge buildup.Pour in new motor oil. Check the level with the dipstick and add more if needed. Just don?t overfill the system with oil. It should fall between the ADD and FULL lines.Screw the oil filler cap back on tightly. Take your car for a test drive and see if it runs better."
How To Prevent Engine Sludge ?	"With a little due diligence, you can prevent engine sludge from occurring in the first place. Here are a few steps to prevent engine sludge:1. Regular Oil ChangesThe best way to prevent engine sludge is to keep up with the oil changes. When you remove the dirty, contaminated oil, you ensure that sludge can?t build up.If you use conventional oil, you might need to change it every 3,000 miles. However, synthetic oils can go up to 10,000 miles without a change. Check your service manual for more guidance.2. Drive with CareThe way you drive can have a profound impact on the integrity of the oil. For example, if you do a lot of stop-and-go driving, you are subjecting the engine to a lot of wear. Additionally, if you use your pickup truck to haul and tow often, the engine is going to need more care. Consider changing the oil more frequently to avoid sludge.3. Visit Your MechanicThe best way to prevent engine sludge is to visit the mechanic often. If you do your own work, it?s important to keep an eye on the system and perform regular inspections. If you catch problems early, you can avoid expensive repairs later.For example, if the engine starts knocking or is smoking, these are warning signs. You should also be aware of poor fuel economy and a decrease in performance. "
what are the Symptoms Of Bad Piston Rings ?	"The most common symptoms of bad piston rings are high oil consumption, blue smoke coming from the exhaust pipe during acceleration, and you will probably feel a loss of power in your car.Because of the piston rings? vital role, there are some major symptoms you should look out for. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of bad or failing piston rings to look for:1. A Large Amount of Oil Disappears Bad Oil ConsumptionWhen the piston rings fail, they cannot keep the oil from leaking into the cylinder; as soon as the oil leaks, it will get mixed up in the combustion process.Slowly and gradually, all your engine oil will leak into the cylinder, and you will witness a drop in your car?s engine oil level. You would need to get an oil refill more frequently.If you were changing the oil every 5000 miles, you might feel your car needs oil by 3000 miles. If you witness such a phenomenon, you should not waste any time and book an appointment with your auto mechanic. A professional will diagnose the engine?s valve seals and piston rings and advise you to replace them if needed2. Oil leaksCar Oil LeakWhen the piston rings are bad, you will get high pressure inside the crankcase. This makes the engine sealings fail and start leaking oil. If you see many different oil leaks, you should absolutely check the pressure in the crankcase.You can do this by letting the engine stand on idle and carefully opening the oil cap. There should be no pressure at all, but a small vacuum. If the oil cap flies away together with a lot of smoke that pours out, you may have bad piston rings.3. Weak AccelerationSlow Acceleration CarWhen the piston rings get damaged, the engine?s combustion chamber loses pressure. This causes the engine to lose power, since the piston cannot completely compress the fuel and air mixture. As a result, the engine creates less power in each cycle.You could be slamming the throttle to its limit and still not feel your vehicle speed up the way it?s supposed to. Loss of acceleration may mean you need to get your piston rings replaced.Once you replace the old ones with the new ones, you will get higher compression, and you will feel an immediate change in your vehicle?s power.4. Blue Smoke Emitting from Exhaust Oil Smoke Car E1609805071325Not only will worn out piston rings cause a loss in performance, but they will also cause your car?s exhaust to emit blue smoke. When oil gets mixed up with the fuel-air mixture and burns, a thick blue cloud of smoke comes out of the exhaust. This is usually the first symptom you will notice, since it is almost immediate.You should consult a mechanic at the earliest opportunity if such a problem presents itself. The longer you ignore the problem, the more advanced it will become. Ultimately, other engine parts will get damaged, leading to a higher repair cost."
what is the Piston Rings Function ?	"The piston rings help keep the combustion chamber ? the area inside each cylinder ? pressurized, which makes it easy for combustion to happen. The piston rings are the seal between the piston and the cylinder walls which keep the combustion chamber?s pressure and oil in the crankcase. If they deteriorate or fail, your car?s engine will start losing power, and literally hundreds of other problems may arise if they are not dealt with quickly."
whare the Piston Rings Location ?	"The piston rings are located inside the engine block, inside the cylinder wrapped around the pistons.Therefore, they are impossible to see without taking the whole engine apart, so to diagnose these, you have to check them with a leak-down-tester or a compression tester."
what the Piston Rings Replacement Cost ?	"The cost to replace your piston rings is between $1000 and $5000, depending on the car model and labor costs. The piston rings cost $40 to $200 depending on how many cylinders your car has. The labor work is between $1000 and $4000.Piston rings are small, but they are expensive to replace. It basically depends on your car?s make and model, but on average, you could expect to pay from $40 to $200 just for the piston rings. That doesn?t sound like much but remember that the labor cost is significant.Since the piston rings are located deep in the engine, the mechanic has to disassemble the engine and reach in to remove the old piston rings and replace them with new ones. This whole process takes time and requires precision.Once the new piston rings have been put in place, the engine has to be reassembled and fitted back in its position. It will take your mechanic 16 hours or more to complete the job. A certified mechanic will probably do it faster and more likely in the correct way.To install the piston rings correctly, you have to measure the ring cap and fit them in the right order. You also have to check and measure the cylinder walls for wear before installing the new piston rings. You can expect a labor cost between $1000?4000 for a correct piston ring replacement, depending on the engine.If you know how to replace them yourself, you can do it pretty cheap, though. But be prepared for a big job in which you need a lot of knowledge.Additionally, you may need to replace other parts while taking the engine apart, and you may even have to redo the engine block."
how to make Piston Ring Testing ?	"Piston ring testing is an important process to ensure the proper functioning of an engine's piston rings. Here are the steps to perform piston ring testing:Remove the piston from the engine and clean it thoroughly with a suitable cleaning agent.Place the piston on a flat surface and insert the piston rings into the grooves on the piston.Use a feeler gauge to measure the gap between the piston ring and the piston groove.Compare the gap measurement with the manufacturer's specifications for the particular engine being worked on.If the gap measurement is outside the manufacturer's specifications, the piston rings may need to be replaced.Repeat this process for each piston ring on the piston.Once all piston rings have been checked and replaced if necessary, reassemble the engine with the new rings.Overall, it's important to ensure that the piston rings are properly installed and working correctly to prevent engine damage and to ensure that the engine performs optimally."
Can I replace piston rings without removing the engine?	"Although it is possible to change piston rings without removing the engine, there is no good reason to do so. To replace the piston rings, you will need to remove the cylinder head and oil pan, so it will most likely be quicker and easier to remove the engine completely. You also want to at least hone the cylinders before installing new piston rings, and for this process, you want a clean engine block."
How long do piston rings last?	"Engine piston rings are made to last the full lifetime of modern cars. There is no fixed service schedule for when they should be replaced, and in most cars you will never replace the piston rings during the life of the car. However, if you don?t maintain your car properly or if you are just unlucky, they can fail."
Can I drive a car with a bad piston ring?	"No. It is not recommended to drive a car with a bad piston ring. If your piston rings are bad, it can cause damage to the cylinder walls, which can result in you needing to replace the entire engine block if you don?t fix it."
How do piston rings get damaged?	"Piston rings can be damaged in a number of ways. The most common cause of damage is wear and tear. Over time, the rings can become worn down, scored, or cracked. This can happen from simple things, like too much heat or pressure, or if you do not maintain the engine properly. Other causes of piston ring damage include foreign objects getting into the engine (rocks, dirt, etc.)."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad EGR Temperature Sensor ?	"A bad EGR temperature sensor causes the Check Engine Light to come on. It also leads to engine noises, such as knocking or pinging. However, some people don?t know about the problem until the emissions test is failed, showing the system isn?t working as it should. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing EGR temperature sensor to look for:1. Check Engine LightCheck Engine LightWhen the engine computer notices a problem with any of the signals or sensors, the warning light is going to illuminate. If the EGR temperature sensor is going bad or malfunctioning, the system will try to get your attention by illuminating the Check Engine Light on the dashboard.However, a Check Engine Light alone isn?t going to tell you that the EGR temperature sensor is failing. You will need to scan the system with an OBDII code reader because many faults can cause the Check Engine Light to come on. If you aren?t sure what the trouble code means, it?s easy to look it up online. 2. Engine NoisesCar Engine NoiseNo one ever wants to hear engine noises, but this is one problem that is common with the bad EGR temperature sensor. In fact, a knock or pinging noise can often be heard before the Check Engine Light illuminates. As the EGR temperature sensor fails, issues are caused by the system?s flow. Any alteration to the flow can cause the temperature in the cylinders to rise, which is what creates the alarming sounds. The noise can also resemble something metallic that?s rattling inside the engine, showing there?s an issue with combustion. You should never ignore the signs of an engine knock or ping. It?s possible that the issue is greater than just a failing EGR temperature sensor. Because the issues can lead to engine failure, you want to get a quick diagnosis and repair what is defective. 3. Failed Emissions TestSmog CheckIf you go for an emissions test and the vehicle fails, it could be a sign of a failing EGR temperature sensor. In some cases, the Check Engine Light might not be on, so a failed test could be the first sign. A malfunctioning sensor can give off false readings or fail completely. If emissions tests are required in your area, you could violate regulations, leading to possible fines. Additionally, the emissions troubles can lead to more damage. The car might use more fuel during this time, and the extra fuel can lead to issues with the catalytic converter, which is expensive to replace. "
where the EGR Temperature Sensor Location ?	"The EGR temperature sensor is part of the exhaust system. It sits on the exhaust manifold. It?s either mounted right to the manifold or it can also be located by the EGR valve. It?s simple to take the old EGR temperature sensor off. You want to start by disconnecting the negative battery cable. From here, take off the electrical connector to the sensor. There should be a tab that you need to push down before you slide it off. To remove the sensor, you want to unscrew it with a compatible wrench or ratchet. "
what is the EGR Temperature Sensor function?	"The EGR temperature sensor stands for exhaust gas recirculation temperature sensor. It?s an electrical sensing probe responsible for monitoring the EGR gas temperatures. Its other purpose is to transmit the signal it receives back to the engine computer. The EGR temperature sensor is a critical part of the exhaust gas recirculation system. It works hand-in-hand with the EGR solenoid, effectively controlling the flow occurring in the EGR system. It measures the exhaust gas temperature between the intake and exhaust manifold. As the temperature in the system rises, the EGR temperature sensor sends off a signal to the engine computer. To reduce pressure, the computer will pump out more flow to reduce the temperature pressure in the system. "
what  is the EGR Temperature Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"A replacement EGR temperature sensor might cost between $200 and $300. The labor makes up $50 to $75, while the part is going to add $150 to $225. If you are able to replace the EGR temperature sensor on your own, you can save a lot of money.Don?t procrastinate replacing the EGR temperature sensor at the first sign of trouble. Not only are you allowing excessive consumption of fuel, but the catalytic converter is going to experience more damage until it is repaired. Considering the average catalytic converter replacement costs $900 to $2,500, you are preventing an expensive repair bill with this simple action. "
how to  Clean the EGR Temperature Sensor ?	"While you might need to replace the EGR temperature sensor, this shouldn?t be your first step. Instead, you should consider cleaning the sensor first. In many cases, the issues can be resolved with this simple action. Over time, carbon builds up on the sensor, causing it to send incorrect data back to the computer which leads the entire system to malfunction. Cleaning the EGR temperature sensor doesn?t take a lot of effort, and you don?t need any special chemicals. In fact, you should avoid using any chemicals on the electronics, because you can create more damage. Simply take a dry, clean cloth and wipe down the sensor. You might see the buildup removed, especially if it hasn?t ever been cleaned. Try the sensor again to see if it fixes the problem. If you are still noticing the same issues after cleaning the sensor, you will need to replace it."
what is the  Common Fluids To Leak From A Car ?	"The most common fluids leaking from a car are coolant and motor oil. In many cases, it may not be a leak at all you see, but water condensation dripping from the air conditioner. This is completely normal.Any fluid coming from your vehicle should be investigated more closely, but not all of them mean something is wrong. Let?s take an in-depth look at these seven common leaking car fluids.1. Antifreeze LeakCoolant Leaking E1609789888621Coolant or antifreeze is needed to regulate engine temperature. When the engine gets too hot, you might notice a puddle of coolant below the car.Interestingly, it is one of the most common car fluid leaks. It could also indicate that there is a defect with the cooling system. If you notice coolant below the car, you want to have it checked out.Typically, antifreeze is a bright color, making it difficult to miss. You will also know this by the smell because antifreeze has a distinct sweet odor. It would either be green, pink or orange. Make sure the pets stay away from it because it is highly toxic. Hopefully, the leaking antifreeze is only caused by a loose clamp or hose, but it could mean a broken water pump or other serious coolant system concern. 2. Motor Oil LeakLeaking OilAs you drive, it?s possible for some oil to seep out of the engine, especially if you?ve put a lot of miles on the motor. However, if you notice oil under the vehicle after it has been parked, you want to have it looked at. Driving with not enough oil or a lack of pressure can cause major engine damage.Motor oil color depends on when you last changed it. It could be amber or light yellow if you recently performed a tune-up or it could be black or darkish brown if the oil is old.Most of the time, oil leaks are caused by engine seals or gaskets that have gone bad. It could also be due to a defective oil pan or improperly installed oil filter. Either way, a professional should take a look. 3. Transmission Fluid LeakCar Oil LeakTransmission fluid is often mistaken for oil, but you should be able to tell the difference because of the red tint. However, old transmission fluid can appear brown instead.Just like with engine oil, these leaks are serious and should always be looked at. You might notice the puddle anywhere under the transmission or from the lines going to the cooling system. 4. Fuel LeakCar Fuel Leak E1609793222449It doesn?t matter whether you have a gas- or diesel-powered vehicle; leaks can occur. If you notice a leak near the rear of the vehicle, you must consider a defective fuel tank is the cause. With that said, fuel can also leak near the front of the car if a fuel injector is going bad or fuel line has broken. Both fuels are clear, but diesel might have a slight blue tint to it. The way to determine it is gasoline is by the smell. Gas has a distinct smell, even after sitting for some time. Fuel-related mechanical problems aren?t just annoying but also dangerous. You don?t want to drive a vehicle with this combustible fuel leaking. 5. Brake Fluid LeakCar Fluid LeakHydraulic brake fluid is used in every modern vehicle. Without the proper amount of fluid, the brakes can?t operate correctly. That?s why you need to have any leaks looked at immediately.Brake fluid appears yellow and oily or brown if it is older. The key component of this fluid is the slick feel. It will be very slippery. You can also check the reservoir to see if the levels are down. 6. Windshield Washer Fluid LeakWasher FluidSometimes the windshield washer reservoir succumbs to the heat from neighboring systems and cracks. When this happens, you might notice a leak under the car that is blue and has the consistency of water.Another clear sign is that the reservoir is empty even though you haven?t used the fluid. If the crack is bad enough, you will see it pouring out as you fill the container. 7. Water LeakWater Dripping Under CarOf all the fluids that might be leaking, water is the least concerning, especially if you have been running the air conditioner. Excess moisture causes condensation, which can drip from underneath your vehicle.However, if you start to notice an abundance of water dripping, it doesn?t hurt to have it looked at. "
Diagnose Common Car Fluid Leaks ?	"Diagnosing common car fluid leaks isn?t difficult if you are observant. Follow these steps to determine what is leaking.Place a piece of cardboard under the leaking area of the vehicle.Examine the color of the leaking fluid. Here is a basic cheat sheet of common fluid leaks.Green, Pink or Orange: AntifreezeAmber or Dark Brown/Black: Motor OilRed: Transmission FluidClear/Blue-tinted: FuelYellow: Brake FluidBlue: Windshield Washer FluidClear: WaterYou can also smell the fluid to see if it is recognizable. Several of the substances listed above have a unique smell. For example, antifreeze always smells sweet, while gasoline smells like a fuel pump. If your car is leaking oil, it could smell like burnt rubber. Additionally, transmission fluid also has a sweet smell, but it is tarter than coolant. Learning how to identify these common car fluid leaks is essential to maintaining a reliable ride. Some leaks can be discovered and repaired at home, but others require a professional. It never hurts to have your mechanic look at any leak you are experiencing. Remember, driving a vehicle with any major leak can lead to more disastrous consequences, whether it affects your on-road safety or leads to more expensive repairs down the road."
What Causes Lifter Tick? 	"The most common causes of lifter tick include contaminated oil or not enough of it. Additionally, you might have used the wrong oil grade or be facing a bad lifter. Finally, it?s possible that the pushrod is bent, which requires replacement to fix. Here is a more detailed list of the common causes of lifter tick:1. Contaminated OilEngine SludgeThe motor requires oil to ensure all of the components are properly lubricated. As it gets older, the lubrication breaks down, causing the engine to not run at its best.It?s important that you perform regular oil changes to combat this issue. Additionally, change the oil filter to ensure there?s no unnecessary contamination. 2. Not Enough Oil Engine Oil DipstickBecause the oil keeps the engine lubricated, there must be enough of it inside the motor to do its job. If the oil levels get too low and the engine can?t run at its best, the lifters may not function properly.Even if the engine isn?t making noise, you must resolve the low engine oil issue promptly. Allowing the engine to run with the wrong amount of oil can cause serious, irreversible damage.3. Wrong Oil TypeAll engines run on different oil types. The viscosity rating must be carefully paid attention to if you want to ensure proper operation. In colder climates, you want an oil that is less viscous, so it can flow faster. If the oil is too thick, the engine performance suffers when the temperatures dip too low. However, the summer months require oil that runs thicker. You should be able to determine what oil viscosity is appropriate by checking the vehicle owner?s manual.4. Bad LifterIf the problem isn?t related to the oil, then the lifter itself might be to blame. If the lifter is malfunctioning and not moving as it should, you are going to hear a ticking sound that can become progressively worse.The only repair for a bad lifter is to replace it. If you don?t take action soon enough, the problem might create a misfire, as the valve no longer opens as it should. 5. Bent Pushrod (Some engine types)The car?s age and the way it is driven can have a profound impact on how the pushrod operates. Over time or after a lot of abuse, it?s possible for the pushrod to bend.When this happens, the lifter can?t function correctly, leaving you with an engine tick. The only way to repair this issue is to replace the bent pushrod. "
How to Fix Lifter Tick ?	"The first thing you should do to fix the lifter tick noise is to check the engine oil level. You also want to make sure the oil condition is good and change the engine oil and filter if it?s old. You can also try using an oil additive.Here are some more detailed steps on how to fix the lifter tick:1. Check Engine OilThe maintenance of your car should be your top priority, which is why the engine oil and filter must be changed regularly. If you allow contaminated oil to run in the system, it could lead to a lifter tick. However, even when the system has clean oil, it might not have enough. Between oil changes, check the levels and top off when needed. Make sure you always use the right oil type for your car and the season. You might need to swap your usual oil during different months based on the climate in your area. 2. Use an AdditiveTo keep the oil at its best, you may also consider using an additive. There are many high-quality oil additives that will clean out the engine components and keep the system fully lubricated. Most engine oil additives benefit the valve lifters, pushrods, rocker arms and valves. With most formulations, you want to pour in the additive when you do an oil change. I recommend the Liqui Moly 20004 Hydraulic Lifter Additive. This is an affiliate link, and this means that at no cost to you, I may receive a small commission for qualifying purchases.3. Replace LifterThe worst-case scenario is that you need to replace a valve lifter. If it breaks, you have no option but to get a new one. At the same time, you might just replace them all because the bad lifter could have caused additional wear to the other ones. There are also times when the valve lifter can simply be adjusted to avoid ticking if you have an older engine with solid lifters. A professional shop will be able to tell if there?s an issue with the clearance between the pushrods, camshafts and valve lifters. 4. Replace Pushrod (Some engine types)If the pushrod has become damaged, it needs to be replaced. The same can be said about the rocker arm. However, neither of these fixes is inexpensive, which is why it?s important to maintain and care for your engine in the first place. Replacing engine components can be time-consuming and requires great expertise. "
What is a Lifter?	"The hydraulic valve lifter is found next to each valve. This cylinder is connected to the valve by the rocker arm, which is a small rod. The lifter?s job is to help open and close the valve with the assistance of the rocker arm.If there is a problem with the engine or the lifter, ticking noise can occur. The sooner the problem is resolved, the less likely you are to run into major repairs. Your engine can also have a hydraulic lifter installed directly between the camshaft and the engine valve, depending on the engine type."
How much does it cost to fix a lifter tick?	"If you simply need to perform an oil change to resolve the lifter tick, you might spend between $35 and $150. Doing your own oil change at home can help you save some money. However, if you need engine parts replaced, the bill is going to rise substantially.Working on the engine requires a lot of time, so you must factor in the cost of the labor. For example, you could easily spend $250 to $1,000 to have the valve lifters replaced. If you drive a luxury vehicle or a large truck, this cost could exceed $1,500 until all is said and done.Additionally, if you need to have a pushrod or rocker arm replaced, you could spend between $500 and $1,500. The total cost goes back to the type of vehicle you drive and the location where you take your vehicle for repair."
How serious is lifter tick?	"Lifter tick should be taken seriously as it is an internal engine part that is causing the noise. Any time there is a problem with an internal engine part you should take it seriously. If something goes wrong, it can destroy the whole engine."
Can lifter tick damage your engine?	"Yes. If you are unlucky and the lifter gets damaged, it can create serious internal engine damage. There is a big risk that if something goes wrong with the lifter, the valves can hit the pistons, which can cause a lot of damage."
Can the lifter tick be fixed?	Yes. Lifter tick can often be fixed by simply filling or changing the engine oil if it is old and contaminated. There are also some oil additives that can give the lifter a longer life. But sometimes the lifter is bad and needs to be replaced.
Will thicker oil stop lifter noise?	"Yes. Thicker oil can sometimes stop lifter noises in older engines. But usually, it can be enough to just replace the engine oil with the same type of oil. Some additives will also thicken the engine oil to prevent lifters."
How long can I drive a car with a lifter tick?	"You should not drive a car with lifter tick at all without checking what is causing the lifter tick. Failure of the lifter can cause serious damage to the internal engine parts, such as pistons or valves."
Conclusion	"You should not drive a car with lifter tick at all without checking what is causing the lifter tick. Failure of the lifter can cause serious damage to the internal engine parts, such as pistons or valves."
How Much Does A Car Engine Weigh?	"The average car engine weighs between 300 and 700 pounds (140 to 320 kg), with most large engines like V8s weighing between 400 and 700 pounds, and a smaller V6 engine weighing between 300 to 450 pounds on average. However, diesel motors can weigh more than 700 pounds. "
Factors Affecting Car Engine Weight ?	"1. SizeLift Car EngineThe size of the motor is going to be the biggest determinant of its weight. Automotive engines are classified by how many cylinders it has. In most passenger cars, you will find a four-cylinder engine beneath the hood. However, larger vehicles are going to be equipped with six- or eight-cylinder engines, many of which are arranged in a V-shape configuration. With each cylinder that?s added, more weight is tacked on as well. 2. MaterialAnother factor determining the weight is the material used for the construction. A cast iron engine is going to be heavier than a motor constructed from aluminum. An older engine might be made from cast iron, causing it to weigh more than what?s found in a newer model made from aluminum. That?s why some car models weigh less as they get newer. 3. DisplacementEngine displacement is also going to affect the weight. As an example, the GM 215 cubic inch engine weighs about 175 pounds less than the LS1 346 cubic inch engine because of the smaller displacement. The larger the cylinder holes are and the further the pistons need to travel, the more weight you can expect. Because of this reasoning, a large four-cylinder engine could weigh more than a compact six-cylinder motor. 4. Model YearThe model year of the engine also impacts weight. The newer the engine is, the more likely advancements have been made. In some cases, these advancements can lower the weight. However, new technology can also lead to a higher weight as additional equipment is needed. "
How Much Does a V8 Engine Weigh?	"The typical V8 engine weighs around 400 to 700 pounds (180 to 320 kg). In a large pickup or SUV, you will often find the heaviest V8 engines. However, not all V8 engines are large and heavy. In fact, both the Ford/Jaguar 3.9-liter V8 from the 1990s and the GM 215 V8 were considered smaller eight-cylinder engines that weigh less than most. "
How Much Does a V6 Engine Weigh?	"Most V6 engines will weigh between 300 to 450 pounds (140 to 200 kg), but the same factors are in play. The V6 engine looks similar to the V8 motor, but it contains two fewer cylinders, so you can expect the weight to be reduced overall.Displacement doesn?t always change the weight dramatically. An example of this can be seen with the Ford EcoBoost V6 engine. The 3.5-liter V6 motor weighs 449 pounds, compared to the 2.7-liter V6 which only goes down nine pounds even though it is smaller. "
How Much Does a 4-Cylinder Engine Weigh?	"The average weight of a 4 cylinder modern aluminum car engine is 200 to 350 pounds (90 to 160 kg), quite much lighter than a v6 or v8 engine. If it?s a cast-iron block, you can expect it to be slightly heavier than an aluminum engine."
How Much Does a Diesel Engine Weigh?	"The average weight of a diesel engine for a car is between 400 and 700 pounds (180 to 320 kg). This depends on the size of the diesel engine, but diesel engines are usually heavier than petrol engines.The design of a diesel engine naturally makes it heavier than a comparable gas motor. Diesel engines produce more torque than the gas-powered variant, so it needs to be built differently. This added durability leads to more weight.Fun fact: Diesel fuel weighs more than gas because of the larger molecules. It also atomizes differently because of the viscosity and density. One gallon of diesel fuel weighs 7.1 pounds, while a pound of gasoline only measures 6.3 pounds. "
Do Heavier Engines Last Longer?	"Engine size won?t tell you the durability of the motor. How it is used and the vehicle it is placed in will have more effect on longevity than size. Larger engines don?t work as hard as the smaller engine does, but they also contain heavier parts, so more fuel and power is needed. A heavier engine can wear out just as fast as a lighter engine. However, it can also be more expensive to repair. "
differneces between Engine Weight and Performance ?	"Years ago, it was safe to assume that the larger the engine was, the more power it put out. However, that is no longer the case. Large engines are typically used in high-performance vehicles for better speed and acceleration. However, these heavier engines also reduce braking performance because there is more weight that must be stopped. Bigger engines can also make it more difficult to change lanes and take turns. Additionally, lighter engines can be more efficient. With a lower weight, less fuel is needed to move the vehicle. That?s why it?s important to evaluate the performance and weight of an engine before deciding what?s best."
What is a PCM?	"PCM stands for powertrain control module. In one module, this technology combines both the TCM and ECM, which is why it is found in newer models. Prior to this technology, a TCM and ECM were needed to do the same job. A powertrain control module handles the emissions, transmission and charging systems of your vehicle. As a powertrain module, it is responsible for overseeing the driveline and engine as well. The PCM handles more operations than the ECM and TCM could alone. With the sensors in place and data being transferred, it makes quick adjustments to ensure optimal engine efficiency and performance. Over time, it also learns more about the operations to make it even more efficient. Some of the aspects that the PCM handles include:ABS braking Shifting RPMsAir/fuel ratioEmissionsVariable valve timingCharging rateIdle speedFuel injectionIgnition timingElectronic differential performanceOf course, this list could continue on because the PCM acts as the heart and brain of the modern vehicle. "
What is an ECM or ECU?	"ECM stands for engine control module, while ECU stands for engine control unit. While these two have a different name, the modules are essentially the same thing. These electronic modules control multiple systems of the vehicle, including the ABS, airbags, cruise control and air conditioning. However, the engine is what the module is mainly responsible for. It optimizes performance and ensures efficiency by controlling the ignition, fuel injection and airflow.With the help of various sensors, the ECM interprets data, determining what systems need to be adjusted. It chooses what response to follow up with to create optimal running conditions. The manufacturer programs it to work with a specific vehicle, so it cannot be swapped with a different ECU. The ECM works in conjunction with the air-fuel sensors, MAF sensors, oxygen sensors, crankshaft and camshaft position sensors, coolant temperature sensor, throttle position sensor and the EGR valve sensor to ensure everything is running as it should. At startup, the ECM will go through a complete systems check to guarantee proper performance. If something isn?t running correctly, it can also put the vehicle into limp mode until repairs are made. "
What is a TCM?	"TCM stands for transmission control module. It can also be called the TCU or transmission control unit, but TCU shouldn?t be used to describe this because it can also mean telematics control unit. The TCM permits the shifting of gears in automatic vehicles. The manual transmission car won?t contain a TCM because the driver handles shifting. Various sensors are used to transmit information to the TCM, allowing the transmission to change gears in an optimized fashion for better performance and fuel efficiency.Some of the sensors working with the TCM include the wheel speed sensors, turbine speed sensor, transmission fluid temperature sensors, vehicle speed sensor and the throttle position sensor. Additionally, the TCM is monitoring the rate of acceleration, road slope, vehicle speed and deceleration rate for optimized control. "
what are the Faulty Module Symptoms ?	"The PCM, ECM and TCM will all create symptoms when going bad, most of which are performance issues. 1. Engine Won?t StartWhen one of these vital modules goes bad, the engine might not start at all. When you go to start the engine, any faults can cause the system to shut down to protect it from further damage.Additionally, the engine might run with problems. If you notice misfiring, stuttering, a rough idle or stalling, it could be due to a faulty module. When this happens, you might also see warning lights on the dashboard. 2. Transmission Not Shifting SmoothlyWhen the modules go bad, they can affect the way the transmission works. You might notice rough shifting and inappropriate shifting times. There could also be some hesitation when you step on the gas pedal. When shifting problems occur, it is often related to the TCM on older vehicles and the PCM on modern models. 3. Poor Fuel EconomyFor optimal fuel efficiency, the engine and transmission must run as intended. Whenever some of the balance is off, the fuel efficiency can suffer.You might first notice trouble when you take the vehicle for emissions testing. However, if you are monitoring your fuel economy and you notice a decrease, you might find the problem early. "
Replacing a Defective Module	"The average cost to replace an ECM is often between $500 and $1000, while the average replacement cost for a TCM or PCM is similar. Using an OBDII scanner can help you pinpoint if one of the modules is faulty.Additionally, there are times when a simple reconfiguration or reprogramming by the dealer can be done to resolve the problem. If the update doesn?t resolve the situation, a replacement would be necessary.Aftermarket modules are available and help you save some money, but they don?t always work the way they should. The automaker didn?t make the aftermarket chips, so these might require specific software to work properly. Some automakers go further to discourage using aftermarket modules, such as creating a problem that can only be cleared with the right module. If you are driving a new vehicle, you can also void your powertrain warranty if you use something other than the OEM module.While you can replace the module yourself with some basic tools, you may not want to.

Minor blemishes and damage can be repaired through several different methods. We will discuss these methods in-depth later in the article. If you can have the bumper repaired, you are going to have a much lower cost than if it needs to be replaced.Bumper replacement will be recommended any time there?s severe damage. If the bumper has large holes or deep cracks in it, there might be no way to repair it. The biggest issue with repairing and replacing the bumper is to ensure that the paint color matches perfectly. "
what is the Factors Affecting Cost to Repair or Replace a Bumper ?	"1. Extent of DamageBumper DamageAs we just discussed, you are looking at a huge price difference based on whether a repair will work or you require a replacement. It?s the hope that a repair will be enough. Scuffs, minor scratches and small imperfections can usually be dealt with by choosing a repair method.On the other hand, bumper replacement is required if the damage is too severe to repair. You are going to pay a premium price to replace the bumper unless you get one from a junkyard and replace it yourself. 2. Vehicle Make/ModelYour vehicle type plays a huge role in how much you will spend. If you drive a popular car, it could be a lot easier for the shop to get a replacement bumper. Rare or sporty cars tend to have more expensive parts, as do luxury models. In addition, these luxury models can require a special technician, which further adds to the cost. Not only do you have to think about how difficult it is to get the bumper, but you also have to think about the amount of work required to ensure the paint matches. If the bumper doesn?t come already painted, this is another aspect that the auto body shop has to take care of. 3. Bumper Material/TechnologyThe bumper material changes how the collision center will work on it. Most automotive bumpers are made from some sort of plastic material, such as polypropylene (PP) or polyurethane (PUR). Back in the day, cars were made with aluminum or steel bumpers, which isn?t so popular anymore.Newer bumpers are filled with the latest technologies, making them even more expensive to replace. Today?s bumpers have lasers, sensors and cameras that must also be replaced or repaired when an accident occurs. Once the bumper is repaired or replaced, these technologies need to be recalibrated, which also adds to the cost. 4. DIY vs. ProfessionalWith enough expertise and the right equipment, you can repair or replace a bumper on your own. You will need a clean garage to work in, especially if you plan to paint. Working on your own car can keep the price much lower.On the other hand, not everyone should work on their bumper. It?s difficult to get the paint to match just right and you don?t want your vehicle to look less than normal, especially if you plan to sell it later. Evaluate how much you would save doing it yourself to determine if it?s worth having a vehicle that might not look as it would from the factory. If you choose to have it worked on professionally, shop around for the best price. Just don?t settle for the lowest-priced provider or you could be disappointed with the work you receive. Instead, research companies by the customer reviews and reputation. 5. Insurance CoverageDepending on what type of insurance coverage you have, you may be able to get the repair or replacement paid for. If the bumper damage was caused by an accident, insurance companies may pay for this repair. However, if you caused the accident, you will need collision coverage to handle the expenses.If bumper damage is caused because of vandalism, you will also need to have a special kind of coverage to pay for the repair. It?s best to contact your insurance company to figure out what is covered and what?s not.Even if your insurance pays for the repair or replacement, you will still be responsible for any deductible you agreed to. In some cases, this expense could be more than the repair itself. In this case, you wouldn?t want to file a claim, which could increase your future payments, when you can pay for the repair on your own. "
what is the Types of Bumper Repair ?	"1. Paintless Dent RepairPaintless Dent RepairThe newest and most common way of dealing with dented bumpers is with paintless dent removal. This repair method allows technicians to remove the dent without causing any further damage to the paint.Heat and some specialized tools are needed to pull the dent out. With a little finesse, the bumper can be restored to its natural state. This is one of the cheapest methods for fixing the automotive bumper, but it can only be done on minor dents. 2. Traditional Dent RepairIf a dent can?t be repaired with paintless dent removal tools, you have to go old school. Of course, there?s nothing wrong with using the traditional methods. The dent is pulled back out with specialized tools. However, the paint will be damaged in the process. Technicians will smooth and prime the area before repainting it. Not only does this method take more time, but it will also cost more. 3. Scuff/Scrape RepairIf the bumper has been scuffed or scraped, several tools will be needed, along with the help of some filler. Filler is used to restore the damaged area. Once the area has been filled, the technician will sand it down until everything is level. Once the fix is satisfactory, the paint will be applied to complete the look. Depending on how big of an area needs to be filled and painted, you could be looking at a high bill and several hours or days without your car.4. Crack RepairIf you have a small split, fracture or crack on the bumper, it may still be repairable. The key is making sure you have it taken care of right away. Again, the plastic filler will be used to fill the cracked area. Then, the surface will be sanded until it has become smooth. After all that is completed, the paint is ready to be applied. You will probably be facing a similar cost and repair time to the scuff and scrape repair. 5. Hole RepairIf you see a small puncture or hole in your bumper, you might think it can?t be repaired. In many cases, you may be right, but you shouldn?t procrastinate. If caught early enough, there?s a better chance for repair, which would save you money. These methods are going to follow the others we?ve already looked at. Technicians will fill the area and sand it smoothly to the surface. Once the hole is adequately repaired, paint can be applied. Otherwise, the hole might be too big to repair this way and you would need to have the bumper replaced."
Is It Worth Fixing A Cracked Bumper?	"Whether it?s worth fixing a cracked bumper depends on the model of car you drive. For some car models, a new bumper is quite cheap and in that case there is no reason to spend time repairing the bumper as it will cost more in the end if it is done by a professional. But if a new bumper for that particular car model is expensive, it might be worth it."

Although a scratch on the bumper will not affect the car?s performance or safety in most cases, it will affect its appearance. If you don?t want to drive around with a scratch on your bumper, it?s definitely worth fixing."
Conclusion	"There are many factors that you need to consider when deciding whether it is more worthwhile to repair or replace the bumper. If you are unsure about this, you may want to get some help from a professional.You can expect a bumper replacement to cost between $500 and $2,000, depending on the car model. You can expect a bumper repair cost of $100 to $800, so it can definitely be worth repairing the bumper in some cases.The bottom line is that whether you repair or replace your car?s bumper, the cost will be significant in many cases, so it?s important to get several estimates and talk to your insurance company before making a final decision."
How Much Does A Car Scratch Repair Cost?	"With so many different types of scratches that occur, it?s difficult to estimate a cost. For a small scuff or scratch, you may only spend $150 to get it repaired, while deep paint car scratches can easily tally up to $1,000 or more, especially if body parts need to be replaced or repainted. Now that we know the quick answer to car scratch repair, let?s take a look at the factors that affect car scratch repair costs."
what is the Factors Affecting Car Scratch Repair Cost ?	"1. Type of ScratchOne of the largest factors affecting the repair cost is the type of scratch that has occurred. If you are looking at a simple scuff or scratch in the clear coat, you probably won?t have a hefty bill. These are the most simple to repair and typically happen from either debris or rocks that are stirred up while driving. If the scratch reaches the primer of the vehicle, you are going to spend more. Thankfully, most of these don?t make it all the way to the metal, which is a blessing. Tree branches and car accidents can cause these types of scratches, requiring some sanding and painting to be repaired. The worst issues are the deep paint scratches. Because metal shines through these scratches, every paint layer needs to be repaired. You only deal with these types of scratches if you have been part of a massive collision or vandalism, so it?s not a common issue. 2. Make/Model of CarWhile the type of scratch is going to have the most profound effect on the cost, the type of car you drive also matters. Not all technicians are trained to work with every car make. This is especially the case if you are working with a German luxury brand or a high-end sports car. In these cases, you will need to pay more for a specialized auto body shop.Additionally, the parts needed for the vehicle could cost more on some models. It?s also difficult to match paint on a few rare models. If you drive a common vehicle, your chances of keeping the cost down are much higher. 3. DIY vs. ProfessionalIt?s possible to fix a lot of minor scratches on your own with some simple products. We will discuss these options in-depth in just a minute. If you can go this route, there?s a lot of money that can be saved. However, if you don?t know what you are doing, you could do more damage, so that?s something to consider.On the other hand, there?s always the option to visit a professional repair shop. If you find a local auto body shop, you should be able to spend a little less than at most dealerships. Still, you want to choose a reputable establishment to work on your vehicle, so you might consider spending a little extra. 4. LocationIf you go the professional route, you must also consider where you live. Auto body repair labor rates vary based on the region you live in.For example, getting work done in a busy metropolitan area could cost double the amount as it would in rural America. It might pay for you to travel a little bit to a remote location if you want to save a few dollars. "
Do It Yourself Car Scratch Repair Solutions	"If there?s just a small scratch on your paint, not deep enough to go to the metal, you can actually sometimes remove it yourself with a few basic tips. Here are some methods on how to remove car scratches yourself.1. ToothpasteToothpaste is one of the top home remedies for car scratch repair. You want to choose whitening toothpaste that?s slightly abrasive. It should operate similarly to fine sandpaper.With a small dollop on your microfiber cloth, you work the toothpaste into the scratch, moving in a circular motion. With a minor scratch in the clear coat, you should be able to smooth out the surface until it looks like new again. 2. WaxWax isn?t just for preventative measures. You can also use high-quality car wax to remove surface scratches. A good wax is going to fill the scratch with a protective layer that helps it disappear. It also prevents any future damage from occurring.3. PolishIf you are dealing with scuffs, swirl marks or oxidation, car polish can help. Make sure you invest in a high-quality polish for the best protection.Follow the instructions on the product you choose. When used right, you can remove minor blemishes and help the paint look perfectly sheened for a like-new appearance. 4. Paint Repair KitsYou can also find high-quality scratch repair kits on the market or through your auto parts store.

There is also the option to get a corrective paint pen if you need to fill in a larger scratch. If all else fails, visit your local dealership for an exact match. "
Does Car Insurance Cover Scratches?	"If your car has been scratched, you may want to see if your insurance will cover the repairs, so you can avoid paying more than necessary. Depending on your policy and the reason for the scratches, you may be in luck. If the scratch happened because of an accident or vandalism and your plan covers those incidents, you can have it paid for. However, you will still be responsible for the deductible, which could end up being more than the repairs if you are simply looking at a scuff. "
How To Prevent Car Paint Scratches ?	"1. Carefully Choose a Parking SpotThe place you park has a profound impact on the integrity of your car?s paint. If you park somewhere that sees a lot of pedestrians or sits close to other vehicles, you are putting the vehicle at risk for damage. You may consider parking in a nearby garage and walking instead. You can also scout out some quieter parking lots or park further back from a store where there isn?t as much traffic. It?s not just people and cars that can lead to damage. UV damage, bird droppings and tree debris also face threats to the paint. If you can?t park in a garage at home, consider investing in a soft-touch car cover. 2. Clean Car ProperlyBy taking the time to clean your car, you can keep the paint in its best condition. While cleaning the car is important, it?s also critical that you know how to keep it looking its best. During an at-home car wash, you could actually create more damage than good.If there is dirt and debris sitting on the car surface and you wipe it with a cloth, you can create scratches. To prevent this, you want to rinse down the entire surface before getting started. This is another reason why it?s important to avoid automated car washes because the sponges can transfer dirt and cause damage. 3. Drive SafelyBy remaining accident-free, you also prevent scratches from occurring. It?s often beneficial to take a defensive driving course and these don?t generally cost a lot of money.Obviously, you should also follow all traffic rules, such as abiding by speed limits. On top of that, stay alert to your surroundings to predict any mistakes that other drivers might be making while distracted. 4. Apply ProtectantThere are multiple protectant solutions that can be used after you wash your car. With a ceramic coating product, nano-coating is applied to protect the paint from corrosion, scratches and UV rays. While it does cost a little bit of money, the savings you receive from not having to repair the paint is priceless.You can have these products put on with your professional car wash. Otherwise, do some research and apply a high-quality protectant right at home."
How Much Does A Car Wrap Cost?	"You can expect a cost of $1,500 to $6,000 to wrap an entire car, depending on the type of car, type of wrap, and the garage doing the job. But the cost of a car wrap can vary greatly depending on which factors.As we?ve discussed, the majority of the cost is going to be tied up in labor, not materials. Because of this, the installer must factor in the complexity of the job, the type of decal you want, and how big your vehicle is before giving you an accurate quote. For a smaller coupe, it?s possible to get a simple car wrap installed for $2,000. However, if you drive a larger coupe or sports car, you might pay upwards of $3,000, while a compact truck, SUV or van could cost you $3,500.If you add special treatments, such as a carbon-fiber appearance or metallic colors, you need to prepare to pay more. Additionally, chrome treatments start at $6,000 and only get more expensive. If you want something completely custom or you are going for the exotic look, be prepared to spend up to $10,000 until all is said and done. You may also be without your vehicle for a few days while the job is done. Some models have bumpers that are difficult to remove. Plus, there are some areas of a car that can be difficult to wrap, such as the doorjamb. When you take your vehicle to get a car wrap, ask for an estimate on the cost and the time you will be without a ride."
what are the Car Wrap Cost Factors ?	"There are a few factors that you need to consider before finding the right car wrap cost for your car model. Here are 4 common factors you need to look at.1. Car TypeSmall Big CarThe majority of the cost you incur when getting a vehicle wrap is for labor. The process can be quite a labor-intensive undertaking, especially on a larger vehicle. If it is done right, the installation won?t be rushed. This is why the installer will base the cost on how large the vehicle is. Compact cars and coupes are generally the least expensive to wrap. From here, the family sedan or compact crossover will be the next least expensive. Wrapping a full-size SUV, luxury sports car or truck is probably going to cost you the most.However, the car type is looked at not just by size but also the design of the exterior. For example, if you are driving a Tesla, you might find the price is lower, simply because of the smooth car surface.2. Colors or OptionsWrapping CarYour vehicle wrap contains multiple vinyl decals that get applied around your car, on every panel, the hood, fenders, roof and doors. The wrap needs to cover every part of the body, leaving none of the original paint colors to shine through below. Plus, vinyl wraps are completely customizable, with chrome finishes, glossy options and metallic colors. Wraps are all created with the help of a computer, offering never-ending possibilities.With that said, there are a lot of options and colors that can add to your price very quickly. If you want a generic color applied, your cost will likely be much less than the driver searching for a custom look. 3. Car ConditionYour vehicle should be in pristine condition to have a wrap installed. If there are dents, dings or scratches, they need to be repaired first. This extra step adds more money to the car wrap installation.Just as you wouldn?t paint your vehicle with imperfections, you aren?t going to wrap your car with them either. Otherwise, all of these blemishes will shine through and your money will be wasted. A knowledgeable installer is going to properly wash and detail your car first. They will also fix any imperfections. 4. Wrap Application ProcessAfter the repairs are made and the car is detailed, the application begins. For a high-quality installation, you want to have all of the bumper covers, taillights and headlight assemblies removed. While the installer could put them on without taking this step, you will notice a better application because of this diligence.It will also help the decals adhere better, but is going to cost you more money in the end. You have to ask yourself whether you want to pay more for a shop that takes the extra time and does it right or if you would rather have a cheap wrap put on that might not last."
Is Wrapping a Car Cheaper Than Painting a Car?	"Yes, it?s usually slightly cheaper to wrap a car instead of painting it, but the difference isn?t huge. You can expect the average car wrap to cost $1,500 to $2,500, while a car paint can cost $2,000 to $3,000. However, this depends a lot on the type of car wrap and paint."
How Long Does a Wrap Last on a Car?	"A car wrap usually lasts around 6 to 8 years on average in a normal climate. However, this depends a lot on the quality of the car wrap and how well the job is done. The weather can also have a big impact. Wraps usually don?t hold up as well in hot weather because the heat can cause them to bubble and peel. They also don?t last as long when it?s freezing temperatures because it can damage the adhesive on the wrap."
Do Wraps Damage The Paint?	"A car wrap usually won?t damage the paint if it is applied and removed correctly by a professional. The risk is that if you are not careful when removing the wrap, you can rip off the original paint due to the strong adhesive. However, if it?s done by a professional, this should not be a problem."
How Do You Wash Car Wraps?	"When you have a wrapped car, it is recommended to only hand wash your car and also use products recommended for wrapped paint. However, modern wraps are quite tough, so in most cases you can just use regular mild car shampoo. Be careful with high-pressure automatic car washes, though."

How Much Does it Cost to Powder Coat wheels and rims?	"On average, you will spend $75 to $125 per rim to have it powder coated. The cost depends on what size the wheels are, what type of powder coating you choose, and whether you have it professionally applied or do it yourself. There are varying types of powder coating, which can easily affect how high the price goes. However, if you have extra money, it?s always best to choose a better powder coating material than a cheaper one, especially if you want it to last. "
What is Powder Coating?	"Powder coating refers to the dry coating that is applied to a specific surface. It?s applied to the surface electrostatically. Then, its heat cured to finish. This powdered material is made with a polymer base, infused with a curative mixture, along with pigments, leveling agents and modifiers. Powder coating is a more durable option than standard paint, as it will resist flaking and chipping. The reason it lasts longer is because the powder coating bonds better to metallic surfaces, making it an ideal choice for wheels. With today?s options, you can choose a powder coating in almost any hue you can dream of. For this reason, it?s also simple to customize your vehicle just the way you want it. "
Reasons Powder Coated Wheels are Expensive ?	"1. Hard to Work WithIt?s not easy to work with car rims, especially if they are large in size. Rims can be bulky and they aren?t easy to move around. If you are working with rims larger than 18 inches, you will need special hooks to hang them on. You might also need someone to help you move them around. 2. Long PreparationThere?s a lot of preparation that must occur when you powder coat the wheels if you want them to last. With the extensive preparation steps that must be taken, you are looking at higher labor charges.To prepare the wheels, the metal must be dealt with based on what material it is. Steel is treated differently than aluminum, ensuring that the powder coating sticks to the surface. Additionally, all of the parts that aren?t metal must be removed before the powder coating is applied. Otherwise, you will be dealing with residue that?s difficult to get off. Next, the wheels must be sandblasted. Depending on what kind of metal you are working with, the wheels must also need to be heated overnight to prepare them. Primer is also important, which can cost a good amount of money if you choose a high-quality formulation. If you don?t use a good primer, the metal underneath could easily corrode. 3. Better MaterialsAs with any auto body job, there are varying levels of material quality you can choose from. If you want the job to last, you need to pay more for the better materials. Sure, you can find a shop that is going to charge a rock-bottom price on the powder coating, but how often will you need to have them refinished?If you buy cheap powder coating, the material could begin chipping within a couple of days, making the job a waste. Save yourself the trouble and invest upfront. Make sure you also splurge on a protective top layer that also helps to prevent damage. Another factor has to do with the color. If you are looking for a simple black powder coating, you might not spend as much as someone hoping for a unique color. The more work that goes into preparing the color and material, the more you can expect to pay in the end. 4. Qualified TechnicianNot everyone is qualified to apply powder coating to a set of wheels. Even if your cousin?s best friend says he can do it, it?s best to choose a professional to handle the task. If the job isn?t done properly, a serious scratch or damage is sure to follow. As you search where to take your vehicle, get multiple quotes, but don?t choose who you want to work with based on the price alone. Instead, have a look at some of the other work that the shop has performed and ask for a list of qualifications. It?s worth paying more to get a shop that?s experienced and has a long history of customer satisfaction. "
differences between DIY and Professional Wheel Powder Coating ?	"If you think you are qualified to handle powder coating your own wheels, you could save a lot of money. However, there are some things to consider. First, you will need some specialized tools. If the wheels need to be baked in an oven, you will need one capable of handling this task. A regular oven should never be used, because you don?t want to accidentally ingest the powder with your food. For this reason, supplies to get started could easily cost $5,000 or more. While taking the vehicle to a professional is going to cost more for the job itself, it?s often worth the savings over the equipment you would need. However, if you have access to the tools already, you could easily complete the job on your own. "
Maintaining Powder Coated Rims 	"If you want the powder coated wheels to last as long as possible, it?s critical to maintain them. While maintaining these rims will take a little more time than normal, it?s not a complicated procedure. Here are some tips to get you started. Clean the Wheels: It?s important that the wheels remain clean and dry. Don?t use harsh chemicals, and make sure any debris is removed as soon as possible. Mild soap and water are good for everyday cleaning, while a special wheel cleaner might be useful on occasion. Protect with Sealant: You want to apply a special coating or sealant to the rims. Choose a product that repels brake dust, as this can eat away at the powder coating over time. Not only will this protectant keep the finish from chipping, but it also makes the surface easier to clean.Park in Shade: Sunlight is the enemy of powder coating, leading to fading over time. If you can park in a garage, this is your best option. Otherwise, consider investing in a car cover to protect not only the wheels, but the body paint as well. If you make time to regularly maintain the wheels, you will spend a lot less money overall. Instead of needing to have the wheels refinished, you can keep up the care for just a few dollars each time."
Should I Get a White or Black Car?	"White cars are fashionable, easy to clean, simple to sell, provide good visibility, and keep the temperature cool. However, white cars don?t hide dirt well, show rust, and there?s an abundance of them. Black cars are elegant and hide rust, but they get hot, are harder to clean, and attract birds.While this is just a quick answer, there is much more to it. Now, I?ll look at the pros and cons of both white and black cars, so that you can make your decision."
Pros of a White Car	"1. FashionableWhite cars continue to be one of the most popular car colors, with many automakers offering the color as a free option. It?s universal and looks good in any setting.Blending in can be a good thing, especially if you don?t want to excite the senses of cops as you drive by. If you are looking for the most practical option, you can?t go wrong with white. 2. Easy to CleanWhite is one of the easiest car colors to clean. You won?t see smudges and water spots as easily, making washing and waxing an easier job.If there are scratches on the paint, they are also harder to see. Even if you do need to add some paint for a touch-up, you will probably pay less for it than a comparable black hue. This is also one of the reasons why you often see car manufacturers at car shows using white cars because it is difficult to see small imperfections.3. Easy to SellBecause white cars are so popular, you won?t have any trouble selling them, either. Everyone wants white cars, so you will have a long list of potential buyers.If you don?t want to search for the right buyer, white is a great option. Plus, you won?t have trouble getting a dealership to take it off of your hands. 4. Lower TemperatureIf you have ever been to a really hot country, you probably saw that the majority of the cars are often white. White colors reflect sunlight, leaving the inside of the car cooler than other options. There?s nothing cooler than a white car in the summer, ensuring you don?t have to overwork the air conditioning system. If you live in a hot, humid area, you will appreciate any help you can get. However, it might not matter as much to you if you live in the north. White paint is also preferable in hot countries, because the paint will not burn as easily from the sun.5. VisibleIt?s easier to see a white car than it is a black one. If you spend a lot of time driving in low-light situations, you will want this added protection.However, the right exterior lighting can ensure any color car can be adequately seen. The only time a white car becomes difficult to see is in heavy snow. "
Cons of a White Car	"1. Doesn?t Hide DirtYou won?t have trouble hiding the dust on a white car, but dirt and mud are very noticeable. You may need to visit the car wash more often. Thankfully, it?s easy to get clean. The only downside is you really can?t tell the car is clean once it?s done. You don?t get the same shocking appeal after a car wash that comes with a black car.Especially if you live in a cold country with snow where they put salt on the road, the white paint color will look yellow or orange and it will be difficult to keep it clean! So you need to consider the conditions in your country first!2. Overabundance on RoadAs you head down the road, you can quickly become immersed in a long list of other white cars. It can be difficult to stand out at all.This might not seem like a problem until you are trying to find your car in a crowded parking lot. You have to be careful you don?t choose the wrong white car. 3. Easy to See RustAs any car ages, rust becomes visible. With a white car, the rust becomes more visible than with many other colors. White paint isn?t as forgiving with rust. If it begins rusting, you will want to repair it, especially before you try to sell it. "
Pros of a Black Car	"1. ElegantThere?s no other color as elegant as the black car. That?s why many luxury cars drive down the street with a black finish. Black cars also look powerful and more aggressive. When the car is clean, nothing else can compare. Black cars are also one of the car colors that hold the resale value best, probably due to the elegance of a black car, along with its popularity.2. Hides RustThere may not be a lot you can hide on a black car, but rust can?t be seen. When a black car starts to corrode, it?s very difficult to notice.Additionally, you should be able to easily match the black paint if you want to touch up damaged spots. There?s much more leeway when working with black paint than many others. "
Cons of a Black Car 	"1. Hard to CleanThe black car looks amazing when it is clean. However, it?s difficult to get it to look its best, and it never lasts for long.One of the biggest disadvantages of black cars is that you will see every water spot after the wash, requiring that you dry it appropriately. You will also need to use high-quality polish and wax because scratches and swirl marks on the car paint from car washes are very easy to see. Dents are also, unfortunately, very visible on a black car.2. Prone to Bird DroppingsBlack cars love to collect dirt. However, that?s not all that likes to build up on darker cars. For some reason, black cars also attract birds. Where there are birds, there is also a ton of white poop stains. These don?t just look horrible, but they mean you must clean the car again ? otherwise, the car paint can get damaged.3. Gets HotUnlike the white car, black colors retain heat. After a couple of minutes of sitting in the sunlight, the interior of the car is going to be very hot.You will have to push the air conditioner to work harder. Additionally, the car can be downright miserable until it gets cooled down. In hot countries, the black paint can also get damaged by the sun due to the heat."
Black and White Car: Which is Better?	"So, which of these is the best car color? If you are trying to decide between a black vs. white car, you have a lot of factors to consider. Both white and black are at the top of the most popular colors. Not only do you need to think about the look you are going for, but it?s important to consider your climate, as well.If you want a practical, easy to clean, and cool vehicle, go with something white. However, if you want something elegant and don?t mind spending more time on maintenance, then black is a better option."

Are you looking for a small fix before you sell the car or do you need to restore a classic?

In the end, you might not end up with the results you were hoping for, leading you to need a professional paint job anyway. In many cases, it makes more sense to have a professional paint job performed, especially if you want the vehicle to be restored to its original condition. While it might cost more, the paint is going to last longer and typically match better. "
Cost to Paint a Car Professionally ?	"1. Basic Paint JobAs the least expensive paint job, you will spend less on the basic service. With this painting service, you can expect the body shop to use a minimal amount of coats.Plus, synthetic enamel-based paint will likely be used. The only areas being painted are the ones that are visible, so you can expect that inside the hood and other unseen areas will go untouched. In total, expect to spend between $300 and $1,000. 2. Standard Paint JobThe standard paint job is going to go beyond basic and perform some repairs. Before painting begins, the auto body shop will sand down the surface and remove any rust.These steps help to ensure that the finish is perfect and lasts longer. Expect to pay anywhere from $750 to $4,000 on this level of painting. 3. High-Quality (Showroom) Paint JobIf you are creating a show car or restoring a classic, you want a high-quality paint job.

How Much Does It Cost To Paint A Car Yourself?	"You can expect it to cost between $100 and $500 for the supplies to paint a car yourself. However, this depends on what you are going to paint, and the quality of the products you choose.

You can gather the majority of the supplies for $300 or less, especially if you already have a paint sprayer on hand. However, this DIY painting task will require a good amount of time. Some of the materials you may already have on hand. Gather these supplies to get started:Foam brushesGloss paintPaint traysPrimerAutomotive masking tapeMineral spiritsSandpaperAutomotive paint sprayerThe biggest challenge will be finding the spot to paint your car. It?s unlikely you have a booth that?s climate-controlled as the body shop does.

Car Paint Cost Factors 	"1. QualityAs discussed above, the cost is going to be dramatically affected based on the level of quality you are looking for. If you simply want a fresh coat of paint, you could spend a minimal amount.However, if you need a paint job that provides a showroom quality appeal, the cost is going to be much higher. Expect to spend several thousands of dollars on a high-quality paint job. 2. Size of VehicleIf you drive your compact car into the auto body shop, your cost is going to be far less than a large SUV. While the same paint job is being applied, there is more surface area to cover.The body shop figures out how much area will be painted and charges you accordingly. Not only will more supplies and paint be needed, but the technicians will need to spend more time on the vehicle. 3. ColorAny standard color, such as white, gray or black, is going to be cheaper than a custom color. Additionally, if the color is easily accessible because it?s used on popular models, it will be cheaper.You can expect to spend more if you need to get a custom color from a premium automaker. Even worse, if the color needs to be created, you will need to visit a top-notch body shop, thereby adding more to the price. 4. RepairIf there are no repairs needed, the paint job is straightforward and costs less. However, if you have deep scratches or imperfections to the paint, you will be spending more. There are some auto body shops that won?t paint the vehicle unless it is repaired first. This is a good business practice since paint doesn?t adhere as well without a smooth surface. 5. FinishWhat happens after the paint is applied also affects the price. If the auto body shop finishes the job with a wash and wax, you aren?t going to spend much more.On the other hand, if you opt for a ceramic coat or another type of specialized finish, the price will jump dramatically. These extra coats can be expensive, but the value is worth the cost, especially if you want the paint to last."

How Much Does It Cost To Paint A Car A Different Color?	"There is usually no difference in price if you want to paint a car in a different color or the same color, unless you want to change from solid color to a metallic color.

Anyone can paint a car cheaply, but the result will most likely not be very good.Due to the fact that the paint is very visible on a car, we would recommend spending some money on a good car painter if you want a good result. You should also consider wrapping the car instead of repainting it."
Which is better: Car Wrap or Paint?	"There?s no real right or wrong answer to if wrap or paint is the better choice for everyone. A paint job will leave you with a much better result, while if you need to change a car?s color fast and don?t want to spend a lot of money, a car wrap is a good option.There are a lot of advantages and disadvantages to either option.

Why Would You Upgrade MY Vehicle?	"You must be considering upgrading the appearance of your vehicle if you?ve come to this decision.

If you can?t afford to buy a new car, upgrading the appearance is a great option.There?s also the chance that you want to get creative with your vehicle. Instead of being the same color as everyone else?s, you might want to do something unique. Additionally, changing the exterior of your vehicle is a great way to get attention for your business or project. Now the only thing left to do is decide between the vinyl wrap and a new paint job."
What is a Vinyl Wrap?	"Vinyl wraps have been around for several decades, but they were too expensive for the common person to use. However, recent manufacturing processes have made them more affordable, allowing anyone to get a wrap on their car.This auto body upgrade has become quite popular in the United States and other parts of the world. With a vinyl wrap, you can add a unique style and protect the paint on your vehicle without changing its color. Instead, a thin sheet of vinyl material is applied over your vehicle?s paint and secured in place with a special adhesive. Vinyl comes in 60-inch-wide rolls, measuring 25-feet long. This is typically what would be needed to wrap your entire vehicle. You will pay about $2,500 for this size vinyl wrap, plus the installation and design. "
Automotive Vinyl Wrap Pros 	"There are several reasons to consider a vinyl wrap, including:1. Durability The laminated vinyl wrap doesn?t get easily damaged by UV rays as paint does. Because of this design, the wrap will not fade over time.Plus, the thick material ensures that your vehicle is protected from scratching and chipping. You won?t need to wax your vinyl wrap as you do with paint. Instead, just use soap and water to keep it clean.2. Reasonable PricingSometimes, having the car wrapped can be cheaper than getting a new paint job. This is especially true if you plan to change the graphics often, such as with a race car.If you are working with a tight budget or you only want a small section covered, the vinyl wrap might prove to be a better option. 3. Shorter Installation TimeIt will take a few days or less to install the vinyl wrap, whereas the paint job can take weeks to complete. The longest part about getting a vinyl wrap is deciding on the design, which doesn?t require you to give up your vehicle.If you want to drop off your vehicle and get it back sooner, the vinyl wrap is a better option. 4. Flexibility With a vinyl wrap, there are no limits to what you can create. Choose a one-color design or use the entire rainbow. Plus, you can change your mind anytime you want and do a completely different style.If you decide later to start advertising your business, it would be simple to add another vinyl wrap to a portion of your vehicle. "
What is Automotive Painting?	"Whether you need to change the color of your vehicle or you are simply in need of some auto body touch-up, you?ve probably heard of automotive painting. This process is a little more complicated than the vinyl wrap, requiring the shop to strip down the car to its bare metal. Any chips or dents will also need to be repaired with body filler. Then, primer is applied to the car and left to dry before painting actually occurs. Sanding also has to happen in order to remove imperfections during the painting process. However, a car can drive away looking like it just came from the factory once the entire process is complete."
Automotive Paint Pros	"While there?s a place for vinyl wraps, automotive paint jobs have several benefits too.1. Repairs ImperfectionsThe vinyl wrap is a great option if your paint is already in great condition. Otherwise, it might not apply well, especially if there are dents, corrosion or scratches. In this case, the car will need a paint job for proper vinyl adhesion. At that point, it might make sense to just stick with the new paint application.If you attempt to install a vinyl wrap on a car with deep imperfections, you will end up with a shoddy graphic. Those imperfections will be seen through the wrap. Plus, when you attempt to remove the graphic from damaged paint, it can lead to further issues.2. Better Color MatchingIf you desire a perfect color match between the trunk, bumpers and doors, you want a factory-quality paint job. Only automotive body shops will be able to perfectly match the color of your car for a seamless appearance.This is especially important if you own a classic car or you plan to show off at car shows. 3. Ideal for Automotive EnthusiastsIf you are a do-it-yourself enthusiast, you might prefer the satisfaction of painting your car. It?s like building a shelving unit versus putting one together from a kit. That?s the difference between painting the car yourself or applying a wrap.If you take pride in your work, you probably won?t be happy putting a vinyl wrap on the vehicle. Instead, go through the process of taking it down to bare metal and starting with a fresh canvas.4. Fixes Small Sections If you want to improve the aesthetic of a smaller area on the car, a vinyl wrap might not fit your needs. With automotive paint, you can touch up small areas that have blemishes.It wouldn?t cost you much to fix a small area with a dent. Plus, some auto body shops have advanced technology that makes it easier to repair smaller areas, sometimes with no paint at all. "
How Much Does It Cost to Repair a Car Dent?	"For a small dent, you might pay $50 to $95 to have it removed. The larger the dent is and the more work that must be performed will both cause the price to go higher. In severe cases, you could spend $300 to $1,500 or more. However, several factors play into how high the repair cost becomes. 1. Minor DentsMinor DentIf there is a dent the size of a quarter or less on the car, you are going to spend the least amount of money. This dent could have occurred from hail or another impact, but it shouldn?t require a lot of labor.Most technicians can repair the smaller dent with PDR as long as they have the right equipment. At most body shops, this dent is going to cost $50 to $95 to repair.2. Moderate DentsSmall Car DentThe moderate dent will measure «-inch to 2-inches big. These can also be caused by hail in a more severe storm. They are also caused by golf balls and other objects.Sadly, a lot of these might not be repairable with PDR. If that?s the case, expect to spend $500 to $2,000 for each dent, depending on the location and type of paint required. 3. Severe DentsCar DentIf a big object has hit the vehicle, you might be looking at expensive repairs. Baseballs and shopping carts can leave deep dents that require a lot of manual labor to remove.Depending on the part affected, it might be best to replace it. For example, you would be better off replacing many bumpers instead of trying to repair them. On the other hand, repairing a dent in a body line could cost several thousands of dollars. "
what are the Factors Affecting Car Dent Removal & Repair Cost ?	"1. Dent SizeLarge Car DentThe larger the dent is, the more it will cost to fix. The main reason comes down to the way it needs to be repaired.On average, you can expect to spend about $50 to $95 for a smaller dent. It goes up substantially if the dents are larger and need more comprehensive repair.2. Number of DentsThis seems like an obvious factor, but many people don?t consider the effect it has on the price. If you have one dent that needs to be fixed, you can spend less than $100 if it is small.However, the price jumps up accordingly if there is more than one dent. That?s why hail damage can get so expensive to repair. 3. Method of RepairIf you have a small dent, the body shop might be able to use Paintless Dent Repair (PDR). This low-cost method doesn?t require sanding the body, re-painting or drying, making it inexpensive and fast. Instead, the body is reshaped back to its original beauty. If the dent is too large, PDR won?t be an option. For this repair, the area must be sanded, painted and dried, so a qualified technician is needed. You could easily spend $2,000 if the dents are large. In some cases, it might be best to replace the panel entirely. You can even get a new bumper for many cars without spending more than $500 to $750. 3. Dent LocationIf the dent is located on a body line, it?s going to be much more complicated to fix. Ideally, you hope that the dent is found on a flat surface, which is much easier to fix. Additionally, if the damage is too bad, it might not be repairable. In some areas, it?s best to replace the part completely to make it look its best.4. Car TypeEven with the smallest dent, some cars can be quite expensive to fix. For starters, the paint needed could be a specialty kind that causes the price to rise significantly. Additionally, the car?s construction could increase the price as well. If it?s made from steel or aluminum, you could be looking at a higher cost. 5. Repair Shop TypeYou could easily save some money on the dent repair by visiting a smaller, less-known body shop. These technicians might not have a lot of experience, so you get what you pay for.However, it?s often better to go with a reputable body shop, especially if you hope to avoid overspray, color mismatching, sagging paint and other imperfections. With that said, if you are driving an older car with other body issues, it could make sense to go with the cheaper option just to get the blemish looking better. "
how to make At-Home Car Dent Repair Methods ?	"1. PlungerCar Dent Repair PlungerIf you are only dealing with a small dent, you might be able to remove it at home with a special plunger. Don?t use your toilet plunger, but purchase one specifically designed for this auto body task. It can remove dents in almost any spot on the car.To use the plunger, put some water on the affected area and the plunger surface. Gently push and pull the plunger until you are able to remove the dent. If done correctly, the car body should look like new without causing any more damage. 2. Boiling WaterYou don?t need any special tools with this handy method. You can boil some water in your teapot or electric kettle to remove small dents in the car body. Just make sure you are safe or you could get burned.Carefully pour some of the boiling water onto the dented surface. Before the surface is able to cool down, you want to pop it out from the other side. This task can be difficult if you can?t easily access the other side. However, it almost always works on dents that aren?t too large. 3. Dry IceYou may also be able to get the dent worked out with the help of dry ice. The dry ice can help the body contract back into place. Just make sure you take precautions to keep the dry ice from your exposed skin or it can cause serious injuries. Hold the dry ice on the dent. You might need to rub it around slightly until that dent decides to pop back into its original shape. 4. Compressed Air/HairdryerIf you are having trouble with the other methods, you want to give the compressed air and hairdryer method a try. Turn on the hairdryer to its hottest setting. Heat up the dent to make it more malleable. Once you have the surface hot, it will have expanded. You can now spray the can of compressed air onto the dent. The cold air coming out of the can will cause the surface to contract so the dent can be retracted.  Just be careful so you won?t burn the paint.If it?s a larger dent, you want to get help from a professional though."
How to Prevent Your Car From Rust ?	"The best way to protect and prevent your car from rusting is to wash the car at least once a month. You can also apply wax to the paint and add extra rust protection to the underbody.Here?s a more detailed list of how to protect your car from rust during winter:1. Regular Car WashesCar WashSnow in winter covers all roads and paths and makes it difficult for you to drive your vehicle. The city authorities use salt to melt the ice and clear the road.Using salt is good for the road, but it is terrible for vehicles. If you drive on salted roads, the salt will stick to your vehicle everywhere and increase the risk of corrosion and rust.To prevent this from happening too much, it is a good idea to have your vehicle washed regularly.Try to wash your car at least 1-2 times per month during the winter to keep the rust and salt away. You often have to use special products to get rid of all the rust and salt in the paint job.I never recommend going to automatic car washes, because they are often damage the paint. However, I also understand that many people do not have their own garage to wash their car.You can often find car washing companies that wash your car manually. I strongly recommend this.2. Apply Wax to the Paint JobWax CarYou want to prevent dirt and salt from accumulating on the body of your vehicle. This can be easily prevented by applying an extra layer of wax to the paintwork after your car washes.The wax does not allow dirt to stick to the car and prevents the formation of rust. The areas where the car is most exposed, such as the chassis and the area near the wheels, require special care in winter. Don?t forget to get your car in shape just before the onset of winter.3. Rust ProtectionUndercoating CarToday, there are many rust protection products on the market that can be applied to your car?s chassis. The underbody is most exposed to salt, water, and snow and is, therefore, most susceptible to rust damage. A single layer of rust protection can extend the life of your car.You can either do this yourself or let an auto body shop do this for you. Doing it yourself can be quite time-consuming if you do not have the right tools for it.Many newer cars have a lot of plastic covers under the car that protect them for this. However, dirt can still get stuck under these covers, causing rust, so it is recommended to remove these plastic covers to check for rust every once in a while.4. Clean the DrainsCar Door DrainsAll cars have drains in certain areas that prevent water from stagnating in one place. There are drains in the doors and parts of the fender. You will also find a few of these under the car?s rocker panels and in other places underneath the car. These drains can be blocked by dirt or leaves, preventing water from escaping.Blocked drains means water sticks around inside your car, which means rust is going to be a problem.Check under the cars for any holes that look blocked. You often have a hose from under the front windshield going under the car, which needs to be drained and clean.5. All-Weather MatsCar Floor Mats WaterThe interior of the car must also be protected from moisture. When you get into your car, you often bring some snow or salt with you. This snow or salt may not be present in large quantities, but even a small amount can be fatal. Eventually, the floor of your car may rust. Your car chassis might become weak.You have to prevent this from happening. Fortunately, all you need to do is buy all-weather mats. These mats do not allow water, dirt, or other materials to get onto the carpet. In this way, they protect the floor, while at the same time allowing you to remove the harmful contents from the car without damaging anything else.6. Undercoating with OilUndercoating OilI talked about rust protection products and how they prevent corrosion under the car, but I did not mention that these products are a bit expensive. Some of you may not be able to afford rust protection.Fortunately, there?s a hack for that. You can borrow the expertise of old farmers who undercoated their trucks and tractors with used oil to prevent rust. Waste oil serves no other purpose and cannot be reused in a vehicle, but you can repurpose it as underbody rust protection.The oil absorbs all the dirt and salt from the roads and does not allow any of it to pass onto the metal. As long as the metal is protected from harmful materials, it stays in good shape."
Does washing my car in winter prevent rust?	Yes. Washing your car frequently during the winter is the best way to prevent your car from rusting. Remember that you need to use the right products to remove all dirt from the paint when washing it also.
How do I stop my car from rusting getting worse?	The best way is to remove the rust and apply some anti-rust spray around and over the area. Frequent washes also prevent it from rusting more.
Can I prevent rust from spreading?	"Once a piece of metal starts to rust on a car, it isn?t easy to make it stop without replacing the part or sanding it down completely and adding new paint. However, in some cases, you can add rust preventers, which slow down the rusting process."
Can washing your car cause rust?	"If you are washing your car way too frequently or using the wrong washing products, it can absolutely make your car rust more. However, rust from overwashing is less likely than rust from underwashing, which is usually the bigger problem."
How to Get Paint off a Car ?	"If you want to get fresh paint off a car, you want to act fast. At first, you might be able to use just water and soap. If that doesn?t work, you have to try something more powerful, such as lacquer thinner, gasoline, nail polish remover, or a rubbing compound. Here are some more detailed steps on how to get paint off a car:1. Water/Soap MixtureWater SoapIf the paint is fresh on the car, you might be able to get it off with some simple water and car wash soap. Obviously, you want to try this method in any instance because it is the least damaging.If your vehicle is sitting in the sun, the paint is going to bake on, making it more difficult to get off. That?s why you need to act fast if you plan to get it off with this simple method. Start by mixing warm water and car wash soap in a clean bucket. With a clean, soft rag, you can gently scrub the area. Do not use a dirty rag, or you can create scratches in the paint from the debris. Continue gently rubbing the area in a circular motion until all of the paint is removed. Once all of the paint is removed, you might choose to finish washing the car. Either way, you need to ensure that the area is dry. Use a microfiber cloth to dry all of the water spots. 2. Nail Polish RemoverNail Polish RemoverWhen soap and water don?t work, you need to kick things up a notch. Most households have nail polish remover on hand, but you want to make sure it is acetone-free. Any nail polish remover with acetone can damage the paint. With a clean rag, apply some nail polish remover to the paint splatter. It?s best to dab it on the area. Once the paint comes off, you want to rinse the area down with water to avoid damaging the car?s paint. 3. Lacquer ThinnerLacquer ThinnerIf the paint won?t come off with soap and water or nail polish remover, it?s probably already too dry. You will need something more powerful, such as lacquer thinner. Lacquer thinner is a strong solvent that cleans substances off of wood, but you can also use it on your vehicle.Use a clean rag to apply the thinner and remove the paint. As the paint starts to come off, use warm water to get the lacquer off of your automotive paint before it erodes that as well. To protect your car paint, you want to start with a minimal amount of thinner. You can always add more if you need to later. 4. GasolineGasolineAnother handy item you might have in the garage is gasoline. It works similar to the nail polish remover and lacquer thinner. You will want to dab a small amount on a clean cloth and apply it to the paint splatter.If you decide to scrub the area, do so gently. Don?t push too hard, or you could remove the original paint on your vehicle. As soon as the paint splatter is coming off, you need to rinse the area with water to remove all of the gasoline. Dry the vehicle to remove all water spots. 5. Rubbing CompoundRubbing CompoundIf you have some time and want to remove the paint safely, try a rubbing compound instead. This method will take some patience, but it?s the best way to remove stubborn splatters without damaging the paint. Put some of the rubbing compound onto your clean, soft rag. Scrub the area in a circular motion, but only apply gentle pressure. If you are working on a large area, just focus on a small spot at a time. Trying to do too much at once can lead to damage to your paint.After you remove the paint, it?s best to wash and wax the car. This step helps protect the paint from any further damage. "
Can I Sand off Dried Paint?	"If all else fails, you might need to sand your car to remove the paint. This isn?t a step you want to take lightly. Sandpaper and some elbow grease are sure to get the dried paint off of the car, but it can also remove the good paint too. If you choose to use sandpaper, you want to move very slowly and pay attention to what you are doing. RELATED: How Much Does a Car Paint Job Cost?To sand off dried paint, you wash and dry the vehicle first. Once you are finished, you need to section off the paint splatter with some automotive masking tape. After the rest of the vehicle is protected, you can start sanding.Ideally, you will use wet-dry 300-grit sandpaper. Once you have removed the paint splatter, you want to transition to 1200-grit sandpaper. Once you are finished, clean the sanded area because you don?t want to leave behind anything that can scratch up the surrounding paint. I recommend washing the area before removing the tape. "
Should I Get a White or Black Car?	"White cars are fashionable, easy to clean, simple to sell, provide good visibility, and keep the temperature cool. However, white cars don?t hide dirt well, show rust, and there?s an abundance of them. Black cars are elegant and hide rust, but they get hot, are harder to clean, and attract birds.While this is just a quick answer, there is much more to it. Now, I?ll look at the pros and cons of both white and black cars, so that you can make your decision."
Pros of a White Car	"1. FashionableWhite cars continue to be one of the most popular car colors, with many automakers offering the color as a free option. It?s universal and looks good in any setting.Blending in can be a good thing, especially if you don?t want to excite the senses of cops as you drive by. If you are looking for the most practical option, you can?t go wrong with white. 2. Easy to CleanWhite is one of the easiest car colors to clean. You won?t see smudges and water spots as easily, making washing and waxing an easier job.If there are scratches on the paint, they are also harder to see. Even if you do need to add some paint for a touch-up, you will probably pay less for it than a comparable black hue. This is also one of the reasons why you often see car manufacturers at car shows using white cars because it is difficult to see small imperfections.3. Easy to SellBecause white cars are so popular, you won?t have any trouble selling them, either. Everyone wants white cars, so you will have a long list of potential buyers.If you don?t want to search for the right buyer, white is a great option. Plus, you won?t have trouble getting a dealership to take it off of your hands. 4. Lower TemperatureIf you have ever been to a really hot country, you probably saw that the majority of the cars are often white. White colors reflect sunlight, leaving the inside of the car cooler than other options. There?s nothing cooler than a white car in the summer, ensuring you don?t have to overwork the air conditioning system. If you live in a hot, humid area, you will appreciate any help you can get. However, it might not matter as much to you if you live in the north. White paint is also preferable in hot countries, because the paint will not burn as easily from the sun.5. VisibleIt?s easier to see a white car than it is a black one. If you spend a lot of time driving in low-light situations, you will want this added protection.However, the right exterior lighting can ensure any color car can be adequately seen. The only time a white car becomes difficult to see is in heavy snow. "
Cons of a White Car	"1. Doesn?t Hide DirtYou won?t have trouble hiding the dust on a white car, but dirt and mud are very noticeable. You may need to visit the car wash more often. Thankfully, it?s easy to get clean. The only downside is you really can?t tell the car is clean once it?s done. You don?t get the same shocking appeal after a car wash that comes with a black car.Especially if you live in a cold country with snow where they put salt on the road, the white paint color will look yellow or orange and it will be difficult to keep it clean! So you need to consider the conditions in your country first!2. Overabundance on RoadAs you head down the road, you can quickly become immersed in a long list of other white cars. It can be difficult to stand out at all.This might not seem like a problem until you are trying to find your car in a crowded parking lot. You have to be careful you don?t choose the wrong white car. 3. Easy to See RustAs any car ages, rust becomes visible. With a white car, the rust becomes more visible than with many other colors. White paint isn?t as forgiving with rust. If it begins rusting, you will want to repair it, especially before you try to sell it. "
Pros of a Black Car	"1. ElegantThere?s no other color as elegant as the black car. That?s why many luxury cars drive down the street with a black finish. Black cars also look powerful and more aggressive. When the car is clean, nothing else can compare. Black cars are also one of the car colors that hold the resale value best, probably due to the elegance of a black car, along with its popularity.2. Hides RustThere may not be a lot you can hide on a black car, but rust can?t be seen. When a black car starts to corrode, it?s very difficult to notice.Additionally, you should be able to easily match the black paint if you want to touch up damaged spots. There?s much more leeway when working with black paint than many others. "
Cons of a Black Car	"1. Hard to CleanThe black car looks amazing when it is clean. However, it?s difficult to get it to look its best, and it never lasts for long.One of the biggest disadvantages of black cars is that you will see every water spot after the wash, requiring that you dry it appropriately. You will also need to use high-quality polish and wax because scratches and swirl marks on the car paint from car washes are very easy to see. Dents are also, unfortunately, very visible on a black car.2. Prone to Bird DroppingsBlack cars love to collect dirt. However, that?s not all that likes to build up on darker cars. For some reason, black cars also attract birds. Where there are birds, there is also a ton of white poop stains. These don?t just look horrible, but they mean you must clean the car again ? otherwise, the car paint can get damaged.3. Gets HotUnlike the white car, black colors retain heat. After a couple of minutes of sitting in the sunlight, the interior of the car is going to be very hot.You will have to push the air conditioner to work harder. Additionally, the car can be downright miserable until it gets cooled down. In hot countries, the black paint can also get damaged by the sun due to the heat."
Black or White Car: Which is Better?	"So, which of these is the best car color? If you are trying to decide between a black vs. white car, you have a lot of factors to consider. Both white and black are at the top of the most popular colors. Not only do you need to think about the look you are going for, but it?s important to consider your climate, as well.If you want a practical, easy to clean, and cool vehicle, go with something white. However, if you want something elegant and don?t mind spending more time on maintenance, then black is a better option."
How Much Does A Car Wrap Cost?	"You can expect a cost of $1,500 to $6,000 to wrap an entire car, depending on the type of car, type of wrap, and the garage doing the job. But the cost of a car wrap can vary greatly depending on which factors.As we?ve discussed, the majority of the cost is going to be tied up in labor, not materials. Because of this, the installer must factor in the complexity of the job, the type of decal you want, and how big your vehicle is before giving you an accurate quote. For a smaller coupe, it?s possible to get a simple car wrap installed for $2,000. However, if you drive a larger coupe or sports car, you might pay upwards of $3,000, while a compact truck, SUV or van could cost you $3,500.If you add special treatments, such as a carbon-fiber appearance or metallic colors, you need to prepare to pay more. Additionally, chrome treatments start at $6,000 and only get more expensive. If you want something completely custom or you are going for the exotic look, be prepared to spend up to $10,000 until all is said and done. You may also be without your vehicle for a few days while the job is done. Some models have bumpers that are difficult to remove. Plus, there are some areas of a car that can be difficult to wrap, such as the doorjamb. When you take your vehicle to get a car wrap, ask for an estimate on the cost and the time you will be without a ride."
what are the Car Wrap Cost Factors ?	"There are a few factors that you need to consider before finding the right car wrap cost for your car model. Here are 4 common factors you need to look at.1. Car TypeSmall Big CarThe majority of the cost you incur when getting a vehicle wrap is for labor. The process can be quite a labor-intensive undertaking, especially on a larger vehicle. If it is done right, the installation won?t be rushed. This is why the installer will base the cost on how large the vehicle is. Compact cars and coupes are generally the least expensive to wrap. From here, the family sedan or compact crossover will be the next least expensive. Wrapping a full-size SUV, luxury sports car or truck is probably going to cost you the most.However, the car type is looked at not just by size but also the design of the exterior. For example, if you are driving a Tesla, you might find the price is lower, simply because of the smooth car surface.2. Colors or OptionsWrapping CarYour vehicle wrap contains multiple vinyl decals that get applied around your car, on every panel, the hood, fenders, roof and doors. The wrap needs to cover every part of the body, leaving none of the original paint colors to shine through below. Plus, vinyl wraps are completely customizable, with chrome finishes, glossy options and metallic colors. Wraps are all created with the help of a computer, offering never-ending possibilities.With that said, there are a lot of options and colors that can add to your price very quickly. If you want a generic color applied, your cost will likely be much less than the driver searching for a custom look. 3. Car ConditionYour vehicle should be in pristine condition to have a wrap installed. If there are dents, dings or scratches, they need to be repaired first. This extra step adds more money to the car wrap installation.Just as you wouldn?t paint your vehicle with imperfections, you aren?t going to wrap your car with them either. Otherwise, all of these blemishes will shine through and your money will be wasted. A knowledgeable installer is going to properly wash and detail your car first. They will also fix any imperfections. 4. Wrap Application ProcessAfter the repairs are made and the car is detailed, the application begins. For a high-quality installation, you want to have all of the bumper covers, taillights and headlight assemblies removed. While the installer could put them on without taking this step, you will notice a better application because of this diligence.It will also help the decals adhere better, but is going to cost you more money in the end. You have to ask yourself whether you want to pay more for a shop that takes the extra time and does it right or if you would rather have a cheap wrap put on that might not last."
Is Wrapping a Car Cheaper Than Painting a Car?	"Yes, it?s usually slightly cheaper to wrap a car instead of painting it, but the difference isn?t huge. You can expect the average car wrap to cost $1,500 to $2,500, while a car paint can cost $2,000 to $3,000. However, this depends a lot on the type of car wrap and paint."
How Long Does a Wrap Last on a Car?	"A car wrap usually lasts around 6 to 8 years on average in a normal climate. However, this depends a lot on the quality of the car wrap and how well the job is done. The weather can also have a big impact. Wraps usually don?t hold up as well in hot weather because the heat can cause them to bubble and peel. They also don?t last as long when it?s freezing temperatures because it can damage the adhesive on the wrap."
Do Wraps Damage The Paint?	"A car wrap usually won?t damage the paint if it is applied and removed correctly by a professional. The risk is that if you are not careful when removing the wrap, you can rip off the original paint due to the strong adhesive. However, if it?s done by a professional, this should not be a problem."
How Do I Wash Car Wraps?	"When you have a wrapped car, it is recommended to only hand wash your car and also use products recommended for wrapped paint. However, modern wraps are quite tough, so in most cases you can just use regular mild car shampoo. Be careful with high-pressure automatic car washes, though."
How much does it cost to wrap a car yourself?	"If you do the wrapping part yourself, the car wrap cost will be much cheaper and you can expect a total cost of $500 to $750, depending on the quality of the wrap. The wrap itself is not that expensive, but it is the time-consuming job that costs a lot. However, wrapping a car yourself is very difficult and if you have never done it before, the risk of a bad result is high."
How much does it cost to wrap a car matte black?	"If you want to wrap the car matte black, it is often cheaper than other colors because the wrap material is slightly cheaper. When wrapping a car matte black, you can expect a cost of $1,000 to $4,000, depending on many factors such as wrap quality, car size and who is doing the work."
How Much Does It Cost to Wrap a Car Gold?	"You can expect a total cost of $3,000 to $6,000 to wrap a car in gold, depending on factors such as car size, wrap quality, and labor costs. Wrapping a car in gold is often more expensive than other colors because the wrap itself is often a bit more expensive."
Conclusion	"Car wraps are a great way to make your car stand out and get noticed, and are definitely a good alternative to painting the car. They can also help protect the original paint, which can increase the value the day you sell it.The cost of wrapping a car will vary on many factors, such as the size and type of car you have, as well as the complexity of the design you choose. If you?re looking for a high-quality custom wrap, be prepared to pay around $3,000 or more.I hope this article helped you with your decision on whether car wrapping is right for you and your car and now you have all the knowledge you need about car wrapping."
Are Touchless Car Washes Better for Your Car?	"The touchless car wash is better for those who don?t want dirty sponges and materials from scratching the car?s paint. However, some touchless car washes use high-pressure and harsh chemicals, which can also damage the paint.So to decide if the touchless car wash is better for your car, you need to look at the types of touchless car washes and the regular car wash you are looking at. There are big differences between good and bad car washes. Let?s take a look at the pros and cons of each car wash."
What is a Touchless Car Wash?	"The touchless car wash uses high-powered jet streams of water to remove dirt and grime. The car wash also utilizes stronger detergents to ensure a deeper clean. There are no rags or sponges touching the car, so the water must be strong enough to clean the surface.You place your vehicle on a track, just as you would with a traditional car wash. The vehicle moves through the series of water jets and detergent sprays until it reaches the end. There is also a drying process that can be touchless as well. "
Touchless Car Wash Pros	"1. InexpensiveIt doesn?t cost a lot to get a touchless car wash. In some locations, you can spend as little as $5 to get your vehicle washed. You might also visit an establishment with a loyalty system. If you can get a punch card or pre-pay for the washes, you might be able to drastically reduce the price. 2. ConvenientIf you need to get some bird droppings off of the car, but you don?t have time, the touchless car wash might be the best solution. You can run through the car wash in a matter of a few minutes.If you were to hand wash the car, it could easily take an hour or more. Even the automated car wash can take far longer than the touchless option. 3. Protects Car PartsWith the touchless car wash, fewer vehicle parts can be harmed. The looser body parts and antenna aren?t going to touch sponges or moving components that can lead to damage.You can run through the touchless car wash without much worry about what could happen to these protruding parts. However, it?s still possible for damage to occur, which we will discuss next. "
Touchless Car Wash Cons	"1. Forceful Water Pressure In the conventional car wash, friction is used to remove dirt and debris from the paint surface. With the touchless car wash, these materials aren?t used. To make up for that, extra force must be pumped out from the water jets.Depending on the durability of the paint job, your car could become easily scratched or blemished from the high pressure. It can also cut right through the clear coat of a vehicle. 2. Harsh ChemicalsBecause friction isn?t used, the chemicals must also be more powerful. These harsh substances work with the high pressure to remove dirt. However, the harsh detergents can also start to break down the paint on your vehicle. It?s possible that the chemicals are not compatible with the clear coat on your vehicle, leaving the body work more susceptible to wear. 3. Treated WaterBefore the water can be used in a touchless car wash, it must first be treated. The company will run the water through a conditioning system to ensure it is softened.However, this process involves added salts to remove the minerals that naturally flow through water. With the buildup of salt in the water, a film can be left behind on the car?s paint, leading to more damage down the road. "
Will Touchless Car Wash Clean the Vehicle?	"The touchless car wash will never do as well as the hand wash can. However, it can be useful in a pinch. If you are looking for a quick refresh to get the majority of dirt off of the surface, the touchless car wash might work for you.However, don?t be surprised if you drive out of the other side with some dirt remaining. You might also see some water spots left behind. Depending on what you are trying to accomplish, you may wonder if it?s worth driving your car through the wash at all. It may be better just to leave the dirt in place until you can hand wash it. To decide, you have to weigh the benefits versus the potential disadvantages. "
Tips for Using Touchless Car Wash ?	"If you determine that using the touchless car wash is your best option, there are a few ways to further protect your vehicle from harm. Here are a few tips to consider.Check all windows and doors before driving through. You want everything to be tightly closed, ensuring that water doesn?t infiltrate the cabin.If you control the speed that the vehicle moves, go especially slow through the dryers. The longer you can stay near the blowers, the fewer water spots will be left behind.Carry a clean microfiber cloth with you. Once you exit the touchless car wash, you can wipe it down yourself to remove any more moisture that?s left behind. Look for ways to save money on the car wash. It?s possible that the establishment offers a loyalty discount. If the car wash is part of a gas station, you might also be able to save some money if you purchase a full tank of fuel too. By using caution, you can ensure the touchless car wash is safer. However, there?s nothing compared to taking the time needed to hand wash your vehicle. Try to set aside time monthly to wash your vehicle the right way if you want to further protect the paint."
What is a Full Service Car Wash?	"The full service car wash ensures a deep cleaning of the vehicle, both inside and outside. A complete detailing is performed on the exterior and interior. You can expect a spotless finish that helps the vehicle look like it just drove out of the showroom.It?s usually the highest option at most commercial car wash locations. Therefore, it will take the most time and be the most expensive choice. "
Full Service Car Wash Pros	"1. Best ValueThere?s nothing cheap about the full service wash. It?s going to cost more than the standard exterior wash and it won?t be performed in the automatic car wash. While the cost is significantly more, the value is unbeatable.Let?s say you spend $15 for an express car wash that sends your vehicle through an automated machine. You aren?t getting much for that amount of money. On the other hand, you could spend $100 to $200 for a full wash and get every available service. When you break down what you are paying for, the full service wash turns out to be a better investment overall. 2. High-Quality Products UsedIf you take your vehicle through the automatic car wash, cheap products are going to be used. Many of these cleaners contain abrasive and harmful chemicals that can actually lead to damage of the car paint. If you regularly visit these car washes, you may notice a foggy appearance to the paint over time.On the other hand, the full service car wash service is going to use high-quality products on your vehicle. These are going to be the best of the best, guaranteed to work well on vehicles. Additionally, many companies are switching over to eco-friendly products that only make you feel better about the purchase.3. Complete CustomizationWhen you pay for a full service wash, you have more flexibility to choose what?s important to you. Most detailers are going to let you choose from a list of services and add what you want. You can be picky about what you choose and try to keep the price to a minimum or you can go all-out and have everything performed.Here are a few of the services that might be offered:Window cleaningWheel DetailingTire cleaningHeadlight restorationInterior detailingEngine bay cleaningRain-X applicationWax or polish applicationIf you do choose to get all of the services performed, ask for a discount. It should be slightly cheaper per item if everything is included. 4. Includes Hand Wash/DryThe best way to protect the car?s paint is to hand wash the vehicle. With a full service wash, most providers will hand wash the vehicle instead of sending it through the machine.Instead of getting the dull finish that comes from the automatic or the annoying swirl marks, you can be sure your car?s paint looks showroom worthy. There won?t be any water spots either because the car will be hand dried instead of going through the automatic blower. Your car?s surface will be wiped down with microfiber cloths, ensuring a perfect finish. "
Full Service Car Wash Cons	"1. CostThe biggest downside to choosing a full service car wash is the price. Instead of spending $15 on an express wash, you could be looking at well over $150 for all of the services you choose.That?s ten times as much money. However, when you look at the value you receive for this amount, you see that the full service wash actually gives you more for your money. 2. TimeThere?s nothing better than driving through an automatic car wash and coming out a few minutes later with a clean vehicle. Anyone can find time to do this and make it look like the car is taken care of.However, when you need a full service wash, you must be prepared to give up your vehicle for a longer time. You also aren?t going to sit inside of it while it?s detailed. Some people choose to have the car cleaned during a lunch break when there?s a little extra time. "
What Are The Differences Between an Express vs. Full Service Car Wash?	"The main difference between an express car wash and a full service car wash is the cleaning and washing done. A full service car wash will leave your vehicle very clean both on the inside and outside. An express car wash will be done quickly, usually on the outside only.We?ve already looked at the time and money cost difference. You aren?t going to need a lot of time to get an express wash and it only costs a little pocket change. On the other hand, you could spend an hour or more waiting for the full service car wash and it?s going to hurt your pocketbook.With the express car wash, you are going to run your vehicle through a machine. In the end, it might blow dry your car, but no employees will be touching the vehicle. With the full service car wash, employees are going to take the time to hand wash and dry your vehicle, both of which are better for the paint. There?s also no customization to the express car wash. You pull up to the machine and pay for the service. Typically, it involves a touchless wash and dry. While children are usually thrilled to drive through the car wash, this isn?t normally what?s best for your vehicle and it won?t provide a spotless finish.Additionally, you may be able to add a few extra perks, such as a spray-on wax or Rain-X treatment, for additional money. However, there?s no comparison to the customization available with the full service wash. If you want a complete detail performed on the vehicle, this is your best option. "
How Long Does Full Service Cash Wash Take?	"The time it takes for your full service car wash can vary from twenty minutes to several hours. There are numerous factors that change the time taken. For starters, it matters what services you choose. The more you expect from the car wash, the longer you can plan on it taking.Additionally, you must consider how busy the company is. If you need to make an appointment, you should be able to get in and out quicker than if you just show up during a busy time.Most companies provide an indoor or outdoor waiting area where you can relax while the car gets cleaned. If it?s going to take a while, you might prefer getting picked up, so you can go about your day without putting pressure on the workers. "
How to Save Money at the Full Service Car Wash?	"There?s no cheap way to get a full service car wash. You can expect to spend a good chunk of money on the service, but there are still ways to keep more money in your pocket.Here are a few tips that might help you save.Keep your car clean. The cleaner your vehicle is, the less work the team has to do. Get more frequent service. While this might cost you more initially, the fact that the car will always be clean helps the team get the job done faster. If you are visiting more often, the cost might go down.Shop around. You can shop all of the local companies to see who offers the best price. However, the lowest price doesn?t always mean that?s who you should go with. It?s also important to research customer reviews to ensure your money is well spent.Sign up for a loyalty plan. Some companies will offer a discounted package if you are frequently visiting. Maybe you get a free wash after ten or you earn a discount for prepaying. Either way, the savings will add up.While it?s important to save money, don?t ever skimp on the tip. Many of the workers rely on these tips to earn an income, so you don?t want to cut them short, especially if they do a great job."
How Much To Tip At A Full Service Car Wash?	"If you should tip after a full service car wash depends on the quality of service you received. If you feel that the employees did a good job, it is common to leave a tip. Tipping is not required but always appreciated by hard working staff. The amount you tip is up to you, but $5-$20 is typical for a full service car wash."
What Does A Full Service Car Wash Include?	"A full service car wash usually includes an exterior wash of the car, a thorough interior vacuuming, and a cleaning of all interior surfaces. Some places may also offer additional services such as polishing, engine bay cleaning, and headlight restoration. Most full service car washes are customizable, so be sure to tell them what you want in advance."
How Much Does A Full Service Car Wash Cost?	"A full-service car wash costs anywhere from $70 to $250 on average. However, there are many factors that can affect the price, such as the location of the car wash, the type of vehicle you have, and the services included in the package."
Is Car Wax Used In A Full Service Car Wash?	"Whether car wax is used on your car?s paint at a full service car wash depends on where you get it done. This will be included in most full service car washes, but it?s best to ask them ahead of time to make sure you?re getting what you pay for."
Conclusion	"A full-service car wash can be a great way to keep your car looking new and clean without any effort on your part, but it?s important to weigh the pros and cons before deciding whether or not this is the right option for you.A full-service car wash is quite expensive to get done frequently, but it can be worth it every once in a while if you are not a good car detailer yourself. I hope you enjoyed this article and now have all the knowledge you need to decide if a full service car wash is for you."
What are Steelies?	"Steelies is a nickname to describe steel wheels. Most steel wheels come with covers or hubcaps on top. They just don?t get more basic than that. These wheels are created from billets of steel that are pressed with hydraulic machinery. The cheapest wheels on the market are steel with alloy following close behind. Additionally, the steelies are popular and can be found on a variety of vehicles."
Pros of Steelies	"1. Low-CostIt doesn?t cost as much to produce steel wheels as some others. They are cheap to create and can be covered with a simple set of hubcaps or wheel covers. The steel wheel has been standard on all budget vehicles for many years. You will see it as the standard equipment on many of the budget-friendly cars. 2. RuggedSteel is constructed from carbon and iron, making it harder than most other designs. In fact, steel wheels are often used for winter travel, mainly because of how durable they are.You will often find steelies on off-road vehicles for this reason. Additionally, if the steel wheels are damaged during these off-road activities, they are cheaper to replace. "
Cons of Steelies	"1. HeavierWith increased durability and strength comes more weight. When compared apples to apples with aluminum, the steel wheel is going to weigh much more. The added unsprung weight of steel wheels can increase difficulty with handling. You might notice some differences when taking tight turns or trying to maneuver. 2. Lack of DesignThere?s not a lot of flexibility in steel wheel design. You aren?t going to find a range of options because of how the steel wheel is produced. In fact, the only designs that can be made with the steel wheel are to put holes in the face, which also help with brake cooling.Additionally, it?s hard to find steel wheels in a range of sizes. You won?t be able to get many steel wheels in the larger diameters. Still, it?s possible to put hubcaps on the wheel or paint the metal to make it look better. Just be careful because if you don?t paint the wheels the right way, rust could form. "
differences between Steelies and Alloys ?	"Alloy wheels have some aluminum in the construction, making them more fashionable. Additionally, alloy wheels are lighter because of the metal concoction. What you are left with is more agility and better handling. Plus, alloy wheels are available in a much wider range of sizes, even some that are 20 inches. The steel wheel is going to be heavier and won?t look as nice. However, these wheels will likely be cheaper and geared more toward the budget-minded consumer."
differences betweenSteelies and Chrome ?	"The chrome wheel might look the best of all three, with a mirror-like shine. There?s certainly something to say about the head-turning ability of sleek chrome wheels. However, it?s not just the style that chrome wheels offer, but also protection. Because the chrome sits on the wheel as a protective coating, there?s less chance of oxidation, thereby preventing the instance of rust.Chrome wheels also offer a level of strength against off-roading, making them better than alloy wheels, but maybe not as durable as steel. You can even find some chrome wheels that are lower-cost, making them more affordable than you might think.However, chrome wheels can be difficult to keep in good condition. You must clean the wheels regularly to ensure that the finish doesn?t flake off. These wheels must be polished and you should avoid letting salt or brake dust sit on the surface. Additionally, chrome wheels can be heavy, which might reduce performance. The chrome wheel is created by adding multiple metal layers, such as copper and nickel, to the base material. Then, chrome plating is applied. With all of these layers in place, the chrome wheel can easily weigh the most. "
How Much Do Steel Wheels Cost?	"If you need a replacement steel wheel, you might spend between $45 and $90, although the price varies widely based on the size you need. If you are adding a tire to the purchase, the price also jumps up accordingly. Alloy wheels can be slightly more expensive, but still quite reasonable. These prices start around $50 per wheel, so you can still get a set on a budget.On the other hand, it?s easy to spend much more on a high-quality set of chrome wheels. While you can get the shiny look for as low as $100 per wheel, there are some designs that cost thousands. Aside from a stylish look, there?s not much more benefit to justify the cost of chrome wheels. Deciding what?s best for you requires that you examine the way you drive, your budget and your desires."
What Are The Key Differences Between A Muffler and A Resonator?	"The muffler reduces overall exhaust noise, while the resonator only cancels out particular frequencies. Also, mufflers create backpressure, so there?s some performance hindrance, while the resonator has less restriction and baffling in the design. Still, both the muffler and resonator impact the exhaust noise. Additionally, all new cars have mufflers, but not all vehicles have a resonator. When a resonator is installed, it?s usually paired with a muffler. What?s most interesting is the configuration of the muffler and resonator. If both are installed from the factory, the resonator typically comes before the muffler. However, that?s not always the case. Some setups have the resonator placed after the muffler."
What Is A Muffler?	"The name of the car muffler tells you a lot about what it does. It?s designed to muffle out any unwanted noise from the exhaust. It?s going to lower the volume of the exhaust sound without altering it or canceling it out, such as the resonator does. The muffler is made with perforated tubes and it is linked to the resonator chamber through an exhaust pipe. Within the muffler, the sound is reflected, so the waves can cancel each other out. The sound waves first come from the resonator chamber if it is installed. After the sounds reflect on the muffler?s walls, the waves enter into a different tube within the muffler that leads to the exhaust outlet. After the muffler, the exhaust enters the tailpipe before being released into the atmosphere. A performance muffler reduces back pressure. With less pressure on the motor, you can expect a longer life and the engine may require less maintenance. Performance mufflers are also known as sports mufflers in some circles. "
what is Muffler Features ?	"Now that you understand the basics of the car muffler let?s examine a few of the top features. Here are just a few of the facts you should know about mufflers. Designed to soften the volume of the exhaust notesTone is determined by the tube pattern and the included bafflesExhaust sound volume is also determined by the tube pattern and the included bafflesFunctions well at any RPM levelBecause of the varying designs, mufflers can make a variety of sounds. You can install a muffler that creates a high-pitched sound or pick one that outputs sound that is throaty and deep. "
What Is A Resonator?	"The exhaust resonator morphs sound frequencies made from the combustion process. The resonator is located before the muffler in most configurations. Because of the work the resonator does, the muffler has less to do. The resonator looks like a hollow chamber. However, the interior is much smaller than the housing that you are looking at. That?s because there is steel wool wrapped around the inner part of the tube. Around that is the material responsible for sound deadening. Resonators are designed to work hand-in-hand with the muffler. However, unlike the muffler, the resonator only reduces sounds at certain frequencies and RPM ranges. "
what is the Resonator Features ?	"The car resonator is known for having certain characteristics and features. Here are a few to consider.Used in conjunction with a muffler to reduce noiseEliminates the drone that?s caused by using a muffler aloneOnly designed to work at certain frequencies and RPM rangesThe resonator isn?t automatically installed on cars from the factory. There are some models that don?t have a resonator and other people that choose to remove it. If you are buying a used car, you?ll want to see if the resonator has been removed. "
Which One Should You Remove For A Louder Exhaust Sound?	"Some people choose to remove the muffler or resonator to create a louder exhaust sound. Which one is the better part to remove? Resonators aren?t going to impact the sound volume as much, so you won?t get a much louder exhaust by removing it. To get a louder sound, you would need to remove the muffler.However, some people find benefits to removing both the muffler and the resonator. It all comes down to a personal decision. It?s best to examine both in-depth to help you determine what you want to do with your vehicle. "
what is Muffler Delete Basics ?	"The muffler delete involves you taking off the muffler from the exhaust. When the muffler comes off, the exhaust sound becomes louder and deeper. However, something has to go in place of the muffler once it is removed. Most people choose to use a straight pipe in its place. A muffler delete kit will also usually come with new exhaust tips. "
what is Muffler Delete Pros ?	Improved exhaust flow because of fewer restrictionsReduced vehicle weightMinor performance gainsMinimal cost involvedCleaner appearance
what is Muffler Delete Cons ?	"Extremely loud sounds createdCar may exceed local sound ordinances, leaving you open to a ticketIt may be illegal to delete the muffler in your stateMay trigger the Check Engine LightVoids warranties"
what is Resonator Delete Basics ?	"The resonator delete involves you removing the resonator from the exhaust system. With the resonator in place, the exhaust doesn?t have droning sounds or annoying humming noises. After taking them off, you will hear a different note, but it?s not the same as what comes from removing the muffler. "
what is Resonator Delete Pros ?	Changes the sound without increasing the volume muchReduces vehicle weightSlight increase in performance gainsAffordable modificationLegal in most states
what is Resonator Delete Cons ?	May trigger the Check Engine LightVoids warrantiesCould create a rough idle
Which Is Better: Muffler Delete or Resonator Delete?	"It?s impossible to determine which one you should remove. The decision has to be based on your local laws and what you are trying to achieve. In most cases, you aren?t going to see huge performance gains from removing the muffler or the resonator. Only minor improvements will be noticed either way. If you want to gain more horsepower, you are better off looking at other options, such as a cold air intake.If you are hoping for a louder volume to the exhaust, you want to remove the muffler. The muffler is the component that affects loud and softer sounds. On the other hand, the resonator delete only changes the tone of the car. It?s not going to get any louder without it. Some people choose to replace just one of the parts, while others find taking off two is better. You can complete an entire exhaust system overall to customize it just the way you want it. "
"Which is better, a muffler or a resonator?"	"They are both part of the exhaust system, so neither is better than the other. They have a different purpose, while they both change the sounds from the exhaust. The muffler adjusts the volume of the sound, while the resonator changes the tone. "
What comes first resonator or muffler?	"Normally, the resonator comes before the muffler, but it can be done the other way as well. In the typical exhaust setup, the muffler comes right before the tailpipe. However, if either of these are removed, they can be replaced with a straight pipe instead. "
Do I need a muffler if you have a resonator?	"The car will run without a muffler or a resonator. However, the sound might be too loud without a muffler and you could be breaking some local laws. The muffler is always installed from the factory on a new car, but not all new cars have a resonator. "
Are mufflers or resonators louder?	"The resonator doesn?t affect the loudness of the exhaust sound. It?s only used to change the droning and humming noises. Having the muffler removed makes the system louder overall. The muffler?s job is to reduce the sound, basically to muffle it. "
Does removing a resonator increase HP?	"You can gain a small performance increase by removing the muffler or resonator, but neither of these is going to make a dramatic impact. If you want to truly increase horsepower, you should look to other performance modifications, such as adding a cold air intake. "
Conclusion	"When it comes down to understanding the muffler and resonator, it?s important to figure out that they work together for a common purpose. With the factory setup, the car is designed to have a muffled and restrained sound."
Flowmaster Super 44 vs. Super 40: Which Is Better?	"Depending on what your needs are, both of these Flowmaster mufflers are great options. The Super 40 is constructed of aluminized steel, while the Super 44 contains stainless steel. Additionally, the Super 40 has the thicker case of the two, plus a wider design overall. When it comes to sound, the Super 40 is known for its subdued tones. On the other hand, the Super 44 is going to give you the aggressive, deeper tone you might be looking for. It?s also important to consider the pricing and warranty of the two. While they have comparable prices, more than stock mufflers, the Super 44 with Stainless Steel has a better warranty. For about the same amount of money, you get a lifetime warranty versus a three-year warranty, proving that the Super 44 is a better value overall. "
what is Flowmaster Super 44 Muffler and pros and cons ?	"The Super 44 is made from stainless steel, making it superior to the Super 40 based on construction alone. It?s the upgraded version of the Super 40, which has been built with aluminized steel instead. This better construction means increased durability. The stainless steel option also has a lifetime warranty, ensuring you get the coverage needed if there are any mechanical defects. The price isn?t unreasonable, which makes the lifetime warranty even more attractive.If that?s not enough, the Super 44 muffler is compact and small. It will fit in a variety of vehicles, making it easy to upgrade just about any car. ProsDeep, aggressive soundDurable stainless steel constructionLifetime warrantyCompact, easy to fit in a variety of carsSimple installationConsIsn?t as loud as some mufflersDelta Flow Technology doesn?t silence inner resonanceFlowmaster Super 40 MufflerThe Flowmaster Super 40 was the version of the Super 44 before it existed. It?s constructed from aluminized steel. This material provides some corrosion resistance for added life but not enough as stainless steel.The case is nice and thick, allowing sound to echo. However, the thicker and bulkier case makes it difficult to fit all cars. If you don?t have a lot of room to play with, you could have trouble getting the muffler in place. There?s also the importance of the warranty. Because it?s made from aluminized steel, Flowmaster only puts a three-year warranty on this model.ProsBetter sound than an OEM mufflerDurable constructionCorrosion-resistantConsNot as durable as stainless steelToo bulky for some vehiclesOnly a 3-year warranty"
Key Differences Between Flowmaster Super 44 and. Super 40	"To determine which Flowmaster muffler is right for you, it?s important to look at a few different characteristics between the two. Let?s examine the construction, design, price, sound, performance and installation. 1. ConstructionNeither of these mufflers is made with sub-par materials. The Super 40 is built from aluminized steel, which provides plenty of durability. On the other hand, the Super 44 has been upgraded to stainless steel. This material offers a little more life and better corrosion resistance. 2. DesignThe Flowmaster Super 40 is meant to work with a lot of cars, but not as many as the Super 44. This older design is bulkier and takes up more space.If you have a compact vehicle, you are going to have trouble with the Super 40. Instead, you may prefer the compact design of the Super 44. 3. PriceYou aren?t going to find a big price difference between the two Flowmaster mufflers. For most vehicles, we found the price to be right around $100 for either muffler. What?s important to look at is the price difference between these and a cheap muffler. You are going to spend more with either of these two Flowmasters. Yet, there are plenty of other brands on the market that cost far more than both of these. 4. SoundOne of the reasons you are looking to upgrade your muffler is probably to get a better sound out of the exhaust. With either of these mufflers, you will see a difference. However, there are some minor sound tones between the two.The Super 40 is the original muffler that made Flowmaster a household name. It creates a muscle-car sound because of the thick case. It?s powerful and deep, something worth bragging about.In comparison, the Super 44 is newer and better made. It?s not as loud, but definitely more aggressive. The deep sound is coveted by many enthusiasts today.With both mufflers, you do get the patented Delta Flow Technology. This advanced system keeps noise outside where it bellows, but you still get some interior resonance. 5. PerformanceWith both mufflers, you can expect similar performance results. Upgrading to either one can produce a little more horsepower, which is a good thing. However, there could be a minor decrease in the low-end power. The good news is that it?s not normally enough to be noticeable.Flowmaster doesn?t create these two mufflers for performance as the forethought. Instead, the tone and quality are what?s most important, with the performance taking a backseat. 6. InstallationIf you plan to install your own Flowmaster muffler, you want to know which one will be easier to put on. Let us start by saying that we don?t recommend putting on any muffler unless you have the experience. Working with the exhaust is tricky and can be dangerous if you don?t know what you are doing.Now that we got that out of the way, neither of them is much different to install. There are no special mechanics tools needed. Your common tool set should be just fine. Additionally, consumers find the Flowmaster to be easier to install than some other top brands, such as MagnaFlow. The company sends great documentation with the muffler, so you can tackle the job at home if you feel equipped."
Alternatives to Flowmaster Mufflers 	"If you find that these Flowmasters aren?t right for you, there are a few other options. Consider these brands.MagnaFlowThis brand makes performance mufflers ideal for some smaller vehicles. Many Mitsubishi and Hyundai owners find these to work well on the compact vehicles. The lineup of mufflers also looks good, with the stainless steel construction and wider stance. MagnaFlow mufflers have a deep rumble sound that can accent any vehicle. However, the instructions leave a lot to the imagination. If you aren?t sure how to install a muffler, these instructions aren?t going to help you very much. Dynomax Dynomax makes a Super Turbo muffler that?s a great contender. It fits a variety of vehicles and creates a deep sound. It?s not quite as noisy as the Flowmaster, but definitely better than your stock equipment.The larger flow tubes help to reduce back pressure and keep the exhaust flowing for increased performance. There?s also fiberglass matting installed to reduce interior resonance. This muffler also comes with a lifetime warranty, making it a great value for the money. "
Is the Flowmaster Super 40 or 44 louder?	"If you are strictly determining which one is louder in decibels, the Super 40 might win. However, the Super 44 has a more aggressive and desirable sound because it?s the upgraded model. With the Delta Flow Technology, interior resonance is also inhibited with both models. "
Which Flowmaster is the loudest?	Both the Flowmaster Super 40 and Super 44 are considered among the loudest in the lineup. The company also lists the Super 10 and 80 Series in this category too. It?s important to choose a muffler based on your application and vehicle type. 
What is Flowmaster?s quietest muffler?	"Flowmaster makes several mufflers that produce stock-like sounds. The company suggests getting the Super 50, 70 Series or 50 Series Big Block for minimal sound. If you want moderate sound, you may prefer the 50 Series Heavy Duty, HP 2, Pro Series, DBX Series, 50 Series Delta Flow or the 60 Series."
Is the Flowmaster Super 44 too loud?	"It depends on what you determine to be too loud. Flowmaster rates the Super 44 as one of the more aggressive-sounding mufflers, with noticeable interior noise. It?s rated alongside the Super 40, Super 10, the 40 Series and the 80 Series. "
Conclusion	"One of the biggest problems with trying to find a new muffler is determining which brand to choose. There are so many reputable brands to pick from, but we have come to enjoy everything that Flowmaster has to offer. As technicians, we know how easy they are to install and can?t complain about the sound these mufflers create. Two of our favorites are the Super 40 and Super 44.If you are trying to decide between the two, reread our evaluation to see which one excels in the categories that matter to you. While they are very similar, there are some distinct differences you need to understand."
What Are The Symptoms Of A Bad Oxygen Sensor?	"The most common bad oxygen sensor symptoms are poor engine performance and rough idle, along with a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice reduced fuel economy, and the car may fail an emissions inspection.Here is a more detailed list of the bad oxygen sensor symptoms:1. Check Engine Light IlluminatesCheck Engine LightOne of the most common bad oxygen sensor symptoms is a check engine light on your dashboard. In many cases, there can be a trouble code related to the oxygen sensor, and you don?t notice any other bad o2 sensor symptoms at all. All of the trouble codes P0030, P0031, P0130, P0131, P0132, P0133 and P0134 have to do with the oxygen sensors. You might also see P0137, P0140, P0141, P0161 or P0172 on your code scanner. With this in mind, you can see any number of trouble codes relating to an air-fuel mixture imbalance that could ultimately be caused by the oxygen sensor.2. Decreased Fuel EconomyFilling Gas In Diesel EngineInside the combustion chambers, there must be the right amount of air and fuel mixing. If there?s more fuel than air, your defective oxygen sensor might not be able to detect it. As more fuel burns in the engine, your gas mileage decreases. What you are left with is more money spent at the pump and more frequent trips to the gas station. 3. Rough IdleCar Engine Rough IdleIf you?ve noticed that the car runs roughly when it?s stopped or parked, the idle is off. Usually, a car should idle at around 1,000 or fewer RPMs. If it shoots up, that?s one of the bad o2 sensor symptoms.However, a rough idle isn?t always indicative of a bad oxygen sensor. It could mean any component that?s responsible for the air-fuel ratio is defective. That?s why you need to compare this symptom with the others. 4. Stalling EngineWhen the engine idle gets too rough, the motor could stall. This problem normally starts out as a misfire and doesn?t normally occur until the problem has been left unresolved. If the engine is unable to sustain the right amount of power to remain working, it will shut down. You should still be able to get it started again, but there are no guarantees.5. Poor Motor PerformanceIf the normal combustion process is interrupted, you can expect to notice trouble with the performance of the engine. It?s going to be weaker than normal, especially when you try to push on the gas pedal. At first, this problem can be so subtle that you don?t notice it?s occurring. The problems could continue getting worse until driving becomes cumbersome. That?s why it?s important to have the fault looked at as soon as you notice it, especially before the lack of acceleration leads to an accident on the road. If you notice that your engine performance has decreased, that?s a strong indicator that you may have a bad O2 sensor.6. Failed Emissions TestThe oxygen sensors are part of the emission control system in the vehicle. If they aren?t working, there could be an imbalance in the exhaust, which would be read through an emissions test. While there are numerous reasons you might fail these mandatory tests, the oxygen sensors tend to be a major culprit. If you have failed an emissions test, have the computer checked for codes that show you what the problem might be. 7. Strange SoundsWhen an oxygen sensor fails to monitor the air-fuel mixture, an abundance of carbon could build up in the combustion chamber. This problem could cause a lean-running mixture in the motor.With a lean mixture, you are left with pre-ignition that leads to pinging or knocking noises. However, these noises can also occur for other reasons, such as a clogged fuel injector, bad fuel, or engine damage. Most often, these noises are heard under engine load. 8. Catalytic Converter FailureWhat happens if you continue running the system with a bad oxygen sensor? Eventually, the catalytic converter will fail because of the imbalance of air and fuel. The oxygen sensors must be in optimal working order to prevent damage to the catalytic converter. It?s never cheap to replace a catalytic converter. For this reason alone, you want to fix the defective oxygen sensor because it causes bigger problems. "
where the Oxygen Sensor Location ?	"The oxygen sensor is found in the exhaust system. It can be found near the engine or on the exhaust manifold. Many cars have several oxygen sensors, but they are all monitoring the amount of oxygen in the exhaust.If the car has more than one oxygen sensor, the other will be located behind the catalytic converter. This sensor monitors the performance of the converter by comparing the readings occurring before and after. "
what is the Oxygen Sensor Function ?	"The car engine uses a combustion process that produces exhaust gases once the fuel and air have ignited in the cylinders. These exhaust gases contain several components, such as oxygen and carbon. The oxygen sensors monitor the level of these gases in the exhaust as it?s leaving the motor. Whatever oxygen is flowing through the combustion process is measured by this sensor.The information received from the oxygen sensor is sent back to the engine control module (ECM). This computer is in charge of processing all of the information so adjustments can be made to the air and fuel ratio. If the ECM reads that there?s too much oxygen, it will adjust other sensors to add more fuel and vice versa. Otherwise, you are left with either a lean- or rich-running condition that creates engine problems. Not only will the bad oxygen sensor cause engine troubles, but it can also lead to further damage to other components. For example, as the imbalanced exhaust continues to flow through the catalytic converter, you are allowing additional wear to this expensive part. That?s why repair should be performed as soon as possible. "
what is the Oxygen Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"On average, you might spend $50 to $450 to replace a bad oxygen sensor. However, this price is based on several factors. The type of car and engine you drive has a lot to do with the cost.If you are driving a small economy car, your cost is probably going to be much less than the larger SUV or truck. Luxury cars also have more expensive parts that increase the overall total. Additionally, you might need a specialty mechanic to work on your luxury brand, which you wouldn?t need if you were driving a small Chevy.The other major factor has to do with the labor rate. If you can replace the oxygen sensor yourself, there?s no reason to pay a professional mechanic. Considering the oxygen sensor might only cost you $20 to $175, you can save a lot of money figuring this out on your own. The service manual or a repair manual is quite helpful when it comes to these fixes.The trouble comes in when you wait to change the oxygen sensors. By procrastinating with this repair, you can allow other damage to occur. For this reason, what would have been a simple repair can quickly turn into something more costly. That?s why we always recommend changing the defective oxygen sensor at the first sign of trouble. Compare the costs of replacing an oxygen sensor with swapping out the catalytic converter. For a typical catalytic converter replacement, you are looking at an average of $1,000 to $2,500 to have it worked on by a professional. However, most of this cost isn?t related to the labor costs but how expensive the part is. That?s why it?s best to spend the money upfront and get the oxygen sensors working right than deal with what?s coming down the road as a result of neglect. "
What happens if you don?t replace the oxygen sensor?	"If the oxygen sensor isn?t replaced, the car?s computer won?t be able to monitor the air/fuel mixture accurately. As a result, the car?s engine will run either too rich (with too much fuel) or too lean (with not enough fuel). This can cause all sorts of problems, including excessive emissions, poor fuel economy. In the long run, it will cause excessive wear on the engine, which can damage expensive parts like the catalytic converter or internal engine parts."
Can I drive with a bad oxygen sensor?	"While you can drive your car with a bad oxygen sensor in most cases, it is not recommended, as it can cause the car to run lean or rich and potentially damage the engine. However, if you are on your way to the mechanic, you can still drive the car as long as you are aware of the potential risks."
Can I replace the oxygen sensor myself?	"Yes. Replacing an oxygen sensor is in most cases a fairly simple job. However, it depends on the make and model of your car. In some cases, if the car is older, the oxygen sensor can get stuck because of rust, and it can be difficult to remove it without special tools."
Will check engine light reset after replacing the O2 sensor?	"It depends on the make and model of your car. For most cars, the answer is ?yes.? The check engine light will reset after replacing the O2 sensor, but it can take a while. Every time you start the engine and warm it up, the car checks the emissions. It may take 10-20 successful cycles before the engine control module understands that the oxygen sensor is working and removes the light. So it?s definitely easier to clear the error code with a scanner."
Conclusion	"There are a few symptoms that can point to a bad oxygen sensor, but the best way to know for sure is by using an OBD-II scanner or letting a professional mechanic diagnose the car. If you notice any of these problems with your vehicle, be sure to take it in for service as soon as possible."
How to Unclog a Catalytic Converter Without Removing It ?	"You can unclog a catalytic converter without removing it by applying a fuel additive or using the ?Italian tune-up? method. In some cases, you may need to take the catalytic converter off to clean out the clog, which requires more skill and time. Here is some more detailed information on how to remove a catalytic converter without removing it:1. Fuel AdditiveAdd Fuel Additive CarThere are many high-quality fuel additives that will help to clean out the catalytic converter. Many people rave about the effects of CataClean fuel cleaner. You can also choose additives from Rislone, CRC, Chevron, STP and Lucas.Before you decide what additive to use, take some time to research the options. Depending on what symptoms you are facing and your budget, you might find that one suits you better than another. It?s important to follow all of the directions on the bottle that you choose. Most of them require the fuel tank to be filled to a certain degree and you will have to drive for a short time to feel any effects of the cleaner. Because this is the least expensive method and easiest way of cleaning, it?s often tried before anything else. However, cleaners are only meant to be effective if the catalytic converter isn?t completely clogged. The benefit of using the cleaners is that the entire fuel system gets attention. These formulas can remove contamination to the oxygen sensors and passageways.2.  ?Italian Tune-Up? MethodUnlike a conventional car tune-up, the Italian Tune-Up was created by Ferrari as a way to burn off unnecessary carbon buildup. If you are gentle on your car all of the time, you may not be getting the catalytic converter hot enough to burn through these deposits, leading to a clog. For maximum effectiveness, you want the cat to reach between 800 øF and 1,832 øF.Push your engine to run under full throttle for as long as possible. If you can step on the accelerator hard while pulling out or get on a track for full throttle laps, you will burn up some of those deposits sitting in the exhaust. Some people prefer to push the car engine hard for a minute during each drive, ensuring that buildup never occurs in the first place. However, you don?t want to constantly push your engine too hard or you could face other failures. Additionally, these methods should never be tried if you fear that engine components are already failing. Otherwise, you might deal with other auto repairs before you want to. "
Unclogging the Catalytic Converter by Removing It ?	"If the other methods haven?t worked for you, it?s time to take the catalytic converter off to clean it. Start by gathering some supplies for the job. You will need a large container and penetrating oil. It?s also important to have a secure floor jack and jack stands. Aside from these tools, you also need a pressure washer and impact wrench.Before you work on the catalytic converter, you must let the exhaust cool down. Otherwise, you could get burnt. You should also read through the steps in your car?s service manual for directions related to your particular model. Once the cat is cooled, follow these generalized steps unless they contradict anything found by the manufacturer.Jack up the car and secure it on jack stands.Remove the oxygen sensor.Use penetrating oil to get the bolts loosened.Take the catalytic converter off and inspect it. If there?s a rattle inside the cat, you will need to replace it. If nothing is heard, you may be able to continue cleaning it.With a pressure washer, wash out the catalytic converter at low pressure.Immerse the cat in degreaser and hot water.Rinse it back out with your pressure washer on low once again.Allow the catalytic converter to drain and dry completely.Once it is dry, you can reinstall the cat.Reinstall the oxygen sensor and secure everything back in place. If you run into trouble with these steps or you are unsure how to perform the cleaning, it?s best to visit a professional auto repair shop. You can also watch some YouTube videos that might help explain the process better. "
How To Tell The Catalytic Converter Is Clogged?	"1. Check Engine LightIn most cases of a clogged catalytic converter, the Check Engine Light will come on. Because there?s an issue with the emissions system, the sensors will trigger a malfunction that causes the warning light to illuminate. The only way to remove the Check Engine Light is to clean the clog out of the converter or replace the cat. You can determine what is causing the light to come on by reading the codes that come from your OBD-II diagnostic scanner.2. Failed Emissions TestIn some regions, you are required to go for regular emissions testing to get the car registered and inspected. However, when the emissions system isn?t running at full capacity, the vehicle could fail the test.You are sure to get a failed report when the catalytic converter is clogged because the vital part can?t exchange the harmful gases for those that are less toxic. However, other problems can also lead to a failed test, such as a bad oxygen sensor. For this reason, you will need your code scanner to figure out what?s going on. 3. Rotten Egg Smell When the catalytic converter becomes clogged, you may start to notice a rotten egg smell. Some people recognize that this odor comes from the Sulfur presence.Because the clogged cat can?t convert the pollutants properly, you are left with this obnoxious smell. Sadly, car air fresheners aren?t going to do the trick. You must clean or replace the converter to rid your vehicle of this smell. 4. Lack of Engine PerformanceWhen a clog occurs in the catalytic converter, back pressure within the exhaust can exist. Because the exhaust gets trapped, it can move back toward the combustion chamber. Your car?s engine must have the right balance of air and fuel at all times. If any exhaust comes back into the engine, you are going to notice some trouble with the performance. Additionally, the Check Engine Light will come on because of the imbalance if, for some reason, it isn?t already lit up. 5. Increased Fuel ConsumptionWhen the catalytic converter becomes clogged, the car can?t run as efficiently as it once did. The problem goes back to those trapped gases we just discussed. Any imbalance in the air and fuel ratio changes how much gas is needed to keep the car running.You may find yourself pushing harder on the accelerator to get the car to respond. You could also spend more time filling up the tank because of what?s being wasted. "
Catalytic Converter Maintenance ?	"If you want to avoid dealing with a clogged catalytic converter, it?s important to take good care of the exhaust system. Here are a few tips that will prevent clogs from occurring.Drive your vehicle often. It?s best to use the systems than to let them sit.Keep up with the regular maintenance. Oil changes, spark plug replacement and air filter service all help to keep the car running its best, so less needs to occur in the catalytic converter.Use higher octane fuel if recommended by the automaker.Fix any problems that occur right away. Running with defective systems can put more strain on the catalytic converter. When properly cared for, the catalytic converter should last ten years or more. For the small cost it takes to maintain your vehicle, it?s best to avoid replacement wherever possible. "
Cost to Replace a Clogged Catalytic Converter ?	"The average cost for catalytic converter replacement is between $900 and $2,500, although some cars can cost far more. The reason for the high cost has nothing to do with the labor charges. In fact, most catalytic converters are simple to replace.Instead, the cost is driven up due to the number of precious metals that are located within the catalytic converter. The more metals a converter uses, the more you can expect to pay for it. Additionally, some vehicles use more than one converter, making the cost even higher if they both need to be replaced. "
Can I Unclog a Catalytic Converter at Home?	"It doesn?t take a lot of expertise to clean the converter with simple methods. In fact, most people will start with a cheaper option before seeking professional help. By using an additive or running the Italian tune-up method, you are spending very little money and are only out a minimal amount of time. Even if you have to take the converter off to clean it, the process doesn?t take long. With some simple tools and equipment, you could give it a try in your home garage. "
Can I Use a Hammer to Unclog a Catalytic Converter?	"There are many sites online promoting the use of a hammer to bang out the loose debris within the catalytic converter. While this might unclog it, the method can also render your catalytic converter useless. The precious metals inside the converter must remain intact for the conversions to occur. Otherwise, the catalytic convert is simply hollowed out and your car could once again fail emissions testing. "
Can I Drive With a Worn Catalytic Converter?	"The worn catalytic converter may not hinder your vehicle from running unless it creates performance issues. However, you are allowing dangerous gases to enter the atmosphere, which hurts the environment. You could also go through more fuel than needed and fail an emissions test, so it?s best to have it cleaned out."
What Causes Catalytic Converter Failure?	"Catalytic converters get clogged and damaged when other systems aren?t functioning correctly. Whether there?s a buildup on the spark plugs or a malfunctioning oxygen sensor, the converter works harder, leading to failure. It can also be caused by carbon buildup from not heating up the converter enough. "
Is Cataclean Good for Cleaning the Converter?	"Cataclean is not a cure-all for clogged converters, no matter what you are told online. Still, this is one of the most effective cat cleaners on the market. It can help reduce buildup that leads to clogs and is often recommended for regular usage as a preventative maintenance option. "
Conclusion	"If your car isn?t running the way it should, your problem could be a clogged catalytic converter. Thankfully, you have multiple options when it comes to learning how to unclog a catalytic converter. Whether you choose to put an additive into the tank or you choose to try out the ?Italian tune-up? method, you may find it possible to clean the catalytic converter without taking it off of the car.Otherwise, your at-home efforts will require removing the catalytic converter from the vehicle. The worst-case scenario is that the catalytic converter will need to be replaced, which can be an expensive fix. For that reason alone, it?s important to take good care of the car engine and the converter."
Why Do People Steal Catalytic Converters?	"People steal catalytic converters because there are three precious metals in them that are worth a lot of money. These metals include rhodium, palladium and platinum. Metal recyclers pay a lot of money for these materials, with some types of catalytic converters bringing in more cash than others. On top of the valuable worth, catalytic converters are also easy to steal. It doesn?t take more than a few minutes for someone with experience to get the catalytic converter off of most cars. "
What is a Catalytic Converter?	"The catalytic converter is a part of the car?s exhaust system. It?s located between the muffler and the engine. Its purpose is to reduce how many harmful contaminants get into the atmosphere because of the engine exhaust. Inside the catalytic converter, there are precious metals that help to create a reaction, converting nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water vapor. In some vehicles, you can find multiple catalytic converters, but every automobile produced since 1975 has at least one. "
How Much is a Catalytic Converter Worth?	"The average worth of a catalytic converter is between $75 and $1,000. However, this value highly depends on what kind of vehicle you are driving and how old it is. The average converter contains about two to seven grams of palladium, one to two grams of rhodium and three to seven grams of platinum. Last year, the going rate for platinum was $1,100 per ounce, while palladium was worth $2,400 an ounce. Additionally, rhodium has an average worth of $18,000 per ounce. Therefore, it doesn?t take a lot of these precious metals to be worth a lot of money. The worst part of the situation is that you need to replace the catalytic converter after it has been stolen. You are going to pay far more for a new catalytic converter than the thieves received by selling your old one. Depending on what type of car you drive, you could easily spend $2,000 or more on a new converter, and that?s not including the labor to put it on. If you need to replace more than one cat, the price goes up proportionally. For this reason, it?s wise to have an insurance policy that covers theft, just in case the catalytic converter gets stolen. "
How are Catalytic Converters Stolen?	"The catalytic converter is located underneath the vehicle, so you would think it?s not simple to steal, but that?s not the case. Thieves are skilled at getting under the vehicle to the catalytic converter in mere seconds. Once under the chassis, the thief cuts the exhaust system to remove the cat.With a hand saw, the thief can get the catalytic converter off in just minutes. You won?t even know that the cat has been removed until you start the vehicle. "
How Do I Know if the Catalytic Converter Has Been Stolen?	"1. Noisy OperationThe easiest way to determine if the catalytic converter has been removed is to listen to the vehicle. The catalytic converter is part of the exhaust system, so it does help to muffle sounds.Once the cat is removed, there?s nothing stopping the exhaust from sounding raw and unfiltered. When you crank the engine, you should hear a loud roaring that startles you. This sound only increases when the car accelerates.2. Check Engine LightOnce you get over the loud roar, you might take a look at your dashboard and see that something has changed. Without the catalytic converter intact, the Check Engine Light is going to come on. This Check Engine Light indicates that a fault has been found. With your code scanner, you?ll see a fault related to the catalytic converter. 3. Engine SputteringAside from the engine noise, there could also be some performance issues. Not only will the noise get louder as you accelerate, but so will the performance complaints.Among the top complaints is an engine that sputters. The car may also not drive smoothly, causing the ride to be embarrassing and uncomfortable. 4. Increased EmissionsThe catalytic converter is meant to decrease emissions. Without it, the harmful gases are going to be prevalent in the exhaust smoke. For this reason, you could notice an increase in exhaust smells. The car also won?t pass an emissions test without the cat. 5. Loose PiecesBecause the thieves are in a hurry to remove the catalytic converter, it?s likely that the job wasn?t well done. For this reason, you might notice some pieces hanging down under the car.As you approach the vehicle, it might be possible to see the pieces. This condition should indicate there?s a problem before you even start the car engine. "
What Cars are Most Targeted for Catalytic Converter Theft?	"USA Today recently did a study identifying the most common vehicles to be targeted for catalytic converter theft. To determine these vehicles, service records were pulled from more than 60,000 repair shops around the county dated between 2019 and 2022. Additionally, CarFax helped to put together this compilation. If you have one of these vehicles, you are most at risk for cat theft. 1985-2021 Ford F-Series 2007-2017 Jeep Patriot1989-2020 Honda Accord1999-2021 Chevrolet Silverado2007-2021 Jeep Compass1990-2022 Ford Econoline1993-2020 Nissan Altima2011-2017 Chrysler 2002008-2014 Dodge Avenger2011-2019 Chevrolet CruzeThere are also some classifications of vehicles that are more prone to catalytic converter theft. For starters, hybrid vehicles continue to rise as victims. The Toyota Prius might be the most well-known, but all of them are susceptible. These converters often have higher levels of precious materials included, making them worth a higher cost.Additionally, trucks and SUVs are a target, but not necessarily because of their worth. With an increased ride height, thieves can get under the vehicle without a lot of work. Without the need for a jack, the thief can hide underneath without anyone seeing. Once under the vehicle, it takes a fraction of the time to remove the catalytic converter and get on their way. Finally, you have luxury cars and supercars to consider. These catalytic converters are naturally worth more and the cars tend to use more than one, thereby doubling the profit for a thief without having to do much more work. Sadly, these are also some of the most expensive cars to replace the catalytic converter."
How much do thieves get for a stolen catalytic converter?	"Thieves will get between $75 and $1000 for a catalytic converter, with most of them around $200. How much the thief gets from the catalyst depends on the type of catalyst and how much precious metals it contains."
What happens if my catalytic converter is stolen?	"If your catalytic converter is stolen, the noise from your car engine will be much louder than usual. There is also a risk that you will see a warning light on your dashboard. If your catalytic converter is stolen, you should contact your insurance company and take it to a mechanic."
What is the best catalytic converter anti-theft device?	There are many anti-theft devices for catalytic converters on the market. The best type is probably with metal shields around the catalytic converter so the thief won?t be able to cut it easily.
Do mechanics steal catalytic converters?	"No, the majority of mechanics do not steal catalytic converters. Of course, there are bad people in all professions, but most mechanics are honest people."
How Much Platinum is Recovered from a Catalytic Converter?	"On average, nearly all of the platinum found in the catalytic converter can be recovered during recycling. It might not be 100% of the platinum, but it?s close, with averages hitting 95% or higher. By being able to recover almost all of the 3 to 7 grams of platinum, you get the highest return when it?s time to recycle it. Platinum prices change frequently, so it?s important to check the current rate at the time of recycling. For example, right now, the average price for an ounce of platinum is around $940. Additionally, the only way this amount of platinum is recovered is by following an intricate process. It?s important to have a professional handling the materials during recycling. "
How is Platinum Removed from the Catalytic Converter?	"It is best to have a professional remove the platinum and other materials from the catalytic converter because it?s a dangerous operation. Before anything is done, it?s imperative that all proper safety precautions are followed. By wearing the proper personal protective equipment (PPE), you ensure that toxic fumes aren?t inhaled, thereby preventing dangerous respiratory illnesses. To get platinum from the catalytic converter, the inner honeycomb must be treated through a leaching process. Because platinum is inert, it will not dissolve in typical acids. Instead, a solution made from a potent oxidizing agent must be mixed with special acids to dissolve the platinum. This leaching process separates the platinum from the base metals for recycling. "
what is the Catalytic Converter Materials ?	"Platinum isn?t the only metal people are looking to get out of the catalytic converter. Yes, you can get a lot of money for this precious material, but there?s also the palladium and rhodium included in the construction that are important. These prices also change often, with the current average topping more than $2,000 per ounce. There?s also rhodium to consider. This is the most expensive of the three, with an average ounce costing $15,000 right now. However, the catalytic converter only houses about a gram of rhodium. Many people believe that there is gold in the catalytic converter, but that?s not the case. There are no other precious metals included in the catalytic converter, although there are plenty of other materials included in the build. The core or substrate of the catalyst can be made of several different materials, depending on the car. It could be ceramic, which seems to be popular because it?s inexpensive. There could also be metallic foil monoliths constructed of iron-aluminum-chromium combinations. "
How Much is a Catalytic Converter Worth?	"You can take your catalytic converter to the local scrap yard and get cash for it when you are done using it. On average, you could earn anywhere from $50 to $2,000, depending on several factors. It matters what vehicle model the catalytic converter came off of because some have more precious metals than others. It also depends on how used the catalytic converter is, with some degrading in value over time.Keep in mind that the recycler can?t pay you every dollar for what those metals are worth. They have to perform an expensive leaching process to remove these materials, so you can?t get every penny out of it. The yard also needs to make a profit too. Still, you aren?t going to get the metals out on your own, nor would you want to. It?s much easier to take it to the recycler and let them do the work while throwing a little money your way. "
What Catalytic Converters Have the Most Platinum?	"There are some vehicles that are known for having an excessive amount of platinum in the cat construction, which is why the converters are often the target of theft. High-performance cars often make up the ones that are worth the most. As an example, you will get the top price for your Ferrari F430 or Lamborghini Aventador catalytic converter. However, there are a lot of precious metals in other models that don?t cost this much to drive. You will get a decent amount for your hybrid converter or the Ford Mustang?s cat. Trucks are also on the higher end, with the Super Duty models costing far more. If you know that your vehicle type has an expensive catalytic converter installed, you should be proactive and work towards preventing theft. "
How to Protect Catalytic Converter from Being Stolen ?	"You don?t want to spend the money that comes with putting on a new catalytic converter. This can be one of the most expensive fixes you ever deal with on your vehicle, not because of the labor cost but because of the component itself. For this reason, it makes more sense to prevent catalytic converter theft from occurring upfront.Here are a few tips to keep your car protected.Know what cars are targeted. It?s important to know if thieves are after your catalytic converter. In general, many trucks, SUVs and hybrids top the list. You also have to worry about theft if you drive an expensive, luxury car. Etch the VIN on your catalytic converter. If a scrap dealer receives this catalytic converter, they might be more apt to reach out to authorities before paying for it. You may also consider painting the catalytic converter. Most thieves won?t want to deal with this identification and police departments often recommend the practice.Be mindful of where you park. If you are in a public place, park where there?s plenty of light and traffic. At home, you should attempt to park in a garage or at least somewhere that you can monitor the vehicle closely. Install an alarm on the vehicle. Consider setting the sensitivity so people can?t get close to the vehicle without it going off. This could be annoying, especially if you park in busy areas, so use your judgment accordingly.Provide more security at home. Install cameras in the area and motion-activated lights that help you notice when there?s a problem. None of these steps require a lot of effort to follow through on. When you factor in the time spent preventing catalytic converter theft versus the cost to replace it, you see how valuable these practices can be."
How much gold is in a catalytic converter?	"There is no gold in catalytic converters. Platinum, Rhodium, and Palladium are the precious metal that you will find in a catalytic converter, which can be sold for high prices."
How Much Rhodium Is In A Catalytic Converter?	"A catalytic converter usually contains 1 to 2 grams (0.03-0.07 ounces) of rhodium, but it depends on the type of catalytic converter. The price of rhodium can vary greatly depending on market conditions, but it generally has a very high value."
How Much Palladium Is In A Catalytic Converter?	"You will find 2 to 7 grams (0.07-0.25 ounces) of palladium in a catalytic converter, depending on which type of catalytic converter it is. The price of the catalyst will vary depending on how much of the precious metals palladium, platinum and rhodium it contains."
Can I sell just the inside of a catalytic converter?	"Even if the precious metals that scrap yards are interested in are found in the inner part of the catalytic converter, it can cause problems for them to identify it. If they can?t identify the catalytic converter, they may not be able to pay you that much money, so you will most likely get paid more by selling the whole catalytic converter."
What is a Catalytic Converter Delete?	"To perform a catalytic converter delete, you must remove or uninstall the catalytic converter from your vehicle. You can do this yourself in your home garage or you can take it to a professional to be completed. The catalytic converter delete will add more horsepower and create more noise. It also reduces engine temperature and allows for better fuel economy. However, it?s illegal, can cause the Check Engine Light to come on and will make it impossible to pass an emissions test. In some cases, people choose to remove the catalytic converter without doing anything extra. Otherwise, the part can be replaced with a straight pipe. "
Pros of Catalytic Converter Delete 	"1. Boost in HorsepowerBy taking the converter off of your vehicle, you can quickly increase the horsepower. By taking off the catalytic converter, the exhaust gas can exit faster, leading to less engine backpressure.By creating more airflow space, a better mixture can get into the combustion chamber. As combustion happens faster, more power is produced. 2. Lower Engine TemperatureThe same is true about the engine temperature without a catalytic converter. As the engine faces fewer burdens because of the quicker release of gases, more inflow occurs.With more flow of air into the combustion chamber, the engine remains more optimized. Therefore, the operating temperatures drop significantly. 3. Better Fuel EconomyTaking off the converter is going to create better fuel economy for the same reasons we?ve already explained. With a reduction of engine backpressure and a lower temperature, the vehicle runs more efficiently. As the burden on the motor is lessened, it will need fewer fill-ups. This is a good consequence to face, especially in light of higher gas bills. 4. Fuel FlexibilityTo properly take care of the catalytic converter, you need to use a certain unleaded fuel. Otherwise, the lead-based fuel could create internal damage to the catalyst material. However, when you remove the catalytic converter, there?s the option to use other fuels. You can upgrade to something geared for high-performance instead, such as leaded racing fuel. Just make sure that you only use fuels approved by the manufacturer. 5. Louder SoundWith the modern vehicle, the catalytic converter helps to muffle some of the exhaust sounds. It helps to reduce the way the gases impact the engine as they leave the combustion chamber and exit the vehicle.With the catalytic converter removed, the sound coming from your vehicle becomes louder. However, this can also be seen as a con, which is why we?ve included it below as well. 6. Can Be Done at HomeIf you are a home mechanic, you should be able to get the catalytic converter off on your own. To get the converter off, you need to remove the oxygen sensor first. If you don?t have the right wrench, you may be able to borrow it from the auto parts store.From here, you must take the catalytic converter off. Unbolt it and slide it off of the exhaust pipe. If it?s welded, you may need to saw it off. You can also install a straight pipe after taking it off. "
Cons of Catalytic Converter Delete	"1. IllegalRemoving the catalytic converter is illegal. Because of EPA regulations, you can receive tickets and costly fines for taking off the cat.Even if you aren?t taking your car for an inspection, you could still face trouble. The police have the right to pull you over and fine you. 2. Increased EmissionsThe catalytic converter protects the atmosphere from dangerous toxic exhaust gases. It?s meant to convert the gases into something less harmful.When the catalytic converter is taken off, the vehicle pumps all of these toxins into the air. You are only further contributing to damaging the environment at this point.3. Failed Emissions TestWith the catalytic converter off and these gases hitting the air, you are going to have trouble passing your state?s emissions testing. While it?s not required everywhere, most people have to deal with this aspect on a yearly or bi-annual basis.You aren?t allowed to legally drive on the road with a failed emissions test. For this reason, you could face costly fines. 4. More NoiseOnce the noise of the car reaches a certain level, it can be considered noise pollution. This excessive noise can be damaging to your ears. Additionally, you might be disturbing others in the neighborhood. If the noise is higher than a certain decibel rating, you can also receive a ticket for disturbing the peace. 5. Check Engine LightAny interference to engine operations can cause a malfunction with the sensors. When you remove the catalytic converter, you may see the Check Engine Light come on. Some cars have a workaround, allowing you to fit a spacer into the downstream oxygen sensor. This lambda sensor can cause the system to read normally, so the Check Engine Light doesn?t come on. However, this doesn?t change the fact that the system isn?t running as it should. 6. Additional CostWhile you can perform the catalytic converter delete at home, you still have the costs to deal with. Even doing the job at home could cost you $50. If you choose to have a professional help you, the cost could be $300 or more. You can expect to pay a higher bill if the cat needs to be sawed off. "
Is It Legal to Remove the Catalytic Converter?	"It is not legal in any state to run the vehicle without the catalytic converter. You want to reference the laws in your state to find out what you can legally do with the emissions system, but regulations continue to get stricter. For example, no state is quite as strict as California. In this state, you can?t even install exhaust parts that lack the state?s certification. The easiest solution to these problems is to keep your vehicle as it was from the factory. "
Can I Drive Without a Catalytic Converter?	"The short answer is yes. It?s completely possible to physically drive your vehicle without a catalytic converter. Overall, you won?t notice a massive change in the performance of your vehicle without the catalytic converter, other than the sound you might hear. Let?s discuss the legality of driving without the catalytic converter though. While you can drive without the cat, it?s not legal to do so. States have set laws, along with the EPA, regulating how many emissions are pumped into the atmosphere. If you drive without the cat, you are liable for any fines and consequences of breaking the law."
How Much Does An Exhaust System Replacement Cost?	"On average, you might spend $350 to $1,500 to replace an entire exhaust system. The exhaust manifold can cost $500, while the mufflers and downpipes can cost anywhere from $50 to $200 each. The cost depends solely on your vehicle type, the quality of parts and the labor rate. 1. Exhaust ManifoldAs a critical part of the exhaust system, you can expect to spend the most on this component. The manifold is responsible for taking the toxic gases and sending them away from the car. In some cars, there could be two exhaust manifolds, one placed on either side of the engine.Over time, the manifold can crack. This problem occurs most often when using a cast iron manifold, which is cheaper. The steel manifold holds up to high temperatures better and won?t corrode as easily, but also costs more. On average, you may spend $500 for the exhaust manifold and the labor to install it. The manifold is going to be the most expensive part to replace. Besides the part, you may spend one to four hours on labor, so the rate you pay can make a big difference. However, it is luckily not very common that the exhaust manifold will go bad and you are most of the time fine to replace the exhaust parts after it.2. DownpipeThe downpipe is responsible for connecting the exhaust with the turbocharger so fumes can be directed away from the engine. It?s also where the catalytic converter is found. When the gases reach the catalytic converter, emissions are changed from toxic to less harmful. We didn?t deal with the catalytic converter in this replacement guide because it only needs to be replaced when it fails.To replace the downpipe, you may spend $50 to $200, depending on if you need someone to install it for you. The majority of downpipes are made from stainless steel, which allows you to avoid corrosion. If the rings and clamps aren?t included with your downpipe installation, you may have to spend extra. However, these shouldn?t cost you more than another $25 to $50. 3. MufflerThe muffler is needed to reduce the noise that comes out of the engine. With a steel design, it can effectively absorb noise coming from the motor?s combustion. Noise is redirected from the motor to keep the vehicle running as quietly as possible. In general, you might spend $50 to $200 for a new muffler. If you prefer a high-performance muffler, the price can quickly go higher. Plus, you will need to spend an hour or two on labor charges if you aren?t able to put the muffler on yourself. "
what are the Factors Affecting Exhaust System Replacement Cost ?	"1. Make/Model of CarThe biggest factor is going to be what kind of vehicle you drive. Those who drive small, economical cars are going to have the lowest possible price on the exhaust system. If you drive a luxury car, the parts are naturally going to cost more. There will also be high-performance cars that require better exhaust systems to work properly. These cars can also be more time-consuming to work on, thereby increasing the labor bill. 2. OEM vs. AftermarketAs you shop for new exhaust parts, you?ll see the option to choose OEM or aftermarket parts. OEM parts mean they are the original equipment manufacturers, while aftermarket parts can be constructed by anyone. These third-party manufacturers don?t usually have approval from the original automaker, but it?s possible that they do.OEM parts are going to cost you significantly more. However, the quality of these parts is comparable to what was installed on the car from the factory. For this reason, many people prefer to stick to OEM parts to ensure the highest performance level. You can also put these parts on without voiding the car?s warranty.You could choose aftermarket parts if you are looking for a way to save some cash. You just have to be sure you choose something made to fit your vehicle and parts that come from a reputable brand. Taking the time to do your research can help you avoid problems later.3. Exhaust System TypeOn your vehicle, you are dealing with one of two types of exhaust systems in most cases. You might have an axle-back system or a cat-back. While they are similar in how they operate, it?s what parts are included that changes the cost. The axle-back system gets installed after the axle with a muffler, tailpipe and exhaust tips. However, the cat-back system is attached to the catalytic converter. On average, you will spend more to replace the cat-back exhaust than you might with an axle-back. 4. MaterialsYou have options when you choose the materials that create your car?s exhaust. While you will spend more to get an exhaust made from stainless steel, these are more durable and will last longer.On the other hand, there are times when you need to save money on the exhaust. In this case, you can choose mild steel, which reduces the cost but still resists some corrosion. 5. Labor RateIf you can replace your exhaust on your own, there?s a lot of money to be saved. You only need some basic tools to replace an exhaust in most situations.If you aren?t able to replace the exhaust, you need to pay a professional. Depending on your car, this professional could be high-priced, especially if you have a luxury car. The labor rate also significantly changes depending on where you live. If you are in a major city, your mechanic?s labor rate could be double that of a comparable mechanic in the country. "
Do I Need to Replace the Entire Exhaust System?	"There?s a lot of money wrapped up in the exhaust system replacement. If you don?t need to replace it all, it?s best to avoid that, especially when money is tight. The only time you would need to replace the whole exhaust is when the damage is widespread. The exhaust system is prone to warping, especially if the materials are sub-par. If the car is older, it?s very possible that everything needs to go because of wear and tear. Otherwise, you would do better to replace one part at a time. While the job is easier to do at once while things are already apart, you can spend less on the parts by taking your time. However, you could take a piece off and find it doesn?t fit with the rest of the exhaust because of warping. In this situation, you would be back to replacing multiple components at once."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Turbocharger ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad turbocharger are low engine performance, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell. You may also notice reduced fuel economy and a check engine light on your car?s dashboard.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or failing turbocharger to look for:1. Power ReductionThe main purpose of the turbocharger is to provide power to the engine. When the turbocharger begins to fail, you will notice a drop in power and acceleration. You may notice a small loss of power at first, but a blown turbo is going to create a massive drop. While the power aspect of the car will be affected, there shouldn?t be any other handling issue. The turbocharger has no control over steering or braking. If these conditions are occurring in conjunction with the power loss, there could be something else wrong. 2. Burning/Leaking OilAs the turbocharger fails, there?s going to be oil leaking from the system. The turbo needs oil to run, just like the engine. However, a worn turbo can have a cracked gasket or seal. Additionally, the turbo can crack, causing an oil leak. Oil that leaks from the turbo will be burned. This dripping oil might not be noticeable with a visual inspection, but it can be burned up through the exhaust system, leading to an excessive amount of smoke. 3. Excessive Exhaust SmokeWith more oil making its way into the exhaust, you can expect more smoke, as we just touched on. This smoke might appear grey or blue, whereas normal exhaust doesn?t generally have a color. There could also be a strange smell coming from the exhaust smoke. However, there are plenty of mechanical failures that can cause exhaust smoke, many of which don?t have to do with the turbocharger. A blown head gasket, a leaking valve seals or internal engine failure are all causes of smoke too.4. Change in SoundThe turbocharger is going to make some level of noise with regular operation. The noise should be faint and barely noticeable. You may hear a soft whistling sound as the turbo starts up or a whooshing noise. If the sound starts to change, you may be looking at a turbocharger problem. If it begins humming or rattling, there?s something wrong. You want to have it looked at before the problem grows. 5. Reduced Fuel EconomyWhen the engine is optimized and running as it should, you should be able to get the normal amount of fuel economy out of it. However, any time that the engine is running roughly or is failing in some fashion, the fuel economy is going to drop. The same is true when the turbocharger starts to go bad. With the failing turbo, air can?t pass through efficiently as it was designed to. The exiting exhaust also won?t power the turbo the way it should. Because of this, you will notice a drop in the fuel economy numbers. 6. Check Engine LightThere are countless reasons why the Check Engine Light will come on. Still, if you are noticing other bad turbocharger symptoms when the light comes on, you can put two and two together. With your code scanner, you can pinpoint the exact problem. If you notice anything other than turbo codes, you want to fix those first to ensure that you don?t replace unnecessary parts. 7. Incorrect Boost ReadingYou may not have a boost gauge in your car. These are aftermarket parts that generally get added to sportier vehicles. However, if you have one, it?s going to give you a lot of information about the turbo boost function.If the gauge shows that the boost isn?t holding or building correctly, you know there?s a problem. For this reason alone, it might be worthwhile installing a gauge if you don?t already have one. "
what is the Turbocharger Function ?	"The turbocharger is a part that works in conjunction with the engine. It uses exhaust gases to spin the turbine so it can suck air into the intake. The turbocharger sends compressed air from the intake side directly into the motor, where it can create additional power. This process is known as forced induction. Power can be measured by the amount of compressed air being pumped into the engine. The more air, the more power you can expect. "
where the Turbocharger Location ?	"The turbocharger gets bolted directly to the exhaust manifold in most cases, which is on the engine. The exhaust coming from the engine will cause the turbine to spin.This turbine is connected to the compressor with a shaft. This compressor is found between the intake manifold and the air filter. "
what is the Turbocharger Replacement Cost ?	"The cost to replace a bad turbocharger can range anywhere from $1,000 to $4,500. Several factors that influence the cost include the size of the vehicle and the cost of labor. A few models are much easier to work with than others.If the mechanic has to remove many parts to get to the turbocharger, you are going to pay more for the repairs.In general, a stock turbocharger should last the lifetime of the vehicle. With good maintenance, you should be able to get 100,000 to 150,000 miles out of the turbocharger without any trouble. "
how to make Turbocharger Testing ?	"As you can see, there are many different symptoms of a bad turbocharger that can occur in your vehicle. If you experience any of these symptoms above, it is important to take your car to a professional mechanic as soon as possible for repair. These problems will only get worse over time and can eventually lead to severe engine failure and expensive repair costs."
Can I Drive With a Bad Turbocharger?	"While we suggest you never drive with a bad turbocharger; Yes, it is still possible to drive your vehicle when the turbo is damaged or blown. Still, that does not mean you want to keep driving. If the turbo impeller gets damaged it will get sucked into the engine and this can cause serious engine damage.The longer you drive with a blown turbo, the higher the chances are that the engine will need repairs. It?s already going to be expensive enough to fix the turbocharger, you don?t need to add engine repair into that bill. While you drive, you are also going to notice a drop in power. That?s another reason we recommend that you cease driving once you notice there?s a problem and you take the vehicle to your mechanic."
Conclusion	"As you can see, there are many different symptoms of a bad turbocharger that can occur in your vehicle. If you experience any of these symptoms above, it is important to take your car to a professional mechanic as soon as possible for repair. These problems will only get worse over time and can eventually lead to severe engine failure and expensive repair costs."
Do All Cars Have Catalytic Converters?	"All road-legal cars after 1975 with a combustion engine must have a catalytic converter to meet the regulations of the Clean Air Act, determined by the Environmental Protection Agency. Today, any combustion engine car must have a catalytic converter to reduce emissions.Fuel-injected motors emit dangerous gases, such as nitrogen dioxide, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. If these contaminants were pushed out unaltered through the exhaust system, they would cause more damage to the environment. Thankfully, with the help of catalytic converters, these gases are converted into nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor, which are much safer for the atmosphere.Any modern vehicle with a gas or diesel engine will have at least one catalytic converter. A hybrid car will also have a catalytic converter because it works with a traditional engine. On the other hand, the electric car isn?t going to use a catalytic converter because there are no emissions. Additionally, vehicles manufactured before the 1975 regulation probably won?t have a catalytic converter either. "
Why is the Catalytic Converter Necessary?	"The catalytic converter?s main goal is to convert the dangerous emissions coming from the exhaust into gases that aren?t going to harm the environment. Both gas and diesel engines use catalytic converters, although the operation is slightly different between the two. The catalytic converter is required by federal regulations. It?s against the law to drive a modern vehicle with the catalytic converter taken off. When the car is properly cared for, the catalytic converter will last for the lifetime of the vehicle. However, skipping engine maintenance can lead to premature failure. "
Why Does a Car Have More Than One Catalytic Converter?	"are times when you?ll see two catalytic converters on a car. Because the cat works with the exhaust pipe, dual exhaust vehicles will usually have two converters.Still, this isn?t always the case. There are times when exhaust pipes aren?t functional but are in place to look good. For this reason, there might be a differing number of exhaust pipes and catalytic converters. Another reason that the car might have multiple cats is to ensure emission regulations are met. In some cases, the exhaust must be converted two times to ensure clean emissions. "
Can a Car Run Without a Catalytic Converter?	"Mechanically speaking, the car will continue to run and drive without the catalytic converter installed. Without it in place, the car will be extremely noisy and you are allowing more damage to the environment.On some modern cars, there are safety checks in place that keep the car from running right without a catalytic converter. You could notice some performance issues, along with a Check Engine Light if you attempt to drive. However, from a legal standpoint, you should never operate a vehicle without a catalytic converter. You are breaking the law by driving a car without it and your vehicle doesn?t meet emission standards. Local authorities could pull you over and give you a ticket. The exception to these rules is the classic car. Manufacturers weren?t required to use catalytic converters before 1975. For this reason, your classic car can be driven legally without a cat. You won?t need to worry about pricey fines simply for hitting the road. "
Why are Catalytic Converters Valuable?	"Catalytic converter theft continues to rise. With modern security systems, it can be more difficult for thieves to take the cat, but that hasn?t stopped them from trying. So, why are they so interested in catalytic converters and why do they take the time to remove them? For starters, it doesn?t take a long time to remove the cat if you are trying to do it the right way. To properly take off the catalytic converter, one would remove the underpinnings that are holding it in place. However, it?s much faster to saw it off with a pipe saw, which is what most thieves choose to do.For this reason, trucks, SUVs, minivans and other vehicles that have extra ground clearance seem to be the largest target. Other targets include vehicles that knowingly have expensive cats installed. The catalytic converter is made with precious metals inside. Most catalytic converters contain rhodium, palladium and platinum, all of which are worthwhile to turn in at the recycling yard. The more of these metals that are included, the higher the value of the cat becomes. While these values fluctuate frequently, they are always on the higher side. While some catalytic converters may only bring in $50 at the recycling yard, there are some worth $1,200 or more. Educated thieves know which ones to target and they make a quick payout for a few minutes of work. "
How to Protect Your Catalytic Converter ?	"It?s very expensive to replace the catalytic converter and necessary if you want to keep driving your vehicle. Instead of worrying about getting a new one, it?s smarter to protect the cat that?s currently on your vehicle. Here are a few tips to help you protect that cat.Park Smart: Make sure your car is always in a well-lit, busy area. You can also park the exhaust close to a wall, making it harder for people to get underneath. If all else fails, park the cat right over a muddy puddle.Use deterrents: There is equipment you can install over the catalytic converter to keep it safe. These cages and bars don?t cost much to install but can save you a lot of money because you won?t have to replace the cat. You might also use a security alarm that goes off if the vehicle is touched. Depending on how old your vehicle is, the damage caused by having the catalytic converter stolen might be more than the car is worth. For this reason, it?s imperative that you protect it at all costs. "
How to Look Up Catalytic Converter Scrap Value by Serial Number ?	"The best way to find the scrap value of your catalytic converters by serial number is to use a phone app or an online web application. ConverterDatabase or Eco Cat are two of the most popular databases for finding the scrap value.Here are the methods of how to look up your catalytic converter?s scrap value by serial number:1. Find the Serial NumberBefore you can look up the value of your catalytic converter, you first need the serial number. However, not all cats have a serial number on them. The EPA requires that all newer cars have a catalytic converter, but the manufacturers aren?t required to put a serial number on it.If it does have one, it can be difficult to find. To help you out, we have a more in-depth section below showing you where you might find the serial number. You are looking for an etching that is a combination of letters and/or numbers of a varying length.2. Use Online Platform/AppWith the serial number in hand, you can enter the information into an online database to get its estimated value. If you want to look online, try out ConverterDatabase. This database gives the current value of rhodium, palladium and platinum. You can also use a phone app. Many people choose to use Eco Cat, but there are plenty to pick from. There?s a monthly subscription option or you can choose the one free search a day option. 3. Look Up Value with PictureIf you are having trouble getting the serial number or you don?t want to deal with it, you can take a picture with an app. Eco Cat offers this option. Download the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play. Once you upload the photo, you will get a quick quote back on the worth. "
where is the Location of Catalytic Converter Serial Number ?	"The catalytic converter serial number is often stamped or engraved directly into the metal on the converter?s body, but it depends on the car model. It can also be located on a small plate that is welded onto the converter body.Here are some ways to find the catalytic converter serial number by car model:1. GMGeneral Motors labels most catalytic converters the same way across the entire lineup, whether you have a Chevy, GMC or Cadillac. In most cases, the plate will show eight numbers, which is the serial code.However, it could also be just a few numbers, starting with ?GM.? In this case, it would look something like this: GM 115.2. Chrysler/DodgeChrysler and Dodge don?t follow a uniform pattern of labeling catalytic converters. However, you should be able to find it stamped by the cat?s edging. In some cases, it is longer, such as CLLC524AEB. Other times, it might be something simple, such as 8H.3. Subaru Subaru usually has two units located on the downpipe. You can find the serial number listed on the cat?s body. It will be listed in five characters. Typically, it looks something like: OFCA 2. 4. FordFord typically labels the catalytic converter with a longer serial number. You should find a 10-12 digit code on the cat.These characters can be a mix of numbers and letters separated by a hyphen. It should look something like this: 3T51-4W133-CB.5. HyundaiHyundai and Kia are part of the same automaker, so you can expect that the catalytic converters are labeled the same. With both brands, there should be a serial number on the cat.Most cat serial numbers are between three and ten characters. However, these can be a mixture of numbers and letters, such as ABC or PTEE 12.6. VolkswagenVolkswagen has a unique way of labeling catalytic converters. You can often find a mixture of nine numbers, along with one to three letters, all separated by spaces.For example, the serial number could read 824 313 901 H. Otherwise, it might appear as a mixture, such as 5J1 242 908 G. 7. Aftermarket CatsIf you have a car with a modified exhaust, the catalytic converter might have been removed. While it is against the law not to have a cat, there are other options that can be used in its place. If you install an aftermarket exhaust, it will provide more airflow and a boost to performance. The new converter should be labeled with some type of serial number, but it probably won?t follow the guidelines of most OEM cats. \"
What Affects Catalytic Converter Value?	"The type of catalytic converter you have is going to have the biggest impact on the price. The composition of rare metals has the potential to drive the price higher. If you have a converter that is filled with pricey materials, you are going to get a higher price.The price is changed based on the current market value of precious metals. For example, when this article was written, the following values were given to precious metals:Platinum: $923/ouncePalladium: $1911/ounceRhodium: $14500/ounceAs with any commodity and rare metal, prices are sure to change frequently. That?s why it?s important to check the value before you turn in your catalytic converter. In some markets, it?s best to hold it a little longer, as a small difference in value can make a huge difference with what you will earn for salvaging the metal. However, the condition of the catalytic converter is also important. It?s only going to get the top price if it?s still in good working condition. If it?s chipped or broken, the value will drop.It also matters where you sell the catalytic converter. Some parts of the country pay more for the cats than others. "
what is the Highest Catalytic Converter Values ?	"There are some vehicles that are specifically known for having higher catalytic converter values. Here are a few that bring in top dollar, on average.Ferrari F430: $3,500Lamborghini Aventador: $3,200 each (contains 2)RAM 2500: $3,500Ford F-250: $2,750Ford Mustang: $1,500If you have one of these cars, your catalytic converter is at risk. It is more of a target for catalytic converter theft than others. Seeing what these catalytic converters are worth for scrap, you can only imagine what these will cost to replace. "
what is the Average Catalytic Converter Values ?	"According to RRCats.com, here are a few of the most common average catalytic converter scrap values. Small GM: $89-$123Small Domestic: $58-$195Small Foreign: $87-$198Regular Domestic: $59-$245Medium Foreign: $139-$345Large GM: $174-$345Large Foreign: $208-$492Diesel: $18-$595Aftermarket: $20Exotic: $543-$1095To get a more accurate quote, you will need to get information related to your specific catalytic converter. You can try multiple platforms to see if one company is willing to offer more than another. If you don?t feel like transporting it or dealing with the hassle, you can also post it online for scrap metal and someone will surely pick it while giving you a portion of the money. "
how to Preparing my Catalytic Converter for Scrap ?	"1. Cut Off Exhaust PipesOn both ends of the catalytic converter, you have the exhaust pipes. You want to cut these off, as close to the shell as you can. You should be able to use a sawzall to get through the material. If you leave it on, the yard will have to cut it and might charge you for labor.2. Leave the Honeycomb InAs you peer into the catalytic converter, you will see a honeycomb structure. This mesh-like part is responsible for filtering the exhaust fumes. This is where precious metals are located to create a catalytic reaction.If you remove the honeycomb from the catalytic converter, you are essentially taking out the precious metals that give you the most value. You need to keep this intact if you want to get the maximum value. However, many novice scrapers will inadvertently remove this part thinking it is worthless."
Which catalytic converters bring the highest scrap price?	"Generally, catalysts with a lot of the precious metals palladium and rhodium bring the highest scrap price. Ferrari F430, Dodge RAM 2500 and Ford 250 are some examples of cars with expensive catalytic converters."
How do I find my catalytic converter serial number?	"To find the serial number of your catalytic converter, you should look at the catalytic converter itself. Look for a 5 to 12-digit/character serial number. However, on old catalytic converters, this serial number can be difficult to find due to rust. You can also ask your authorized dealer for this information about your vehicle if you cannot find it."
How long is a serial number of a catalytic converter?	"The length of the serial number on a catalytic converter varies depending on the car model it is found on. However, you will usually find a serial number of 5 to 12 digits and/or characters that can be used to identify your catalytic converter."
How many serial numbers are on a catalytic converter?	"Typically, catalytic converters should have one 5 to 12-digit/character serial number that is used to determine its value and identification. However, on old catalytic converters, this number can be difficult to find due to rust and age."
Can I Drive Without a Catalytic Converter?	"There?s nothing mechanically stopping you from driving without the catalytic converter. Your car will continue to run, although there will be some new sounds and performance issues. On the other hand, it?s not legal to drive without a catalytic converter, so it?s not always advisable. The catalytic converter is required by all states to reduce air pollution from your vehicle. While you probably won?t harm the vehicle by driving without it, you are causing more damage to the environment. For this reason alone, you don?t want to drive for long periods without it. Your best bet is to have it replaced immediately. "
Consequences of Driving Without a Catalytic Converter ?	"1. Loud Exhaust SoundMost people realize that the catalytic converter has been stolen when they go to start the vehicle. Immediately, you will hear a loud exhaust sound coming from the vehicle.The car sounds like it?s roaring instead of purring softly. If you step on the gas, you will notice the increased sound even more. There?s simply no denying the sound a car makes without its catalytic converter. It?s also sure to turn a lot of heads as you travel down the road. 2. Rough PerformanceWithout every part of the exhaust system in place, the engine can start to run roughly. The Check Engine Light should illuminate on the dash. When this component isn?t in place, the computer will not be able to read the oxygen in the exhaust properly and will lead to engine performance issues. The performance change won?t be as dramatic as if there was a misfire, but you should notice it. Of course, you will already know what?s causing it because of the sound, so you won?t be wondering what?s going on. 3. Inspection/Emissions FailureIt?s required in every state to have a catalytic converter on your vehicle. If you attempt to go for a yearly inspection, it?s quite possible that the mechanic will fail your vehicle. While there are many aspects of the inspection that are important, having an intact exhaust is one of the top checks. Not only does your vehicle need a working catalytic converter, but most states also check the exhaust pipe, muffler and other parts.Additionally, the catalytic converter is required to convert dangerous toxins into byproducts that aren?t as harmful. What is a harmful emission quickly turns into carbon dioxide and water vapor once the chemical reaction occurs. If you don?t have a catalytic converter in place, you won?t be able to filter out the emissions and this chemical reaction can?t take place. When you take the vehicle for an emissions test, the car is going to fail. Because it contributes to polluted air quality, you will be responsible for having the converter replaced before it can get a passing grade. 4. Police FineIf you had a catalytic converter stolen, it?s your responsibility to have it replaced in a reasonable timeframe. The good news is that most police departments understand the popularity of catalytic converter theft. It?s important that you report the theft as soon as you realize it?s occurred. Not only will this help to stop the thieves in the future, but it puts on record that yours was stolen, buying you a little bit of time.Most police aren?t going to bother you if your catalytic converter was stolen. However, if you choose to remove the converter, you could be liable for a fine. It?s illegal in every state to tamper with the emissions control system if it causes failure. The amount you will pay for this fine depends on what state you are in and how many previous tickets you?ve received for the same issue. In the end, it?s best to put the catalytic converter back on and avoid this unnecessary cost. "
how to Prevent Catalytic Converter Theft ?	"1. Install Protective GearWith so many catalytic converters being stolen each year, there?s a market for protective devices. You can have one of these devices installed, making it more difficult for the catalytic converter to be stolen. However, most people don?t take this step until the catalytic converter has first been stolen and they need to protect the new one. There are varying degrees of protection available, each at a different price point.In general, you might spend $200 to $500 for the device and installation, but this is a fraction of the cost when the catalytic converter needs to be replaced. Most people opt for some type of shield, but there are also straps and other types of gear available. 2. Park WiselyBy thinking ahead, you can save yourself a lot of headaches. Obviously, the best place to put your vehicle is in the garage at the end of a long day. However, this isn?t always possible, especially if you don?t own a garage or you are out and about. In those situations, consider these smarter parking options.Stick to areas with lots of light. If it?s nighttime, park under bright lights or near street lights.Park where people are. If you have to choose a parking garage or lot, don?t park where there are no other cars. While this is a good practice to keep the vehicle from damage, it can make your car a target to thieves. You want an area with a lot of foot traffic, showing thieves that they won?t easily get away with any shenanigans. Park near security cameras. If you can find security cameras looking over the parking spot, try to be within range of it. Thieves are sure to look around and see where they can get away with a crime without being caught, so security cameras are bound to deter them. With all of these practices together, you stand a better chance of keeping your catalytic converter safe, along with the vehicle itself and all of the possessions inside. At the very least, if something is stolen, you have a better chance of recovering it between the cameras and possible eye-witnesses. 3. Use an AlarmYou can equip your car with a security alarm to help prevent catalytic converter theft. Just keep in mind that not every alarm is going to work for this situation. Some don?t go off unless the car is physically broken into.For this reason, you want a car alarm that registers vibrations. If someone is moving the car around while sawing off the catalytic converter, the alarm will trigger and you could potentially catch the act in progress. At the least, you will give the thieves a major scare and get them scattering."
What is the Resonator Delete?	"The resonator delete is a popular car modification that alters the flow of exhaust pulses moving through the system. During a resonator delete, the resonator part is completely removed.A resonator delete alters the exhaust sound and removes weight from the vehicle. It?s usually a legal modification, requiring minimal maintenance with no big changes to the muffler. However, it can create droning sounds, reduce flow, impair engine efficiency, turn on the Check Engine Light, and may void the warranty.A resonator delete isn?t the same as a muffler delete, which involves taking off the muffler instead. However, both options have many of the same benefits and disadvantages. Some people also choose to remove the resonator and muffler to replace the system with a straight pipe exhaust instead. "
Resonator Delete Pros ?	"1. Changes Sound ProfileWith the resonator off, you will notice a deeper sound. It becomes more authentic, giving it a completely unique exhaust note.While the resonator delete won?t alter the sound in a profound way, it is noticeable. However, the larger the muffler is, the less you might notice. 2. Reduces WeightAny time you can remove weight from your vehicle, you are increasing performance. When you remove a part, your car is also getting a weight loss.Each exhaust resonator might weigh around twenty pounds, so you are taking off about forty if your vehicle has two. While this might not seem like a big change, every pound counts when performance matters.3. Usually Legal ModificationIn most states, it?s legal to modify the exhaust after the catalytic converter. On the other hand, anything that occurs before the cat is not legal. As long as you aren?t changing the emissions profile of your vehicle, most states don?t care if you take the resonator off. However, you should do your own research, because there are a few states that don?t allow any modifications to the exhaust system. 4. Requires Minimal MaintenanceAfter the resonator delete is completed, you don?t need to do anything else. You won?t need to repair or inspect anything after the job. For the most part, there shouldn?t be any performance issues either. The only trouble you might encounter is a Check Engine Light with a newer vehicle, but we will touch more on that in a minute. 5. Keeps Your Muffler IntactWhen you take off the resonator, you don?t need to do anything with the muffler. Even if you have a dual exhaust, you don?t need to make any modifications.In some cases, you may need a Y pipe at the end of the exhaust to keep things running properly. With this setup, you will get a deeper note that is pleasing. "
Resonator Delete Cons ?	"1. Droning SoundsThe resonator is responsible for removing the droning sounds that occur when driving at higher speeds for longer distances. This sound is more noticeable at 3,000 to 4,000 RPMs. With the resonator off, the drone and hum sounds are more prevalent. You could also hear some rattling or screeching sounds at certain RPMs, although they shouldn?t be too bothersome. 2. Lose Some EfficiencyThe resonator is meant to create the most efficient exhaust possible. With it intact, fuel efficiency is optimized. With the resonator delete, you could see a small drop of efficiency. This situation is caused by an engine that must work harder to produce the same amount of horsepower. However, the impact is so minor, that it could be completely unnoticed at all. 3. Reduce Exhaust Flow SpeedIn the modern vehicle, pistons are used to push the exhaust gas out of the chamber so it can fill back up with fresh fuel and air. The resonator is needed to add extra force to this process, helping the gases move faster. With a resonator, the sound waves help to evacuate the chamber, making room for more fuel and air.The stronger the waves are, the better the vacuum pressure is. When you take the resonator off, you lose these sound waves, thereby creating less pressure. As a result, the exhaust flow speed is slightly reduced. However, this isn?t normally noticeable by the average driver. 4. Check Engine LightThe resonator is part of the exhaust system, which can be heavily monitored on newer vehicles. When you take the resonator off, it can impact the catalytic converter performance. In some cases, this backpressure change can cause the Check Engine Light to come on. You should be able to read the codes with an OBDII scanner.This shouldn?t cause your vehicle to fail an emissions test because the cat is still in place. However, you could find it annoying driving with the Check Engine Light on. Additionally, it becomes more difficult to know when there truly is an issue if the warning light is constantly illuminated. For this reason alone, some people avoid performing a resonator delete. 5. Voids WarrantyIf you drive a newer vehicle, you may still have a warranty in place. Making changes to the exhaust system could cause the warranty to become void. If you have to pay for repairs out of pocket, you could be looking at a hefty bill, depending on what goes wrong. In most cases, the entire warranty won?t be voided. Legally, automakers are only allowed to deny warranty coverage if the modification directly caused the part failure. Therefore, if your car stereo goes out, the dealership can?t blame the problem on your exhaust modifications. However, if you drive an older car, this isn?t even an issue. It?s unlikely that you still have a car warranty, so you are free to make whatever changes you legally can. "
Resonator Delete Cost ?	"The average cost of professional resonator delete is between $100 and $200, if using aftermarket parts. If welding is required, you might need to spend a little more. Additionally, if you are removing two resonators, the fee could double.However, it?s not difficult to remove a resonator with the right tools and a piece of pipe at home. By doing it yourself, you can save a lot of money. "
How to Do Resonator Delete ?	"1. Jack Up the VehicleYou need to get under the vehicle to perform a resonator delete. The best way to do this is to jack it up for more clearance.Place the jack in an appropriate place and raise the vehicle. Gently place the car on stable jack stands for your security. 2. Find the ResonatorBefore you can move on, you must understand what part you are working with. After lifting the vehicle, you should have no trouble finding the resonator. It?s located after the catalytic converter, although it could be very close. However, it should be found before the muffler. If you are working with two resonators, you want to find both of them before proceeding.3. Cut the PipeBefore you cut any pipes, it?s important to protect yourself. You should put on some hearing protection, safety glasses and gloves. With a saw blade or an angle grinder, you can cut the exhaust pipe before and after the resonator. You can make this cut up to two inches in either direction. If you have two, you will have to perform double the number of cuts. 4. Remove ResonatorOnce these cuts have been made, it should be simple to get the resonator off. You can simply remove it.If the resonator isn?t coming off easily, you might not have cut all the way through. Take another look at your cuts to see where the error is and try again. 5. Weld PipesWith the resonator off, you need to weld the exhaust pipes together. If you don?t have welding experience, it might be best to rely on a professional for this service.Additionally, you can purchase an exhaust clamp kit to hold the two joints together. Take some bolts and fasten it down on either end. "
what are the Symptoms Of A Clogged or Bad DPF Filter ?	"When the DPF filter gets blocked or clogged, the engine becomes weaker and a check engine light often shows on your dashboard. It can also lead to higher fuel consumption and create a hard-starting situation. Additionally, you may also notice strange smells or turbocharger issues.Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or clogged diesel particulate filter (DPF) to look for:1. Check Engine LightThe first, and most common sign of a bad DPF is a check engine light on your dashboard. The diesel particulate filter uses sensors to measure the pressure and temperature before and after the DPF filter. If the pressure is not correct, the engine control module will light up the check engine light on your dashboard.If you see a check engine light on your dashboard, you need to scan the trouble code memory with a code scanner to figure out what?s wrong.2. Decreased Engine PerformanceWhen the DPF is blocked, the exhaust system becomes dramatically affected. The ability to remove the exhaust from the engine efficiently is hindered, causing there to be a backup in the system. With the backup, the engine starts to feel weak and sluggish. The more exhaust gases that build up, the slower new fuel can be pumped in, leaving you without the ability to accelerate normally. Plus, the engine will need to use more power to push out the excess gases. 3. Poor Fuel EfficiencyWith the engine not working efficiently, you will burn more fuel than normal. Part of the inefficiency comes from the blocked filter itself, causing more fuel to be pumped in to accomplish the same task. It?s also caused by the need for more fuel to get the desired results from your engine.With these problems, you are going to spend more money at the pump. As the cost of diesel continues to rise, you are sure to notice the difference. 4. Trouble StartingThe blocked DPF creates a buildup of exhaust gas in the engine. This trapped gas isn?t able to go anywhere, creating more pressure than normal. During this time, it becomes difficult to get the engine cranked over. In fact, the engine won?t want to start unless that pressure gets released. This problem is more of a safety design. If the engine starts with all that pressure inside, permanent damage could occur, leading to major repair bills. To save yourself this money, it?s best to clean the DPF before a blockage occurs. 5. Strange SmellsAs the exhaust gas builds up in the engine, it can lead to a noticeable odor. Not only is this annoying, but it can also be dangerous.Exhaust gases are not safe to breathe and they can be flammable, putting you at risk of a fire. Additionally, while these smells are occurring, it?s difficult to tell if something else is wrong.6. Turbocharger DamageWith a blockage in the exhaust system, you must also consider the health of the turbocharger. When the gas flow is hindered or slowed down, the temperatures can quickly rise. When the problem isn?t resolved promptly, the turbine housing also gets hotter.Left unchecked, the turbocharger becomes damaged. If the housing becomes damaged, leaks can occur and efficiency will drop. This problem can also cause the oil inside the turbocharger to carbonize, which becomes dangerous to the motor itself. "
where the Diesel Particulate Filter Location ?	"The diesel particulate filter (DPF) is part of the exhaust system in your diesel vehicle. You can find the filter sitting ahead of the NOx trap, otherwise known as the NOx storage catalytic converter. You will often find the DPF filter close to the exhaust manifold.It?s also found ahead of the exhaust pipe but will be found behind the first temperature sensor. To remove the filter, you will need a screwdriver to take off the surrounding grills and plates. After the plates are removed, there could also be some O-rings or other clamps to take off. "
what is the Diesel Particulate Filter Function ?	"The diesel particulate filter is part of the exhaust system. It?s meant to trap particulate matter, such as ash and soot. The DPF is constructed with a substrate that is made from ceramic material. It forms a honeycomb structure that is effective at trapping debris.The diesel particulate filter is meant to capture and store the soot from the exhaust, so the diesel vehicle can have reduced emissions. This soot is burned off periodically to help regenerate the DPF. With this regeneration process, excess soot gets burned off and deposited back in the filter, reducing the harmful emissions and black smoke you are used to seeing from diesel models during acceleration. DPFs are now mandatory on all vehicles since 2007, as per EPA guidelines. These filters trap matter so the vehicle can adhere to strict emissions standards. "
what is the Diesel Particulate Filter Replacement Cost ?	"A brand-new diesel particulate filter can cost between $1,000 and $7,000. These new parts are never inexpensive, which is why it?s important to keep the system running properly. Instead of replacing it, most people choose to clean it for more life. Considering that the DPF doesn?t normally fail in a low-mileage vehicle, it makes more sense to clean it. After all, the cost of a new DPF could be more than the value of the vehicle itself. When properly maintained, the DPF shouldn?t need to be cleaned more than every 100,000 miles."
how to make DPF Filter Testing ?	"Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) testing is a crucial process to ensure that the DPF is working properly and efficiently. Here are the steps to perform DPF filter testing:Remove the DPF from the vehicle and inspect it for any visible damage or signs of wear.Use a suitable cleaning agent to clean the DPF thoroughly, removing any built-up soot and debris.Inspect the DPF's ceramic core for any cracks or other signs of damage.Use a pressure gauge to check the DPF's backpressure.Compare the backpressure measurement with the manufacturer's specifications for the particular DPF being tested.Use a flow meter to measure the DPF's air flow.Compare the air flow measurement with the manufacturer's specifications for the particular DPF being tested.Inspect the DPF's temperature sensors and pressure sensors for proper operation.Use a suitable diagnostic tool to check the DPF's regeneration system for proper operation.Replace the DPF or any components that are found to be faulty or outside of the manufacturer's specifications.Reinstall the DPF onto the vehicle and perform a test drive to ensure that it's functioning properly and that there are no issues with the vehicle's performance.Overall, it's important to perform regular DPF filter testing and maintenance to ensure the proper functioning of the vehicle's emissions control system and to avoid any potential issues that may cause damage to the engine."
How to Clean a Diesel Particulate Filter ?	"1. ThermalIf you take the DPF to a professional for cleaning, you might hear them using the thermal method. This cleaning technique is also known as the ?bake and blow.?The DPF is put in an oven. With the heat raised, the soot is oxidized, while the airflow pushes the ash out of the filter. 2. AqueousThis other professional method has been shown to be effective. A surfactant surrounds the ash particles, making it easier for water to wash the debris away from the substrate.Once the substrate is cleaned, it must be dried completely. A special cabinet is needed, so you will have to wait at least two hours before it can be reinstalled. 3. At-Home CleanersIf you don?t want to take your vehicle to a professional for cleaning, you can try and do it yourself with a special additive. You can find some top brands for less than $25 per bottle. These products are meant to break down soot and ash. Follow all of the directions found on the back of the bottle. You will have to put it into the fuel tank with the engine running. Once it has been added, it?s best to drive for thirty minutes. This helps the additive circulate in the system. It doesn?t matter what speed you travel at ? it will work. Plus, the DPF warning light might disappear if it was previously on. While cleaning additives can break up some clogs, they are best used for maintenance. If you are using a cleaner every three to six months, you shouldn?t have any clogging issues down the road. If you are still having trouble after using an additive, you might need one of the professional cleaning methods instead. Visit your local diesel mechanic for more support."
Conclusion	"A clogged DPF filter can cause many problems for your car. If you notice any of the signs mentioned above, it is important to take action and replace or repair your DPF filter as soon as possible. A new DPF filter will help improve your car?s emissions, performance and fuel efficiency."
How is Exhaust Sound Generated?	"What makes the sound that?s coming out of the exhaust? Power is generated when a mixture of fuel and air combusts in the engine. In other words, your engine is creating a constant series of controlled explosions. As this power is created, sound waves travel out of the vehicle through the exhaust system. On the way out of the car, the sound waves and exhaust gases move through several parts, including the catalytic converter, muffler and resonator. Each of these parts changes the sound that is coming out of the vehicle. If you want a more aggressive sound, you must alter the parts in some way. "
How to Make Your Car?s Exhaust Louder (Ranked by Price) ?	"To make your car?s exhaust louder, you can increase the exhaust sound by taking off the muffler. You can also remove the catalytic converter or install a cat-back exhaust. Consider putting on a performance muffler, cold air intake, turbocharger, straight pipe exhaust, or aftermarket exhaust if you have the money. Here is a more detailed list of the different ways to make your car?s exhaust louder by budget.1. Drill Holes in Exhaust ($0-$25)This is the least recommended option, but the cheapest way to create a louder exhaust sound is to drill small holes in the exhaust. This will cause an exhaust leak, creating a louder sound. With your power drill and 3/8? bit, simply put four to six holes in the exhaust pipe. These holes should be drilled before the muffler but after the catalytic converter. If you put it before the cat, you could allow dangerous gases to enter the atmosphere. As the engine releases sound, the waves will make their way through the system, but a few will escape through the holes before they can be quieted through the muffler. However, this method is definitely not recommended over the others, as it can lead to more exhaust fumes in the cabin, which is bad for your health. It can also lead to your car failing a smog test. If you have an annual inspection of the car in your country, that?s going to be a problem2. Take Off Muffler ($20-$45)By taking the muffler off of the exhaust, you remove the part that creates the silencing action. You will need to replace the muffler with a pipe welded into the system. If you find some suitable pipes, you can also use exhaust clamps, although welding is often the best way. You may need to weld mounts for the rubber hangers though.Removing the muffler from the equation substantially changes the way the car sounds, making it louder. This will often also cause a much more aggressive exhaust sound. However, it?s not legal to perform in all US states.READ MORE: Muffler Delete: Pros & Cons (and Average Cost)3. Install Exhaust Tip ($35-$65)The resonator has the opposite effect of the muffler. Instead of bouncing the sound waves around to silence them, the resonator tip is going to vibrate the waves, leading to a slightly different sound, not necessarily much louder. However, not all car models use a resonator, so in this case, it is just called an exhaust tip.It isn?t difficult to install the resonator or exhaust tip. You will clip it to the exhaust system?s tail. You also don?t need a lot of money to get this job done. Unfortunately, this will often not make a big difference to the car?s exhaust sound, but it can make a small difference, it?s easy to install and it will give a better appearance to your car?s look.4. Remove Catalytic Converter ($50-$350)The catalytic converter is used to reduce the hazardous byproduct of the emissions. It also reduces the sound coming from your car.You can bypass this system with the help of a downpipe or a fitting pipe instead of the converter. You will instantly notice a boost in the sound level. However, it?s also normally against the law to do this procedure, so your vehicle might only be good off-road once it is done. It also isn?t going to pass the emissions inspection without the cat.The engine control module also uses O2 sensors to measure catalyst efficiency, and by simply removing the cat, you can get a check engine light on your dashboard and a P0420 code on your scanner. You need to reprogram the ECU to bypass this issue if you choose to remove it.5. Put on Performance Muffler ($65-$150)The performance muffler is going to change the way the sound comes out of the exhaust. While it may still suppress some of the sound waves, it can also increase the overall tone. The performance muffler has fewer plates in the construction and it features a hollow design. With the easy gas exit, not only will the sound be increased, but performance can be boosted. Not all performance mufflers are legal, so check your local laws before installing one. However, it?s often a better choice than removing the muffler completely.5. Install Cold Air Intake ($150-$300)If you want more performance and a slightly tweaked sound, the cold air intake is right for you. With the cold air intake, the engine sucks in cooler air, giving it a better performance because of the added oxygen levels. While nothing changes with the exhaust itself, the sound coming from the engine is louder and more aggressive, which creates a different tone when it exits the exhaust. If your car has a turbocharger, it will also make this cool turbo chirping sound more noticeable when you let off the gas pedal and change gears.6. Install Turbocharger ($400-$3,000)The turbocharger itself does not make your car?s exhaust sound higher, it will actually do the opposite most of the time ? but it will definitely make your car engine sound better. The turbocharger also adds more air to the combustion chamber to boost horsepower and torque. The upgrade won?t change any of the exhaust parts, but the increased performance will create a different overall sound for the vehicle.However, this is a costly upgrade that isn?t worth the expense unless you are looking for a major boost. After you have added the turbocharger, you may also need to replace other parts such as the fuel injectors, and also change the map of the engine control module to work with the higher fuel requirement.7. Install Straight Pipe Exhaust ($450-$1,250)If you are really looking to make your exhaust sound louder ? a lot louder ? a straight pipe exhaust is your best choice. Changing the exhaust to a straight pipe design means you must get rid of multiple exhaust components. You will remove the catalytic converter, resonator and muffler while adding in a straight pipe instead.To make the straight pipe operate correctly, there might be some tuning involved, which can dramatically increase the price. However, by eliminating most of the restriction, you are going to give a whole new sound to the exhaust. 8. Install Aftermarket Exhaust ($250-$1,500)If you are ready to make some big changes and you have the money to invest, it?s best to install a complete aftermarket exhaust system. It?s the perfect way to maximize how much airflow is permitted, allowing for a super loud sound.The standard stock exhaust from the manufacturer is very restrictive, looking to quiet the sound as much as possible. By removing these restrictions, the aftermarket exhaust perfects the way the airflow should be. However, you want to choose something that?s specifically meant for your goals and is designed to work with your vehicle. If you aren?t sure what?s best, you should talk with a professional. You can either choose to replace the entire exhaust pipe from the exhaust manifold with an aftermarket exhaust system, or choose a cat-back exhaust system. Catback exhaust pipes are the most popular choice, and this means that you replace everything from the catalytic converter and back. You can find many cat-back exhausts on the market. They will give your car a louder and deeper sound while still having a functioning cat.The aftermarket exhaust offers another benefit you might not have thought about. Because there are fewer airflow restrictions, the engine performance will also be increased. The engine breathes better, there are fewer blockages, and you will notice a profound difference after the installation. "
Is It Illegal to Make the Exhaust Louder?	"There are plenty of ways to make the exhaust louder that are legal to perform. However, keep in mind that not all of the options I?ve listed above are legal, and performing some of them could land you in hot water depending on what jurisdiction you live in. In particular, if you eliminate any exhaust parts, such as the muffler or catalytic converter, you could end up in trouble. Emission restrictions are very strict, with some states requiring regular inspections.That?s why it?s important to check your local laws and regulations before you make any exhaust modifications. Additionally, if you aren?t sure how to make the modifications, it?s best to have a professional do the job. You don?t want any exhaust gas infiltrating the cabin, which could be dangerous for you and your occupants."
Why Do Thieves Steal Catalytic Converters?	"In many cars, it?s easy to access the catalytic converter. With an angle grinder, it can be quickly removed, requiring only a couple of minutes to accomplish. Inside the catalytic converter are precious and rare minerals that cost a lot of money.Today, palladium continues to cost $2,500 per ounce, and this is just one of the minerals found inside catalytic converters. In fact, this price has skyrocketed right past the value of gold. "
Cars Least Likely to Have Catalytic Converter Stolen ?	"Cars with the catalytic converter installed in the engine compartment are much less likely to have it stolen. Many American and some Asian car brands tend to have less valuable catalysts. You can also buy an electric, diesel, or older car without a catalytic converter installed.1. Certain Brand CarsAmerican brands such as Ford, Chevy, Jeep, Dodge, and Chrysler tend to have less valuable catalytic converters and are therefore less likely to get stolen. Some Nissan, Hyundai, Mazda, and Subaru models also fall into this category.Many brands used cat designs that limit how many precious metals were inside. Thieves tend to do enough research to know to stay away from these brands.2. Cars with Converters in the Engine CompartmentSeveral cars have installed the catalytic converter in the engine compartment instead of further back on the car?s exhaust system. This design makes it much more difficult for a thief to steal it.No thief wants to put in the extra work to get to these cats, so they will move on to a different model. Many car models like Audi, BMW, Honda, and Volkswagen models fall into this category.3. Cars Built Before 1974If you are driving a car that was manufactured before 1974, you don?t need to worry about catalytic converter theft. None of these vehicles have a catalytic converter installed. After that time, the government took action to clean up the emissions. It became mandatory for vehicles to have a catalytic converter. 4. Electric CarsCatalytic converters clean up the gas or diesel fuel emissions. Therefore, there?s no catalytic converter on cars that rely on electric power instead.Because the car isn?t emitting gaseous waste, there?s nothing to clean. Plugging into a power source to charge the battery isn?t going to use any gas or diesel power. Volkswagen e-gold, Audi E-Tron, and Tesla models are some popular choices.5. Diesel VehiclesThe diesel vehicle uses a different type of catalytic converter than gasoline vehicles. Most converter thieves know that these aren?t worth as much as gas catalytic converters.Diesel converters or so-called particle filters aren?t normally constructed with rhodium, palladium, or platinum. Since these are the precious metals that thieves are looking for, they will often move on from diesel vehicles.RELATED: Do Diesel Engines Have Catalytic Converters?6. Cars with Bead ConvertersBead cats are filled with beads. Most expert thieves know which cars contain these catalytic converters because they aren?t worth anything, even though they are larger in size.Chevy was known for using a bead converter. Additionally, some other GM models can be found with this type."
Cars Most Likely to Have Catalytic Converters Stolen ?	"The cars that are most likely to have their catalytic converter stolen are hybrid cars like the Toyota Prius. Trucks and SUVs are also very commonly targeted due to the large engines (valuable catalysts) and the high ground clearance, which provides easy access to the catalytic converter.1. Hybrid CarsIf the vehicle is focused on providing clean emissions, the converter is likely more expensive. To keep the environment cleaner, the automaker will install cats with higher concentrations of palladium. Additionally, because the car already runs cleaner with the help of an electric motor, the cats aren?t used heavily. Of course, this design also adds to a higher price for the car. Toyota Prius is one of those examples that are highly targeted to catalytic converter thefts.2. Trucks & SUVsThere are two reasons that larger SUVs and trucks tend to be targeted. The bigger engine requires a more valuable cat for emissions standards. Additionally, the height of the vehicle makes it easier for thieves to reach the catalytic converter. With less time needed to get the job done and a good payday ahead, these are some of the most targeted vehicles. Ford F-250 and Toyota Tacoma are two great examples of this.3. Luxury CarsMany luxury cars have very valuable catalysts and sometimes more than one per engine due to the V-10 or V12 engines. If you look at the most expensive catalytic converters on the road today, you will see that the Ferrari F430 converter can fetch a price of over $3,500. Plus, this car contains two converters, making it a great payday for the unethical person.Lamborghinis are also known for having expensive catalytic converters. Some of the lineup?s cats can sell for more than $3,000. However, these cars usually have a very low ground clearance and are often parked in a garage, so it?s more difficult for thieves to steal those.4. Older VehiclesIf you get a car that?s a couple of decades old, but was still manufactured after 1974, you are going to see more costly catalytic converters installed. That?s because the overall eco-friendliness of this vehicle wasn?t a top concern. These cars contain larger catalytic converters with a higher level of metals included because of how poor the emissions were. These are going to be more valuable than any off of a newer, more efficient car. "
Ways to Prevent Catalytic Converter Theft ?	"1. Choose Vehicle WiselyBefore you purchase a vehicle, do some research to see how much it is targeted. If you are considering two different models, this could be the deciding factor. This is an important step to consider, especially if you are strapped for cash. If you put out the last of your money to purchase a car, you won?t have the funds to replace the catalytic converter if it gets stolen. 2. Install Anti-Theft DeviceThere are different anti-theft devices you can install to prevent the cats from being stolen. Some people choose the steel shield that makes it harder to remove. There are also steel cages and steel cables that can be attached. Either way, you might spend $200 to $750 to have one of these devices installed. 3. Park WiselyObviously, the best place to park your vehicle is in the garage, where thieves can?t get to it. However, covered parking isn?t always feasible, especially when you are out and about. When you park in a public location, make sure it is busy and well-lit. This step protects your catalytic converter and you car, in general, from any theft or vandalism. 4. Paint the ConverterConsider painting your catalytic converter a unique color. You could use something fluorescent, making the catalytic converter easier to identify.You can also make it less attractive by painting or removing the VIN on the converter. Most thieves know they will have a harder time selling one of these. 5. Install a Car AlarmIf you can adjust the sensitivity of a car alarm, this could be your best defense. Many car alarms will offer settings that go off when people get close to the vehicle.The key here is to ensure you don?t become complacent with how much more the alarm goes off. You will need to continue taking every alarm seriously and check out what?s going on."
conclusion	"Having the right car insurance for your car is important when it comes to catalytic theft. For example, if you have comprehensive coverage, it covers catalytic theft and the cost of a new replacement catalyst. So it is important to check these things before you get insurance for your vehicle if you are worried about catalytic converter thefts."
What is a Muffler Delete?	"A muffler delete refers to removing the muffler(s) from your car?s exhaust system. A muffler serves as a resonator to reduce the noise coming from the engine. Many car models have two or more mufflers on the exhaust system which can be removed as desired.You can also choose to create a straight pipe exhaust system, but that requires removing the muffler and the catalytic converter. While the two services are often talked about as the same procedure, the straight pipe exhaust requires more modifications.As said, many exhaust pipes have two or more mufflers, so which or how many you want to remove is up to you."
Muffler Delete Pros  ?	"1. Increased HorsepowerRemoving the muffler won?t increase horsepower in all vehicles. However, it can make a significant improvement on many older cars. Cars with large engines or high power from the factory are more likely to get a boost by removing the muffler(s).The mufflers on older vehicles can be restrictive. They also increase the engine backpressure, which isn?t good for the motor anyway. By taking the muffler out of the equation, you can easily increase the top-end horsepower and further protect the engine. 2. Aggressive Exhaust NoteSure, the muffler delete is going to help the older engine, but it doesn?t provide any performance benefits for most newer models if your car doesn?t have a lot of horsepower. Instead, it?s done solely to change the tone coming from the car.When the muffler is removed, you get a more aggressive note coming from the exhaust. Considering the muffler reduces the noise coming from the engine, taking it off is going to accent the tone better. "
Muffler Delete Cons	"1. Loud ExhaustWhile this point was also an advantage, it can go either way for some people. The loud exhaust might sound exciting at first, but it can get old very quickly. If you plan on taking long road trips with the family, be prepared not to hear one another.As you push the car into higher RPMs, the sound gets even louder. The more air that comes through the exhaust, the louder it is going to be. It doesn?t take long for this noise to get annoying. 2. IllegalIf you remove the muffler from your vehicle, you might be breaking the law. Check your local laws to see what the regulations are.However, most cops aren?t going to pull you over for not having a muffler on. Still, they have every right to, especially if you are violating any local noise ordinances. 3. Reduces Engine PerformanceBy now, you are wondering why the disadvantages contradict the advantages. Yes, increasing engine performance was listed as a benefit, but only on older and high-powered vehicles.With a newer car with a smaller engine, removing the muffler can actually sometimes cause the opposite effect. The automaker created the ECM to work in conjunction with the muffler. If you remove it, you might notice worse performance. It?s also possible that the Check Engine Light could come on. 4. Failed EmissionsThirty-four states now require emissions testing. If you live in one of these states and you remove the catalytic converter, your vehicle isn?t going to pass the test. It can also cause the Check Engine Light to come on, which might cause you to automatically fail.However, just removing the muffler shouldn?t cause failed emissions. Still, if an inspection is performed, the technicians could fail your vehicle. To pass the vehicle, you will have to put the muffler back on, which defeats the purpose of taking it off in the first place. "
How Much Does a Muffler Delete Cost?	"The average cost for a muffler delete is between $150 and $450. You should only spend between $50 and $200 on the parts. If you can do the job yourself, you won?t spend anything on labor. Otherwise, expect to spend about $100 to $250. It can be difficult to find someone to perform a muffler delete. In most cases, removing the muffler is illegal, so it?s hard to find someone willing to participate in the modification. "
Aspects Determining Muffler Delete Cost ?	"1. Car StyleWhen you remove the muffler, you will still need to add a pipe to the exhaust system to connect it to the tailpipe. The parts needed for this depend on what type of car you drive. Additionally, the labor is going to be based on your type of vehicle. For example, if your car has a sophisticated exhaust system, the cost could be much higher than one that is straightforward. 2. Exhaust Pipe TypeThere are different types of exhaust pipes you can choose from. While you can get a mild steel pipe if you want to save money, it?s often better to spend a little more on stainless steel or, in some cases, even titanium.These pipes hold up better. While they will cost more upfront, you shouldn?t need to replace them any time soon, thereby giving you a better value. 3. LaborLabor rates vary based on where you live and what type of shop you are visiting. You can see a big difference in hourly rates based on what?s quoted in the city versus the country. Additionally, the type of shop you visit makes a difference. Expect to pay more if you visit an exhaust shop versus your traditional auto repair location. "
what is DIY Muffler Delete?	"1. Check Local LawsBefore you do anything with your exhaust, you want to research your state and local laws. In most cases, these modifications are illegal, so you want to understand what laws you are breaking before you do anything.These local laws also make it difficult to find an automotive technician willing to remove the muffler. Maybe that?s why you are trying to do it yourself in the first place. Otherwise, performing your own muffler delete helps you save money. 2. Jack the Car UpYou need to get under the car with plenty of room to move around. To do this, you will place it up on a jack with jack stands.Put the jack under the designated area laid out in the service manual. Jack up the car to an appropriate height and place jack stands underneath the vehicle to support it. 3. Remove Exhaust ClampsThe muffler is attached to the exhaust with the help of special clamps. These U-shaped clamps need to be removed if you want to take the muffler off. However, these clamps are often rusted, making them nearly impossible to remove.Before you get started, spray the nuts with WD-40 or another lubricating chemical. If you leave the solution soak on the nuts, it could make it easier to remove them. There are times when the only way to remove the muffler is to cut it. If the exhaust pipe has been welded in place, cutting it could be your only option. 4. Connect TailpipeWhen you add an exhaust pipe, you need to choose what type of material you want to use. You could spend less on mild steel pipes. However, a stainless steel pipe is going to provide more corrosion resistance. You won?t spend that much more to get one made from stainless steel, and the investment is worth the cost.You don?t always need to add an exhaust pipe. It depends on what kind of system your car has. However, adding an exhaust pipe can help to improve the performance of your vehicle. In most cases, a straight pipe needs to be connected to the exhaust pipe. This setup should provide all of the functions needed, but the measurements could be different, depending on what type of car you have.You may need a 90-degree exhaust adapter to connect your new exhaust pipe to the old one. Take your time to clamp the pipes together. If you prefer a permanent application, you may choose to weld the pipes to the exhaust. However, this is more difficult to change in the future, especially if you need to add something to pass an emissions test."
What is a straight pipe exhaust?	"A straight pipe exhaust is a straight exhaust system from the exhaust manifold without a muffler, resonator, or catalytic converter. Straight pipe exhausts are often loud ? really loud. They are usually found in racing cars and performance vehicles due to the performance boost.These exhaust systems let exhaust fumes flow freely from the engine?s exhaust headers, allowing them to go into the atmosphere directly through the exhaust tip. They increase your engine?s horsepower because there are no restrictions on the exhaust, and the gases flow freely.But are there other advantages besides a great sound?"
what is the Straight Pipe Exhaust Advantages ?	"There are many advantages that come with a straight pipe exhaust system. Here?re some of the most obvious ones:1. Increased PerformanceThe biggest reason that many people opt for a straight pipe exhaust is that these systems enhance your car?s horsepower and torque. These systems reduce back pressure from the engine, allowing the exhaust gases to flow freely and help the engine perform without hindrances.2. AestheticsStraight pipes also make your car stand out in the crowd if someone looks under your car. You can apply a chrome finish to the exhaust tip to make it look appealing.Various types of welding methods are used to give beautiful colors to the tip. Furthermore, you can go for a twin-pipe setup for an even better aesthetic.3. Engine?s True SoundThe straight pipe exhaust system lets out the true sound of an engine. Since there are no restrictions like a muffler, resonators, catalytic converter or other components, the car sounds raw and pure.However, you might have to rethink starting your car early in the morning as that would definitely wake your neighbors.4. Less WeightCatalytic converters and mufflers weigh a lot, and if you are into racing, you probably know that the weight of your car is a bad thing. A straight pipe exhaust weighs much less than the original exhaust.5. Better fuel economyA lot of people don?t know that by removing the mufflers and catalytic converter, the engine will create less back pressure which leads to better combustion. This means that you will also get a lower fuel consumption with a straight pipe exhaust on most car engines."
what is the Straight Pipe Disadvantages ?	"Just like everything else in the world, a straight pipe exhaust system has its advantages and disadvantages. It is up to us to decide what to sacrifice and what to gain.4. Difficult to sellYour car will be difficult to sell with a straight pipe exhaust installed, so always keep the original system to install it back later on your car when it is time to sell it.5. Not road legalIf you are going to modify your street car with a straight-pipe exhaust system, you should think twice. Removing the catalytic converters or mufflers is not legal in most states in the United States, but it does vary from state to state. Therefore, you want to examine the rules of your state before cutting the exhaust pipe.If your car is not insanely loud and you do not keep 7000 rpm when you cold start it in the morning in your neighborhood, then you will most likely be fine. However, you can attract some problems when doing the annual inspection of the car, depending on the state.1. Not Cost-EffectiveStraight piping installation is expensive. Completely new pipes are not cheap and are hard to come by for a good price, so there is a trend for custom-built exhaust pipes. Furthermore, after you opt for a straight pipe exhaust system, you often have to tune your vehicle according to certain standards to get the most out of it.2. Rampant EmissionsYes. Straight pipes make the best sound, but they are not great for the environment. In the late 20th century, catalytic converters were introduced to vehicles to counter the effects of pollution and harmful emissions caused by cars.When you straight pipe your car, you often remove the catalytic converter, which is really bad for the environment and exhaust emission tests.3. Often Too LoudSometimes, the only reason motorheads go for a straight pipe setup is that they want their car to sound loud. They don?t realize that straight pipes can make their car extremely loud to the extent that starting and driving one in a suburban neighborhood could warrant police attention.Enthusiasts that go for such systems usually only drive their racing cars on race tracks. So, if you are lucky enough to have a race-track in your city, a straight pipe setup would be a great inclusion for your vehicle as you will be able to test it to its limits."
How Much Does a Straight Pipe Exhaust Cost?	"A normal straight pipe exhaust for most cars costs between $200 to $600, with a labor cost of $100 to $200 if you want a professional to install it, so you can expect a total cost of $300 to $800 for a straight pipe exhaust.But ultimately, how much a straight pipe exhaust costs depends completely on what type of car you have and what type of exhaust you want.If you can weld yourself and are willing to destroy the original exhaust pipe system, you can get this done for a much lower cost. Remember that it is good to have the original exhaust if you want to sell the car.If you want really high-standard exhaust pipes made of titanium, you will have to spend even more."
How much HP does straight pipe add?	"You can expect an additional 0-10 hp on a standard car with a straight pipe. The amount of horsepower and torque a straight pipe exhaust adds totally depends on your car model and which modifications you have already made.A very powerful engine will thrive much more with a straight pipe, and in this case, you can add a lot of horsepower, just by letting these horsepowers free by removing the restriction. On standard cars with a 4 cylinder engine, you may not notice any difference at all!"
What?s better a muffler delete or a straight pipe?	"The most restrictive part of the exhaust system is the catalytic converter. If you decide to remove the mufflers, your car will definitely be louder, but it may not help a lot with the flow of exhausts, and therefore you may not notice a horsepower increase.However, removing the mufflers and not the catalytic converter is a much better way to avoid trouble and save the environment. A muffler delete is often much cheaper than a whole straight pipe exhaust. It?s also a cheaper option to replace the exhaust pipe from the catalytic converter and back ? also called an aftermarket cat-back exhaust system."
Do I have to tune your car after straight pipe?	"You might have to tune your car after installing a straight pipe, but it depends on the rest of your setup and your car model. If you have other modifications also, like a high-flow air filter, you might need to re-tune your car to take advantage of the new airflow through the engine. A straight exhaust pipe will only reach its full potential with a tune."
Can a straight pipe exhaust damage the engine?	"There is some debate over whether a straight pipe exhaust can damage an engine, but most experts seem to agree that it can. Reducing the backpressure with a straight pipe exhaust can in some cases cause your air-fuel mixture to run lean, which can damage the engine?s internal parts. It may also increase the horsepower and torque of your car engine, which it may not handle well. Therefore, a tune is recommended after installing a straight pipe exhaust."
Is it OK to run an engine without exhaust?	"It is possible to run an engine without an exhaust. However, it?s not advisable because it will make the engine crazy loud. Also, running an engine without exhaust can be dangerous to your health, as the fumes will enter the cabin and you will be inhaling all of those fumes and gases. There is also a huge risk of fire, due to the exhaust combustion coming directly out from the cylinder head. So, if you?re having problems with your vehicle?s exhaust system, get it fixed as soon as possible."
How can I make my straight pipe sound better?	"If you are not happy with your straight pipe exhaust sound, you can try to change it to other materials like a titanium exhaust. You can also try experimenting with different pipe sizes and shapes."
Do Diesel Engines Have Catalytic Converters?	"Yes. Many diesel cars have a catalytic converter, but not in the same way that a gas-powered car does. Some diesel engines contain a two-way catalytic converter with a diesel oxidization catalyst, but it could be a three-way design that adds an SCR reduction. Diesel engine emissions go through four stages: there?s the EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation), as well as the DPF (Diesel Particulate Filtration), plus the DOC (Diesel Oxidization Catalyst) and the SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction). The catalysts produce chemical reactions to reduce harmful emissions in the DOC and SCR stages."
How Does the Diesel Catalytic Converter Work?	"The diesel catalytic converter is responsible for converting harmful substances into forms that are non-toxic. Inside the metal casing are two ceramic blocks that contain thousands of micro-cellular units, looking like a honeycomb. All of the ceramic blocks have a metal coating, such as platinum or palladium. The catalytic converter is located closer to the engine, with the converter heating up to catalyze the chemical reactions. These reactions convert toxic gases into harmless byproducts that can be released into the atmosphere.The Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) is very similar in function to the equivalent part in a gas engine. Carbon monoxide is reduced to water and carbon with the help of metal catalysts. During this time, the volatile hydrocarbons and byproducts are broken down into less harmful substances, so the emissions of dangerous gases are reduced. However, this cat doesn?t contain rhodium like it would if it were in a gas engine. It also includes a diesel particulate filter (DPF) that eliminates particulate matter that isn?t found in a converter equipped to a gas-powered engine.The SCR is responsible for breaking down the Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) into Nitrogen and Oxygen with the help of an ammonia-based catalyst. This open-loop system can reduce NOx emissions by 75 to 90 percent. SCR is also needed to reduce hydrocarbon emissions, but is only about eight percent effective. Using low sulfur fuel helps improve performance. "
How Long Does A Diesel Catalytic Converter Last?	"A diesel catalytic converter can last for 100,000 miles or about ten years. However, its health depends on how long your trips are and how the vehicle is treated. If you regularly take shorter trips, the catalytic converter could wear out prematurely. During shorter trips, the engine gets turned off before the converter can obtain the appropriate operating temperature to catalyze the compounds. The more often this occurs, the more wear the converter deals with. "
what are the Signs of a Failed Diesel Catalytic Converter ?	"If you recognize the signs that the converter is failing, you can have it replaced and not miss a beat. There are a couple of reasons the converter can fail early. A few of the most common causes for premature failure include:Free flow of exhaust gases is restrictedBuild-up of carbon depositsPhysical damageOverheatingPoor engine maintenanceMost modern cars use oxygen sensors that help determine if the catalytic converter is in need. When the oxygen sensors don?t receive the proper reading, they cause the Check Engine Light to come on. You can use a code scanner to figure out what?s causing the issue.Aside from the Check Engine Light, you might also notice these symptoms that the catalytic converter is failing:"
what is the Diesel Catalytic Converter Replacement Cost ?	"Having the catalytic converter replaced isn?t going to be an inexpensive job. It?s just as expensive or more expensive than with a gas-powered car. On average, you can expect to spend between $900 and $2,500, based on your car model and the material of the converter. This estimate includes both parts and labor.If you are able to do the replacement yourself, you could save a small amount of money. However, the majority of the costs are made up of the part itself. Because of how much it costs to get a new catalytic converter, some drivers choose to put theft-proof features on it to prevent it from being stolen. For $50 or less, you can easily keep the catalytic converter protected from thieves. "
Can the Car Run Without a Diesel Catalytic Converter?	"There?s nothing stopping the vehicle from driving with the catalytic converter missing. The engine is still going to work and you won?t be stranded without it. However, the emissions standards won?t be the same and you could notice some engine performance problems.Additionally, catalytic converters are required by law. If you run your vehicle without one, you could face some stiff fines. You aren?t responsible for getting an emissions test, so that?s not the problem, but the safety inspection could flag it when you go to renew your registration. "
Does Catalytic Converter Cleaning Work?	"As carbon builds up inside the catalytic converter, it can become clogged. Some people assume this means that the only option is to replace the catalytic converter, but that?s not the case. There are products that claim to clean the catalytic converter. While there?s a lot of controversy over whether these catalytic cleaner products work, most people agree that it?s worth trying. Paying a small amount for a simple cleaner could save you from needing to put on a new converter.Additionally, some people find that using a catalytic converter cleaner can help maintain the life of this valuable part. While many of the products will recommend using a bottle every 3,000 to 4,000 miles, this guideline is overkill. You should be able to see results if you use it twice a year while driving the average amount of miles."
How Much Does a Catalytic Converter Replacement Cost?	"The average catalytic converter replacement cost is between $400 and $2,500, for the parts and labor. However, it?s not the labor that costs so much. Rather, the catalytic converter will make up most of the cost, mainly because of the expensive materials used in the interior construction of the part. Catalytic converter replacement can be one of the most expensive auto repair tasks. Depending on the value of your car, it might not be worth replacing the catalytic converter. However, you can prevent the need for a new catalytic converter by maintaining your vehicle. If you get the spark plugs changed regularly and keep the engine running its best, the catalytic converter will continue working as it was intended. It?s when you neglect your vehicle?s care that the catalytic converter starts to fail. If the Check Engine Light comes on, take it seriously and have it looked at."
Factors that Affect Catalytic Converter Replacement Cost ?	"1. Vehicle TypeIf you drive an older car, you might spend less to replace the catalytic converter. Older vehicles have cheaper catalytic converters, possibly only costing a few hundred dollars.However, newer cars contain more sophisticated catalytic converters, which drastically increases the price. Additionally, if your vehicle has a dual exhaust system, there might be two catalytic converters to deal with. 2. Quality of New PartAs with any auto part, no two are created the same. You can find a generic catalytic converter that will get the job done, but it might not provide the best fit or superior materials. A cheap catalytic converter won?t have the same level of precious metals inside, making it less efficient and not as durable. You will be replacing the catalytic converter again in the future. The higher-end catalytic converter can contain a density of six times the amount of materials when compared with a cheaper option. You may also notice a check engine light together with the P0420 code on your dashboard if you install a cheap catalytic converter.3. Labor ExpensesAs with any auto repair, the labor expense factors into what you will spend. If you can do the job yourself, you might save some money. However, replacing a catalytic converter isn?t normally a job to be done in a home garage. It?s possible that the old catalytic converter needs to be cut off and the new one could be welded in place. If you have a dual exhaust, you must perform the task twice.Additionally, labor rates are different within every region. If you live in a city, you might spend more than your countryside neighbors. You will also pay more to visit a dealership or specialized exhaust shop over using your local auto repair garage. Evaluate the pricing around you, but don?t choose a shop based on the cheapest rates. If the job takes them twice the time to complete the task, you could actually end up spending more. 4. Other Diagnostics/RepairsWhen you take your vehicle to the auto repair shop, you have more expenses than just getting the catalytic converter replaced. You will also need to pay for any relevant diagnostic charges.Aside from that, if there are other issues with the exhaust system, those repairs could also be added in. It?s possible for multiple systems or parts to fail at the same time, especially if another fault has caused the catalytic converter to go bad. "
what are the Symptoms of Bad Catalytic Converter ?	"Here is a brief of the most common symptoms you may notice. However, check our other article down below if you want a more detailed guide: 8 Symptoms of a Bad Catalytic Converter1. Failed Emissions TestThirty-four states now require emissions testing. Sometimes the first sign that drivers recognize something is wrong is when the car fails its emissions test.When the catalytic converter isn?t working right, the emissions aren?t going to be ideal for the environment. Because additional gases are getting pumped into the atmosphere, you won?t be able to pass the test until you have the catalytic converter replaced. 2. Check Engine LightAnother one of the earliest signs is when the Check Engine Light comes on. As the catalytic converter starts to fail, the oxygen sensors send a signal to the ECU, letting it know that there?s a problem.When you use your code scanner to read the Check Engine Light, you should see where the problem lies. Replacing the catalytic converter and any other failed parts will be required to get the Check Engine Light off once again. 3. Rotten Egg SmellIf you smell rotten eggs in your car, it could be that you just left some trash in the cabin. However, it?s more likely that there?s a problem with the catalytic converter.The rotten egg smell occurs because of hydrogen sulfide. When the catalytic converter is working as it should, this compound gets turned into sulfur dioxide, which doesn?t have any smell. However, when the compound comes out of the tailpipe without being properly converted, it leads to a terrible stench. 4. Poor AccelerationAs carbon builds up in the catalytic converter?s honeycomb design, it becomes impossible for it to continue converting gases as it should. This blockage creates poor performance because the engine needs a good amount of airflow to be optimized.The blockage leads to the wrong amount of backpressure, which can dramatically influence the overall airflow. The less airflow there is, the more the power is reduced. You will notice the lack of power the most when you attempt to accelerate. 5. Decreased Fuel EconomyWhen the catalytic converters backs up, it causes more than just poor performance. As the engine becomes starved of air, it can?t run efficiently. The harder the engine needs to work, the more fuel it will go through. You will see reduced fuel economy, which only further hurts your pocket every time you need to fill the tank. "
What is the Catalytic Converter?	"The catalytic converter is part of your car?s exhaust system. It looks similar to a muffler, but it is constructed with different materials. Inside the catalytic converter, there?s a unique honeycomb-like structure that contains catalyst particles that interact with the exhaust gases. These particles can include rhodium, palladium and platinum.The unburned hydrocarbons located in your car?s exhaust react with these materials in the catalytic converter. As the hydrocarbons are heated up, they break down into emissions that are less toxic and harmful to the environment. After the catalytic converter, these gases exit into the atmosphere through the tailpipe. "
Can the Catalytic Converter Be Removed?	"You might think that the most obvious solution is to simply take off the catalytic converter. Some people choose to do this and install a straight pipe, but is that the best solution? Yes, it makes for a cheaper repair, but there are reasons that it?s a terrible idea. First of all, your car is going to fail emissions testing; there?s no way around it. Additionally, the car is going to dramatically suffer, with performance and efficiency. On top of that, you are allowing more pollution to enter the environment, making you part of the problem.The only real solution is to replace the catalytic converter. If the car isn?t worth the expense, then it?s time to get rid of it and buy something else. Don?t take shortcuts when it comes to replacing the catalytic converter."
What Does Black Smoke from Exhaust Mean?	"When black smoke starts pouring out of the exhaust, it means that the engine is burning an excessive amount of fuel. The fuel can be mixed in abundance with oil inside the engine or it might be contaminated. This condition can occur in both gasoline and diesel engines. There are some cases when black smoke points to a minor problem that can be fixed quickly. However, black smoke can also indicate a serious condition, possibly even requiring an engine replacement. "
Black Smoke from Exhaust Causes ?	"1. Clogged Air FilterDirty Air FilterIf dust or contaminants block the air filter, there won?t be enough air hitting the cylinder. Because of this, more fuel is going to be burnt, leading to black smoke in the exhaust.Additionally, you will notice heavier smoke when the vehicle is put under pressure. If you are accelerating hard or towing heavy loads, there might be more black smoke coming from the tailpipe.2. Malfunctioning Fuel InjectorBad Fuel InjectorWhen the fuel injectors work as intended, the fuel gets atomized and spread equally into the cylinder. Malfunctioning injectors might not close properly or they can become clogged, both of which lead to problems.If more fuel is injected into the cylinders, it causes the engine to run rich. There won?t be enough air in the combustion chamber, which can lead to black smoke from the exhaust. 3. Failed EGR ValveEgr Valve EngineThe EGR valve is responsible for recirculating the exhaust gas to reduce the emissions of dangerous substances. It takes the exhaust gas and puts some of it back into the combustion chamber. When the EGR valve becomes damaged or faulty on a diesel engine, there aren?t enough gases being circulated. As a result, black smoke will start coming from the exhaust. 4. Bad MAF SensorMaf Sensor LocationThe Mass Airflow Sensors evaluate how much air is entering the engine. With this data, the injectors know how much fuel to combine for combustion.However, when the sensors fail, the wrong data can be sent. This causes the engine to think it needs more fuel than necessary, creating a rich-running environment. When the MAF sensor fails, you will also notice performance issues. 5. Bad Glow Plugs (Diesel)Glow Plug E1625147929280If you have a diesel engine, it?s possible the glow plugs have gone bad. You will notice other symptoms with this problem, such as trouble starting the vehicle.With a 12-volt test light, you can check the glow plugs. In some models, they are easy to replace, while others can prove to be more difficult. 6. Engine DepositsAs the engine ages, deposits start to form, leading to black smoke from the exhaust. The byproducts of combustion start to build up in the injectors and combustion chamber.Not only can these deposits interfere with engine performance, but they can eventually cause the motor to fail completely. To prevent these deposits, it?s important to use the right type of fuel and choose it from a top-tier station. "
How to Fix Black Smoke from Exhaust ?	"1. Clean Air SystemFor combustion to work as intended, the right amount of air must enter the engine. If there is a lack of air, fuel is only going to partially burn, leading to black smoke. The first step is to check the air filter and make sure it?s not clogged. This part should be replaced regularly, as part of the regular maintenance. Replacing the air filter should only cost you a few bucks and it is an easy task that doesn?t require any special tools. 2. Apply Fuel AdditivesDeposits and debris from the combustion process can build up in the cylinders and fuel injectors. As the deposits build up, fuel economy is reduced, performance is lowered and black smoke can be seen.However, there are additives available with detergents that will clean out the deposits. To use these, simply follow the directions on the bottle, generally instructing you to put the contents into the fuel tank after filling up. 3. Change SensorsIf the Mass Airflow Sensor is sending back the wrong information, there will be an excessive amount of fuel in the combustion chamber. You can find the sensor inside the air filter housing.In some cases, it?s possible to simply clean off the sensor and reinstall it. Other times, you will want to replace it to ensure proper readings. 4. Replace Glow Plugs (Diesel)If you drive a diesel vehicle and haven?t changed the glow plugs lately, now might be a good time. Just like spark plugs in a gas engine, the glow plugs should be changed as part of regular maintenance. You can find the service schedule in your owner?s manual for the proper interval.Replacing the glow plugs isn?t an expensive task. If you have some mechanical knowledge, you should have no trouble doing it yourself. "
Can I Drive a Car With Black Smoke Coming from the Exhaust?	"While it?s entirely possible to drive the car with black smoke out of the exhaust, you might not want to. When the engine runs rich, too much fuel is being mixed in the combustion chamber. This problem leads to many performance issues and could cause you to become stranded if the issues become too great.Even worse, the excessive amount of unburned fuel coming from the exhaust can cause damage to the catalytic converter over time. This is an expensive part to replace. Fixing the problem early can help you avoid this unnecessary bill. "

Believe it or not, some of these cleaners may not work for all types of engines.If you have a gasoline car or bike, you need not worry, as most catalytic converter cleaners will work. On the contrary, if you have a vehicle with a modern, hybrid engine or a diesel-powered vehicle, you need to check the compatibility.What you must note here is that most quality cleaners are compatible with all types of engines. So, if you choose a good catalytic converter cleaner, it will certainly work for your vehicle.Cleaning RangeYou are looking for a cleaner to treat your catalytic converter. However, most solutions out there offer an all-round clean up. They clean the entire exhaust system, including carburetors, oxygen sensors, valves, passageways, and more.All the parts of the fuel system are interconnected. Even if one part does not function well, the entire operation can get ruined. Choosing a cleaning solution that covers the whole exhaust system will ensure the perfect working of your vehicle engine.It will minimize the emissions to great extents as carbon deposits are found throughout the system. Moreover, the mileage, fuel efficiency, and overall performance of your vehicle will also improve.Bottle CapacityYou may find catalytic converter bottles of different sizes and capacities. Though it may vary according to the brand and type of cleaner, most fuel tanks require a whole bottle. One thing you must note here is that once you break the seal, its contents will not be efficient for long.Therefore, the wisest option would be to get a bottle of around 10-20 ounces for an average tank of 16 gallons. In addition, you may see plenty of multipack options in this line.Since you may need a catalytic converter cleaner for maintaining your vehicle regularly, getting a multipack is highly recommended. They are comparatively economical, and you can use the small bottles one at a time.Cleaning EfficiencyThe size and number of bottles that you will need also depend on the cleaning efficiency of the solution.

In this article, you get the 8 best catalytic converter cleaners. So, choose the best catalytic converter cleaner for your vehicle engine to ensure its flawless performance!"
Do catalytic converter cleaners actually work?	"Yes, they do work well in most cases. However, if your catalytic converter is damaged or too clogged, it may actually not work for you. If it is slightly clogged, it will do wonders to your catalytic converter."
Can a clogged catalytic converter be cleaned?	"Yes, a clogged catalytic converter can be cleaned if it is not too clogged with some additives. A too clogged catalytic converter will need to get replaced."
What happens if you don?t fix catalytic converter?	"If you just keep driving your car with a bad catalytic converter, it will probably stop running after a while because the exhaust needs somewhere to go. The backpressure can damage other parts of your engine, though, so it is not recommended."
Can I put Cataclean in full tank?	"Yes, you can put Cataclean in a full tank. Just calculate the right amount you need and make sure there is enough room in the tank for the Cataclean product."
How to Prevent Catalytic Converter Theft?	"You can protect your catalytic converter from theft by etching your license plate number on the catalytic converter. You can also park in a well-lit area to discourage thieves and install a specialized catalytic converter anti-theft device to keep this valuable car part intact.Here is a more detailed list of the different methods on how to protect your catalytic converter against theft:1. Park the Vehicle in a Well-Lit AreaLit Parking LotYou don?t want to make your vehicle an easy target. Most thieves don?t want to do anything that will draw attention, especially if there are other vehicles that would be easier to steal from.Most thefts will occur overnight when there is less light. To prevent this, you want to park in an area that is well-lit so the vehicle can be seen easier. Even better, if you can park in a location with security cameras focused on the vehicle, you will further deter would-be thieves. 2. Etch License Plate Number to ConverterCatalytic ConverterBy having your license plate number etched into the catalytic converter, you make the stolen part identifiable to law enforcement agencies. Hopefully, if the thief sees the license plate etched on the converter, they will avoid it altogether.In some regions, you can take part in a local etching event. Contact your local auto shop to see if the police sponsor any events near you. 3. Add an Anti-Theft DeviceCatshieldPaying attention to where you park the vehicle and etching your license plate number into the catalytic converter are both going to deter thieves, but neither of these will stop the part from coming off of your vehicle. The only way to do that is to install an anti-theft product. You can have a metal shield bolted to the frame of your vehicle that covers the catalytic converter. In total, you might spend $250 to $500 for this shield. You can also find armor plating or caged designs that work the same.Plus, you can purchase the same products for about $100 online and put it on at home. To install it, you only need to drill a few holes in the frame and attach it with the included fasteners. However, you will need to lift the vehicle to get underneath it. One brand selling these that we heard a lot good about is the Catshield Anti Theft. You can check if they have one ready for your car model. We receive a small commission if you buy one through our link. You can use the coupon code MECHANICBASE to get 5% off your purchase."
Why Do Catalytic Converters Get Stolen?	"Catalytic converters are made from a variety of precious metals. These converters contain palladium, rhodium and platinum to create a chemical reaction that changes the dangerous exhaust gases. By taking the catalytic converter to certain auto repair shops or recyclers, they can make a few hundred dollars.Theft of catalytic converters isn?t a new phenomenon. Still, there seems to be an increase in this crime lately because of the economic insecurity created by the pandemic. With people still spending a lot of time indoors, there are also fewer people around to witness the event, making it easier to accomplish. Furthermore, the catalytic converter isn?t difficult to remove with the tools. In total, the criminal might only need a few minutes to get the converter off. However, stealing the converter is also a crime and can be punishable by law. Some cars seem more susceptible to catalytic converter theft than others. For example, the Toyota Prius has a catalytic converter that stays in better shape because of the hybrid powertrain, making it worth more money. Additionally, trucks and SUVs tend to be victimized because of how easy it is to get underneath the vehicle. "
Steps to Take if Catalytic Converter is Stolen ?	"It?s not hard to tell when the catalytic converter has been stolen off of a vehicle. Immediately after starting the engine, you will hear a loud rumbling from the exhaust, signifying that this valuable part is missing. For starters, you will need to contact your insurance company if you plan to file a claim. You will have to supply pictures of the area where the catalytic converter once was. The provider might also require a police report, which should be filed whether insurance is covering the replacement or not. Your next step is to have a new catalytic converter installed. Your local muffler shop will know what?s best and legal, as some states don?t allow aftermarket converters. If you can choose an aftermarket option, it might make the catalytic converter less attractive to thieves in the future.You don?t want to wait to have the converter put on. It not only pumps out harmful emissions, but it could also be harmful to your health. Additionally, you could get pulled over and receive a hefty fine. While you are having the new catalytic converter installed, make sure you speak to the repair shop about an anti-theft device to prevent this from happening again. "
Catalytic Converter Replacement Cost	"Replacing a catalytic converter can cost $800 to $2500. The parts alone can make up the majority of that bill since this is such an expensive part. It?s not the labor that adds to the cost. On the bright side, you might be able to have your insurance provider pay for the new catalytic converter. The full coverage policy that includes liability, collision and comprehensive typically covers these stolen parts. You will have full coverage if you have an existing car loan or lease. If you want the insurance company to pay for the catalytic converter, you will be responsible for paying the deductible. If this deductible is high, it might not make sense to run it through the insurance company at all because your rates will likely go up."
How to Bypass Oxygen Sensors?	"While you can bypass an oxygen sensor with the help of a dummy O2 sensor, it?s not always the best option. In some cases, it could be illegal, and in other cases, it can mess with the performance of the vehicle. However, it?s easy to do. You just have to swap the defective sensor with a dummy.Here are some detailed steps on how to bypass an oxygen sensor:1. Prepare the CarYou don?t want to work with a hot car. Instead, allow it to cool down completely before getting started. It could take several hours for the exhaust to cool completely after driving.Disconnect the negative battery cable from the terminal. Simply loosen the nut and slide the clamp away from the terminal.2. Lift VehicleYou want to get your vehicle up in the air, so you have more room to work. Using the front jack point of the vehicle, jack up the car. Put jack stands under the frame towards the front of the vehicle. Gently lower the vehicle back down on the stands. 3. Disconnect O2 SensorFind the O2 sensor that needs to be removed. It should be part of the exhaust system, and it resembles a plug. You may find it in the catalytic converter or before and after it, run by two separate sensors.Carefully unplug the wiring attached to the sensor. You must squeeze the tab to release it before pulling it away from its housing. Finally, turn it counterclockwise using a special oxygen sensor removal tool. 4. Insert Dummy O2 SensorInstall your new dummy sensor, otherwise known as an O2 sensor simulator. You put it in by turning the sensor clockwise, just as if you were replacing it with a new O2 sensor. Connect the wiring to the sensor and lower the vehicle back down to the ground. You are ready to start the car and see if the Check Engine Light has gone off. You may also need to drive it for a short distance to get the light off. Remember that depending on where you live, it can be illegal to install a dummy O2 sensor!"
Should I Bypass Oxygen Sensors?	"Bypassing the oxygen sensor with a dummy can be done. Many people will do this to get the Check Engine Light to turn off when emissions aren?t right or to allow for more flexibility when tuning the engine. If you want to remove the first sensor before the catalytic converter, you will need an O2 sensor simulator, which can be found online. If you want to remove the second sensor behind the catalytic converter to get rid of the P0420 or P0421 code, you can often use an adapter like this.However, it?s not legal in all parts of the country, so you want to check your local laws before performing this hack. Additionally, you won?t want to mess with the oxygen sensor found before the catalytic converter unless you know how to tune the engine. This O2 sensor is responsible for controlling the fuel and air mixture, so the performance of the engine could suffer without it.The O2 sensor working with the catalytic converter is there strictly to monitor emissions. Removing this one doesn?t change how the car runs; it just keeps you from knowing when the car is working as it should. "
What are Oxygen Sensors?	"The oxygen sensor is otherwise referred to as the lambda sensor. It?s been around since the 1960s and was originally designed for Bosch. This electronic sensor measures how much oxygen is in gas. While the original design contained platinum and ceramic-coated zirconia, planar sensors soon became the norm for mass production.NTK created the modern O2 sensor in 1990, originally to be used in several Honda models. It was created from High-Temperature Cofired Ceramic (HTCC), making it more efficient. Now, all modern cars feature oxygen sensors.This sensor can be found in the emissions system. It?s responsible for sending data about the oxygen levels back to the engine computer where adjustments can be made. It has a profound impact on the performance of the vehicle and alerts you to trouble with emissions. If you live in a state that requires emissions testing, a faulty oxygen sensor could fail you. At a bare minimum, there is one O2 sensor before the catalytic converter. There can also be a sensor in every exhaust manifold, so it?s difficult to know how many each car has. In many of today?s vehicles, there can be four oxygen sensors. "
How to Test an Oxygen Sensor ?	"If you think there?s a bad oxygen sensor on your vehicle, you can test it. You will need a back probe and a digital voltmeter. To test the O2 sensor, you must first find the wires that run to it. Give these wires a visual inspection to ensure there is no damage and everything looks good. If there?s wear and tear, you want to replace the sensor.If everything looks good, you want to start the car engine. Allow it to run until it reaches at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. This step ensures that the reading will be accurate. Turn off the engine temporarily while you set up the connectors. With your voltmeter and back probe, measure the oxygen sensor at a few different points to see if the measurements are faulty. You can connect the back probe to the signal wire and connect the voltmeter?s positive lead to the back probe. Next, you will connect the voltmeter?s negative lead to a ground on the chassis. Set the voltmeter to the 1-volt scale. Start the vehicle and check the voltmeter?s reading. It should change quickly. If it is only reading 0.5 volts, the vehicle might not be warmed enough. If it isn?t changing after the engine is warmed, there is something wrong with the sensor. You can also create a vacuum leak to check how the sensor deals with a lean mixture. There?s also the option to do a propane enrichment test. If you aren?t familiar with either of these, it might be best to visit a mechanic for professional guidance."
How do I turn off the rear o2 sensor?	"To turn off the rear O2 sensor, simply remove it from the car. It will however light up the check light on your dashboard and to get rid of it, you will either need to install an O2 sensor simulator or reprogram the ECM. These procedures can be illegal depending on where you live, so check the laws and rules first."
What happens if you cut off your o2 sensors?	"If you cut off your O2 sensors, you will not receive oxygen readings from your car and it will run on simulated values. This means that your car will not be able to adjust the air/fuel mixture to compensate for any changes in altitude or weather conditions, and it may cause your car to run poorly or even damage the engine. You will also see a check engine light on your dashboard."
Are oxygen sensors necessary?	"Yes. Oxygen sensors are necessary in order to maintain the fuel/air mixture in the cylinders. If there is no oxygen sensor, the ECU will not know when to adjust the fuel/air mixture, and your car will either run too rich (lots of unburned fuel) or too lean (not enough fuel). This will cause decreased performance, increased emissions, and possibly even engine damage."
How do I make an O2 simulator?	"There are a few different ways to make an O2 simulator. The most common way is to install resistors instead of O2 sensors. The resistors you need depend on the car model you drive and the type of sensor installed. However, this is easier to do with the rear O2 sensor than the front, as the upstream sensor needs values to control the air/fuel mixture."
Conclusion	"To bypass an oxygen sensor in a car, you can either use a dummy oxygen sensor or replace it with a resistor with the correct resistance. However, bypassing oxygen sensors may be illegal depending on where you live and you will end up with a check engine light or performance issues unless you reprogram the engine control module for the removal of the oxygen sensor.Bypassing the downstream oxygen sensor is the most common way to get rid of the P0420 code. Bypassing this sensor will not affect engine performance, but you will need to reprogram the ECU to get rid of the check engine light.Bypassing the upstream oxygen sensor is much more difficult due to the importance of the sensor in operating the engine with an optimal air-fuel mixture.I hope you now have the knowledge to determine whether or not to bypass the oxygen sensors in your car.

what are the Exhaust Leak Symptoms?	"The main symptoms of an exhaust leak include:Higher engine sound than usualBlowing sound from underneath the carCheck engine lightLow Engine PerformanceUnusual OdorFailed emission testWhile these are not all possible signs, it?s a good start. If you suspect that your exhaust has started to leak fumes, take a look through the list below and see if you can diagnose the problem. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a leaking exhaust to look for:1. Higher Engine Sound Than UsualNoise From CarThe first symptom that you will notice when you have an exhaust leak is that your car will probably sound louder than usual.You will find one or two mufflers that are heavily reducing the engine sound on your exhaust pipe.If the exhaust leak occurs before one of these mufflers, the sound will not be silenced by the mufflers because it will flow out before them. This will cause a higher engine sound, depending on how large the exhaust leak is.2. Blowing sound from underneathCar Exhaust SoundIf the exhaust leak is just a small hole, it can sometimes create a blowing sound when you rev the engine. Depending on the size of the whole it can create different sounds, and in some cases, it can even cause high pitch whistling noises.If you can hear a ?blowing? sound from underneath your car and it wasnt there before, you most likely have an exhaust leak.3. Check Engine lightCheck Engine Light Reset ItselfModern cars have sensors on the exhaust system to measure the fuel mixture escaping from the engine. One of these sensors also measures the efficiency of the catalytic converter. These sensors are called O2 or Oxygen Sensors.If you have an exhaust leak before one of these sensors, it will cause them to measure faulty values, and the engine control unit will recognize this. This will cause the check engine light to appear on your dashboard.4. Low Engine PerformanceSlow AccelerationThe same thing applies here as with the check engine light. When there is an exhaust leak before one of these sensors on the exhaust pipe, they will get wrong values, and they will send false information to the engine control unit.The engine control unit will then use this information to calculate the air-fuel mixture of the next cycle in the car engine, and because the values are wron, it will cause an even stranger air-fuel mixture. This can cause rough idle, slow acceleration, rough acceleration, and misfires.If you hear a louder noise than usual from the engine and notice that the engine performance has dropped, it is definitely time to look for an exhaust leak.5. Unusual OdorBad Car Smell E1609777166642Another clear indicator that your exhaust has developed a leak is if you can smell exhaust fumes when the engine is running.As stated at the outset, your exhaust system has been designed to prevent this from happening. So, if you begin to notice a strange smell, something on the exhaust has failed and can no longer contain the fumes. Prolonged exposure to exhaust fumes can be incredibly harmful to humans. If you do begin to notice the smell of exhaust fumes, then try and get the leak fixed as soon as possible. 6. Failed emission testCar Emission TestIn some states and countries globally, you have to do a yearly emission test to pass the inspection. If you have an exhaust leak anywhere on the exhaust system, it will affect the emission test.If the leak is before the O2 sensors, it will mess with the air-fuel mixture, and if the leak is after the O2 sensors, the emission test will show a too lean mixture, and you will fail the test, depending on the size of the exhaust leak."
How To Find An Exhaust Leak ?	
Is it Safe to Drive with an Exhaust Leak? 	"I do not recommend driving around with an exhaust leak, because it is harmful to both you and the environment. There is also a risk that your car will catch on fire if you are unlucky.The safety of the vehicle will depend greatly on what?s causing your exhaust leak. As already stated, exhaust fumes can be harmful if you?re exposed to them for a prolonged period of time. Exhaust fumes are very hot, and sometimes the fuel in the exhaust pipe gets ignited. If you are unlucky and the exhaust leak is in the wrong place, it can cause your car to catch fire.If you?re not sure, have your exhaust inspected by a professional, as this can usually be carried out either free of charge or at very little cost."
Exhaust Leak Repair Cost ?	"The average exhaust leak repair cost is usually between $100 and $800, heavily depending on where the exhaust leak is.Here are the average repair costs for exhaust leak repairs. These prices are including part and labor costs. This can heavily depend on your car model.Part Replacement	Replacement CostCatback Exhaust Replacement	$150 to $600Exhaust Joint Replacement	$30 to $200Exhaust Pipe Welding	$20 to $100Catalytic Converter Replacement	$400 to $1500Exhaust braided flex pipe	$100 to $300Whole Exhaust Pipe Replacement	$300 to $1200Front Exhaust pipe replacement	$150 to $600Sometimes you can be lucky, and the exhaust leak can be fixed with a welder. This can solve your exhaust leak problem for free if you know how to do it yourself.Exhaust systems can often be replaced in sections without having to replace the entire system. This saves a lot of costs.Catalytic converters and DPF?s are often on the more expensive side of the scale, so if you can fix your leak without replacing these, that?s always a bonus."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad or Clogged Catalytic Converter ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad catalytic converter are a sulfur smell when the engine is warm and a check engine light on your dashboard. You may also notice engine performance issues like acceleration lag, higher or lower fuel consumption, and a misfiring engine.While these are not all possible symptoms, they are the most common ones. Here is a more detailed list of the signs of a bad or clogged catalytic converter to look for:1. Check Engine LightFlashing Check Engine LightThe check engine light, one of the most obvious indicators of a malfunction with your car, is also one of the strongest indicators of a bad catalytic converter. When checked with a compatible OBD scanner, it will show you a catalytic converter-related trouble code that must be decoded with the help of the operating manual.The most common trouble code when it comes to a bad catalytic converter is the P0420 code.2. Acceleration LagPoor AccelerationIf you observe delays when accelerating or a decrease in power when driving in steep areas while all other parts like spark plugs, filters, sensors, etc. are fine, then it could be the catalytic converter that?s bad.Mechanics often misdiagnose the symptoms of a faulty catalytic converter as being caused by a bad oxygen sensor or any other sensor.To check if your catalytic converter is clogged, keep your hand close to the exhaust pipe end and ask someone to push the accelerator pedal to increase your car?s RPM to 2000. If you get a meager amount of exhaust coming out, you might have a clogged catalytic converter. Compare the flow to a similar car if possible.3. High or low fuel consumptionBad Fuel ConsumptionBetter or worse gas mileage is one of the symptoms of a poor catalytic converter. While better gas mileage may sound like a good deal, it can damage your engine and may cause even more expensive repairs.Due to improper combustion of the fuel when the exhaust is clogged, it will make your car engine to be much less efficient and it needs to work harder for the same amount of power. Therefore, a bad catalytic converter will most often cause a higher fuel consumption, even if lower is possible in some cases.4. Smell of sulfurWhen the catalytic converter is clogged, it will restrict the airflow of exhaust fumes so that the engine?s air-fuel mixture will get rich (too much fuel, leading to unburnt fuel)The combustion of this excessive air-fuel mixture causes a smell like rotten eggs or burnt sulfur, which is an obvious indication of your catalytic converter?s malfunction.5. Discolored HousingIf you see that the catalytic converter?s housing has turned blue or some other color, it could mean that the catalytic converter is clogged and is creating excessive heat.This could also happen if your engine is not running as it should and unburnt fuel is entering the catalyst. This mixture then ignites in the converter due to the heat and melts its inner material, causing even more blockages.If your catalytic converter is clogged, it could also create excessive heat inside the engine, which could damage other parts quite quickly. Therefore, you should not drive your car if you suspect that the catalytic converter is bad.6. Starting IssuesIf the catalytic converter is clogged, the engine will get too much fuel that the engine cannot burn. It will also create back pressure which will cause the engine to struggle to get rid of the exhaust fumes.If your car starts for 2-3 seconds and then dies, it could definitely be caused by a clogged converter. This is because it may take 2-3 seconds for the pressure to rise in the exhaust system until the engine is choked and shuts off.7. Increased EmissionsIf your catalytic converter is damaged or clogged, there is a risk that the catalytic converter is not doing its job properly anymore. This will cause an increase in the car engine?s emissions. The overall purpose of the catalytic converter is to remove bad emissions, so this is probably quite obvious.You will often notice this by seeing dark exhaust smoke coming from your exhaust pipe during acceleration or at idle. If you have a yearly car inspection in the state or country you live in, your car will most likely fail an emission test or smog test.8. Engine MisfiresWhen the catalytic converter is clogged, it restricts the flow of oxygen in engines, and engines require a lot of oxygen for proper fuel combustion. This reduced airflow leads to overheating due to an excessive amount of unburned gases and may also lead to a misfiring engine.If your engine is misfiring, you should get it fixed as soon as possible, because it can lead to further expensive repairs if you just ignore it.9. Rattles or other noisesInside the catalytic converter, there is a ?honeycomb? that can get worn out and this can cause the honeycomb to break apart into pieces. This will cause a rattling noise from the catalytic converter when you rev your car engine.You can ask a friend to press the accelerator pedal while you try to listen under the car if the rattling noises are coming from the catalytic converter or somewhere else."
What is a catalytic converter?	"The catalytic converter is a device located in the exhaust system of a car. The catalytic converter consists of a catalyst that helps convert the car?s pollutant gases into less harmful pollutants. The structure of the catalytic converter has the look of a honeycomb.The honeycomb shape aims to ensure that the pollutant gases flow through the more exposed surface and converts Nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons into safer elements like carbon dioxide . Despite being one of the most expensive products, Platinum is normally used as a catalyst in catalytic converters. However, in some cases, rhodium and palladium are also used.Since combustion occurs in the engine, all the burnt gases flow at about 800 degrees through the exhaust pipe, which passes through the catalytic converter, thus affecting the engine?s exhaust gas flow. A perfect converter usually lasts up to 10 years. The honeycomb structure of the catalytic converter starts to suffocate slowly, which affects the engine?s performance."
What could damage a catalytic converter?	"Catalytic converters are often getting worn with time and it most likely has to get replaced one or more times during your car?s lifetime. Some car models even have a service schedule of when it should be replaced (Even if most people don?t follow this because of the expensive replacement cost).If your car engine is combusting motor oil, caused by worn piston rings or clogged crankcase ventilation, it could cause damages to the catalytic converter really fast. Other causes could be contaminants like unburned fuel caused by misfires. Coolant entering the combustion chamber by a blown head gasket could also cause damage to the honeycomb."
how to Catalytic Converter Theft ?	"Catalytic converters contain precious metals like small amounts of platinum, rhodium, and palladium. These metals are very attractive to thieves since scrap yards will pay well for a used catalytic converter.Catalytic converters are also relatively easy to steal because you just have to cut off the pipe with a tiger saw or something similar and it?s done in under 3 minutes. If you want to learn more about how to protect your catalytic converter from getting stolen you can check out our other article: How To Protect Your Car Against Catalytic Converter Theft"
where the Catalytic Converter Location ?	"The catalytic converter is located on the exhaust pipe system, between your muffler and the exhaust pipe manifold.Depending on the car engine, the distance where it?s installed from the engine could differ a lot. On some engines, the catalytic converter is installed directly on the exhaust manifold, while on others it could be installed almost in the middle of the exhaust pipe."
Catalytic Converter Replacement cost?	"Replacing or repairing the catalytic converter is often very expensive and often not worth the cost, if your car is old. There are some workshops that replace the honeycomb inside the catalytic converter and keep the outer parts. This could be worth on some expensive catalytic converters, but in most cases, it?s easier and cheaper to just buy a new one.The average catalytic converter replacement cost is between $400 and $2500. You can learn more about the replacement costs here: Catalytic converter replacement cost."
Can a bad catalytic converter ruin your engine?	"Yes, it can but it is more likely that your engine will just shut off and not run until you fix the damaged catalytic converter. A clogged or damaged catalytic can create high backpressure into the engine which can damage other parts of your car?s engine or emission system, which could lead to severe engine failure."
What is the average life of a catalytic converter?	"The average lifespan of a catalytic converter is roughly ten years or 100,000 miles. However, there are many factors that can affect the lifespan of a catalytic converter such as the quality of the converter, the type of vehicle it?s in, and how well the vehicle is maintained. Many catalytic converters will last the life of the car, while others have a scheduled service for when the catalytic converter is to be replaced."
What does a bad catalytic converter sound like?	"If you can hear a rattling noise coming from the catalytic converter it can mean it?s bad. However, unfortunately, there isn?t necessarily one specific sound from the exhaust that indicates a problem with the catalytic converter."
How do I fix a catalytic converter without replacing it?	How do you fix a catalytic converter without replacing it?
how to Test A Catalytic Converter ?	"A catalytic converter is an important component of a vehicle's emissions control system that converts harmful pollutants in the exhaust gas into less harmful substances. Here are the steps to test a catalytic converter:Start the engine and let it idle for a few minutes to allow the catalytic converter to heat up.Use a temperature gun to measure the temperature of the exhaust gas entering the catalytic converter.Measure the temperature of the exhaust gas exiting the catalytic converter.Compare the temperature readings with the manufacturer's specifications for the particular catalytic converter being tested.Use an emissions analyzer to measure the level of pollutants in the exhaust gas entering and exiting the catalytic converter.Compare the emissions readings with the manufacturer's specifications for the particular catalytic converter being tested.If the temperature and emissions readings are outside the manufacturer's specifications, the catalytic converter may need to be replaced.Overall, it's important to perform regular testing and maintenance on the catalytic converter to ensure that it's working properly and efficiently, and to avoid any potential issues that may cause damage to the engine or increase emissions."
What is Bank 1 vs. Bank 2? 	"Bank 1 and bank 2 simply refer to either side of the engine. Bank 1 is on the side with cylinder 1. Bank 2 is the side with cylinder 2. Most commonly, Bank 1 is towards the front of the car if it has a transverse engine.The easiest way to discover the right cylinder bank is to check your car?s repair manual. You can also try to find any stamps on the cylinder block or head for any cylinder numbers.The front of the engine is the part where the crankshaft pulley is. The side nearest the front is not the front of the engine.You can?t simplify it and say that bank 1 is on the driver?s side or vice versa, because different engines can have cylinder 1 on different sides. We drive on different sides globally, so it?s just confusing and misleading to guess which side bank 1 or bank 2 is on.Bank 1 is the side with cylinder number 1 (Cylinders 1 ? 3 ? 5 ? 7 etc.)Bank 2 is the side with cylinder number 2 (Cylinders 2 ? 4 ? 6 ? 8 etc.)Bank 1 Vs Bank 2"
What is Sensor 1 & 2?	"The sensor number tells us where on the exhaust system the O2 sensor or the exhaust temperature sensor is installed.The 1st sensor is located closest to the engine, and the last is located toward the rear of the exhaust system.Generally, if we are talking about O2 sensors:Sensor 1 = Before Catalytic converter Front (Upstream O2 sensor)Sensor 2 = After Catalytic Converter Rear (Downstream O2 sensor)Some diesel engines have many exhaust temperature sensors, and they can use sensors 1 ? 2 ? 3 ? 4, etc. In this case, sensor 1 is nearest to the engine, and the last sensor is in the exhaust system?s rear."
Are bank 1 and bank 2 sensors the same?	"In most cases, the sensors on bank 1 or bank 2 are the same. However, this is completely dependent on the car model and which sensor we are talking about. Check a repair manual or ask a dealer for the right answer for your car model."
Is bank 1 driver or passenger side?	"No. Bank 1 refers to the side of the engine with cylinder 1. While it is often true that bank 1 is located on the driver?s side, this is not always the case. You will only waste your money by using this method instead of checking it properly."
Is bank 2 front or rear?	"The bank has nothing to do with the front or back of the engine, even if your engine is transversely mounted. Bank 1 is the side with cylinder one and bank 2 is the side with cylinder two. Sensor 1 and sensor 2 are telling us if it?s the front or rear O2 sensor."
Is bank 1 on the exhaust or intake side?	"Bank 1 or Bank 2 has nothing to do with the exhaust or intake side, so it all depends on what engine you have. Bank 1 is the side with cylinder 1 and bank 2 is the side with cylinder 2."
Conclusion	"All the information about different banks and sensor locations can be confusing for most people, but it?s actually quite logical if you just know the basics. So to answer most of the questions people have about different banks and sensors, we?re going to summarize the different O2 sensor locations here:"
Where is the Bank 1 Sensor 1 Located?	"Bank 1 Sensor 1 is the first sensor closest to the engine (Upstream) on Bank 1. Bank 1 means it is at the side of the engine with cylinder numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, etc."
Where is the Bank 1 Sensor 2 Located?	"Bank 1 Sensor 2 is the second sensor on the engine?s exhaust pipe (Downstream) on Bank 1, usually behind the catalytic converter. Bank 1 means it is at the engine side with cylinder numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, etc."
Where is the Bank 2 Sensor 1 Located?	"Bank 2 Sensor 1 is the first sensor closest to the engine (Upstream) on Bank 2. Bank 2 means it is at the side of the engine with cylinder numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, etc."
Where is the Bank 2 Sensor 2 Located?	"Bank 2 Sensor 2 is the second sensor on the engine?s exhaust pipe (Downstream) on Bank 2, usually behind the catalytic converter. Bank 2 means it is at the engine side with cylinder numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.I hope you enjoyed this article and now have the knowledge to determine which O2 sensor you should replace to fix your car issue.

How Hot Does A Car Exhaust System Get? 	"The temperature within the exhaust system can range from 300 to 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on which part you are looking at. However, the average temperature of the muffler or exhaust pipe is usually between 300 and 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Here is a more detailed list of the temperatures of the different exhaust parts:1. Exhaust ManifoldExhaust ManifoldWhen the gases are coming out of the engine, they are at their hottest point. This is where the gases could easily reach 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit, especially if you are pushing the vehicle hard.The closer you get to the cylinder heads, the hotter the gases will be. As they move away from the engine, they start to cool off slightly. 2. MufflerEven though the muffler is near the end of the exhaust system, it still remains quite hot. In fact, most mufflers can reach temperatures between 300 and 500 degrees Fahrenheit. The higher the RPMs of your engine, the hotter the gases are going to be. Because of these extreme temperatures, you must use caution when replacing or fixing a muffler. 3. Catalytic ConverterBecause there is a chemical reaction taking place in the catalytic converter, this part has a higher temperature reading. You can expect most catalytic converters to reach around 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.However, when the converter becomes overheated, or if unburnt gases travel through, the temperature can rise significantly. In fact, overheated converters can reach over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit and turn bright red. 4. Oxygen SensorsThe oxygen sensors are located throughout the exhaust system. Depending on what location you are looking at, the temperature can vary greatly. At the point of leaving the engine, the first oxygen sensor is going to deal with the most extreme heat. However, the sensors after the catalytic converter doesn?t have it easy either, especially if the converter is overheated. "
Factors Affecting Heat from Exhaust System ?	"1. ConditionThe condition of both the engine and exhaust system makes a huge difference in the temperatures you can expect. If the exhaust system is dealing with any constrictions, it will cause the temperatures to rise.Additionally, the harder the engine has to work to produce power, the hotter the gases become. If the engine is overheating for any reason, the gases could exceed normal operating temperatures. 2. Engine SpeedThe gases are produced from the combustion of the engine. The faster the vehicle moves, the more the engine must work, which means extra gases are moving through the pipes.You are going to notice a big difference between the temperatures of the gases when the engine is running at 800 RPMs versus 1800 RPMs. In fact, if you are simply idling the engine, the pipes won?t get nearly as hot as they do when you are driving your vehicle. 3. Pipe Length & DesignEvery exhaust system features a different design and pipe diameter. The length and width of these pipes affect how cool or hot the exhaust gets. The further the exhaust gases need to travel, the more heat becomes lost in the process. However, if the gases don?t have far to travel, the gas is going to come out hotter, resulting in higher pipe temperatures."
What is the Exhaust System?	"The main purpose of the exhaust system is to remove the gases from the engine. However, it?s also needed to reduce noise and improve the performance of the motor. The exhaust system is made up of several components, including the manifold, catalytic converter, resonator, oxygen sensors, muffler, tail pipe and exhaust pipe. The exhaust system begins at the exhaust manifold. This is where the gases from the engine are collected and directed away from the motor. Typically, the exhaust manifold is made from cast iron, designed to handle the hot fumes coming from the engine. Many manifolds contain multiple cylinders that remove the gases and route them into a single cylinder, known as the front pipe.There will be an oxygen sensor in the beginning of the exhaust system, measuring the level of oxygen in the gas. This information is sent back to the ECU to determine how much fuel must be injected into the engine for proper combustion.The exhaust gases then go through the catalytic converter, where a chemical reaction occurs to reduce toxicity. After this, there should be another oxygen sensor that compares how much oxygen is in the gases with the first reading. This sensor is responsible for making sure the catalytic converter is doing its job. The altered gases move through the resonator, which changes the sounds coming out of the engine. These fumes hit the muffler, which also reduces the sound of the exhaust, based on what kind of chambers it has and what material is used for the construction. At the end of the line, the gases move into the atmosphere through the tail pipe. "
Reasons For White Smoke Coming from the Exhaust Pipe ?	"The most common cause of white smoke coming from the exhaust is condensation from the exhaust system. It can also be caused by a leaking intake manifold gasket, a bad EGR cooler, a blown head gasket, or a cracked cylinder head.White smoke can either be very light, just like a vapor, or it can be dense and heavy smoke. White smoke from the exhaust pipe during startup, idle, or acceleration tells us that coolant or water is getting vaporized in the exhaust pipe.You can also carefully smell the water or smoke from the exhaust; if it smells sweet, it?s most likely coolant, and in this case, you have a bigger problem.Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes of white smoke from the exhaust pipe:1. CondensationWhite Smoke From ExhaustThe most common reason for white smoke from the exhaust pipe is condensed water that is getting vaporized.When your car is standing for a long time and hasn?t been used for a day or two, there will be condensation left over from the last time your car was driven.This water will lay in the bottom of your exhaust, and once you start the car, the exhaust will get hot and then vaporize the condense.If the white smoke is light and only comes for a short time after the starting moment at cold starts, there should be nothing to worry about. It?s most likely just condensation.2. Leaking Intake Manifold GasketBad Intake Manifold GasketThis next problem is more serious, but still not too bad. Your intake manifold is the part that divides the air going into the cylinders of your car.Intake manifolds are often cooled by coolant fluid, and therefore they have a gasket between the intake manifold and the cylinder head. Sometimes, the gasket goes bad and starts to leak.If you have a bad intake manifold gasket, you will often smell sweet smoke from the exhaust gases.3. Bad EGR CoolerVolkswagen Egr CoolerIf your exhaust smoke smells sweet, it?s most likely a condensed coolant you are facing.One more common cause of this on modern vehicles is a crack inside the EGR cooler. Not all cars have EGR coolers, though, and it is more common on European cars, but it is definitely worth checking.This can be pretty difficult to diagnose properly as there are no signs you can look for outside the engine.However, if the EGR cooler is cracked, it has to get replaced. If you suspect that your EGR cooler is faulty, you may have to get help from a mechanic to diagnose it properly.The best way is to check inside your cylinders and spark plugs. If the car is combusting coolant, it will clean the cylinders. So if no of the cylinders is cleaned, but the car is still burning coolant, it must come from after the combustion chambers, like from the EGR cooler.4. Blown Head GasketHead GasketThe head gasket is a gasket placed between the engine block and the cylinder head. This gasket separates combustion, oil, and coolant between these two parts.When the head gasket is either damaged or cracked, it can cause coolant to leak into the combustion chambers. The opposite can also happen.This can cause the engine to combust coolant, and it will result in heavy white smoke from your exhaust, depending on the size of the leak.Unfortunately, a blown head gasket is often very expensive to repair because you have to disassemble many parts to replace it.If you want to go further into bad head gasket diagnosing, check out our other article here: Bad Head Gasket Symptoms.5. Cracked Cylinder Head or BlockCylinder HeadAnother not-so-funny thing that can cause white smoke from your exhaust pipe is a cracked cylinder head or engine block. The engine block and the cylinder head are full of channels where the coolant flows to cool the engine down.If you are very unlucky, the engine block or cylinder head may have cracked, and this can cause coolant to flow into the combustion chamber or out through the exhaust.This is very rare, though, and usually only happens after an overheating engine or something similar. It can happen, though, and it occurs more on some engine models than others.To fix these problems, you often have to replace the whole head or block, which results in a complete disassembly of the engine.6. Too Rich Fuel MixtureSmoke From ExhaustOne thing that does not directly cause white smoke from the exhaust, but can be mistaken for it, is a too rich fuel mixture. This is not directly causing white smoke, but it is causing gray smoke, which can easily be mistaken for white smoke.A rich mixture causes gray smoke, and a rich mixture is most often caused by faulty fuel injectors, a faulty MAF sensor, or faulty O2 sensors"
How to Diagnose a Car With White Smoke from the Exhaust ?	"There are several ways to diagnose a car with white smoke. However, some methods are easier and faster than others.Smell the SmokeThe first thing you should do is taste or smell the smoke coming from the exhaust pipe. If it has a sweet smell, it?s coolant.If the smoke doesn?t smell or taste like anything more than water, it?s most likely condensation, and the smoke will go away after the car is heated up.Use a Pressure TesterThe best ? and, in my opinion, only ? way to find internal coolant leaks is with a coolant pressure tester. You fit it on your radiator cap, put pressure inside the coolant system, and let it stand for an hour.Remove the spark plugs or glow plugs and check for any signs of coolant leaks entering the combustion chamber. If you notice coolant, you might have a problem with your head gasket or a cracked cylinder head.If you can?t find any coolant there, remove the pipes to the EGR pipes and check for any coolant signs inside of them. If you notice coolant, there is most likely a crack in the EGR cooler, and you have to replace it."
Can I drive a car with white smoke from the exhaust?	"Whether you can drive your car with white smoke from the exhaust or not depends on how much smoke is coming from the exhaust. If you only notice white smoke when the engine is cold during start-up, it is most likely just caused by condensation. If there is always thick white smoke pouring out of the exhaust, it may be due to a bad head gasket, and you should not continue to drive the car."
What does white smoke from the tailpipe usually indicate?	"White smoke from the exhaust pipe usually indicates either that the car is cold and condensation is evaporating in the exhaust pipe, or that there is a problem with water or coolant being combusted in the cylinders."
Why is white smoke coming out of my exhaust but not overheating?	"If your car has white smoke coming from the exhaust pipe, but is not overheating, it could either be because there is nothing wrong with your car and it is just condensation coming from the pipe. It can also be caused if your EGR valve is leaking coolant into the exhaust pipe."
What color should exhaust smoke be?	"Exhaust smoke should be slightly grey. If the exhaust smoke is white, it may mean that water or coolant is being combusted. If it is blue, it may mean that oil is burnt in the cylinders. If it?s black, it could mean your engine is running rich."
Things to consider before starting ?	"There are some things that you have to consider before trying to clean your catalytic converter. In a lot of cases, the parts inside the catalytic converter will become loose. If this is the case, you can?t repair your catalytic converter without removing and replacing it.1. Too cloggedIf your catalytic converter is so clogged that the engine will not run, you have to remove the catalytic converter and either use special tools or replace the whole catalytic converter.2. Check/listen for loose partsYou can take a rubber hammer and hit your catalytic converter carefully and listen to ascertain if there seem to be any loose parts inside it. If you can hear loose parts, I recommend removing and inspecting the catalytic converter because the loose parts could come even looser and completely clog your exhaust pipe, which may cause your vehicle to stop while driving.Clogged Catalytic ConverterA clogged piece from the catalytic converter. If you find a piece like this in the exhaust system, it?s time to replace the catalytic converter.3. Purified catalystRemember that your catalytic converter may have been cleaned inside, and the parts inside it may have blown out from the exhaust pipe. This can be tough to see without removing it. If you suspect this is the case, you should remove the catalytic converter and check it.4. Oil consumptionYour catalytic converter may have gotten clogged due to excessive internal oil consumption, caused by oil entering the cylinders and getting combusted and burned inside the hot catalytic converter.If this is the case, you should always repair the internal oil leak before proceeding, as it may only work for a short time until the catalytic converter is clogged again. Common symptoms of an internal oil leak are clogged crankcase ventilation, broken valve seals, or piston rings. Always check the crankcase ventilation first."
How to Clean A Catalytic Converter Without Removing It	"If you have checked and listened carefully for any loose parts inside your catalytic converter and you are sure that the car is not burning oil, follow these few steps to clean your catalytic converter without removing it.Total Time: 10 minutesStep 1.

"The Oxicat did not work for me, what to do now?"	"If you tried the Oxicat catalytic converter cleaner but the problem still persists, there is not much more to do than remove the catalytic converter to inspect it and ensure it looks okay. Remember that there can be other causes of the P0420 trouble code like faulty O2 sensors or exhaust leaks and the problem may not be in your catalytic converter.Removing the catalytic converter is often quite easy on most cars if you can get the rusty bolts loose. In some cars, the catalytic converters are installed directly on the turbocharger, and in these cases, the removal of the catalytic converter may be more difficult.If you still think your catalytic converter is clogged and looks okay while inspecting it, you can try cleaning it in a bath with water and lacquer thinner. This does sometimes work, and it may save you some money.If you tried both the Oxicat cleaner and lacquer thinner, and you can not see any visual signs of damages, but the problem still insists, you have no option other than to replace the catalytic converter.You should also check for other problems. It might not be the catalytic converter that is causing your problem.Catalytic converters are often expensive, and this is because there are noble metals inside them that cost a lot to produce."
Does premium gas clean a catalytic converter?	"While premium gas likely won?t clean your catalytic converter, it can prevent it from becoming clogged in the first place. However, there are many reasons why a catalytic converter can become clogged, so it does not necessarily have to do with the fuel."
Can I drive with a clogged catalytic converter?	"Driving with a clogged catalytic converter is not recommended, and it depends on how clogged it is. A clogged catalytic converter will make your car run poorly and will increase your emissions. If you suspect your catalytic converter is clogged, take your car to a mechanic for a checkup. Driving with a clogged catalytic converter can also cause severe damage to other parts of the engine."
What is the best way to clean a catalytic converter?	"The best way to clean a catalytic converter is to remove it from the vehicle and use a special machine to clean it with a good cleaning fluid. However, these are very expensive and are for commercial use."
Is it better to clean or replace the catalytic converter?	"Replacing the catalytic converter with a new one is definitely the best way to avoid problems in the future.

Reasons Why Your Car Won?t Go In Reverse ?	"Depending on whether you have an automatic or manual car, the fluid could be low or contaminated, a shift solenoid could be bad, a sensor might have failed, or there?s a faulty valve body. It could also be a bad gear shifter mechanism, a shifter cable, broken gear teeth, or a clutch that?s to blame. By examining each possibility, you can see which reason best fits what you are experiencing. 1. Low or Dirty Transmission Fluid Level (Automatic)Transmission Fluid DipstickIf you drive an automatic transmission car, the fluid is imperative to keeping everything running smoothly. It must lubricate the transmission and keep the components from creating friction. When the fluid runs low, the transmission may no longer be able to shift into Reverse. You should also notice trouble getting into any gear. Because the transmission is a sealed system, you shouldn?t be low on fluid. You may be dealing with a leak that requires repair. Fluid can leak from the pump or any of the hoses. Additionally, contaminated fluid is just as dangerous as when it?s low. If the fluid is burnt or old, it can no longer provide the support needed for gears to shift, causing you trouble when you try to put the car in Reverse. 2. Bad Shift Solenoid (Automatic)Symptoms Of A Bad Shift SolenoidNormally speaking, a bad shift solenoid will cause trouble with upshifts as well as Reverse, but it?s not impossible to only have trouble backing up. In fact, this problem has been common with the FNR5 transmission. The transmission shift solenoids are designed to control fluid flow. When trouble arises, you may have the Reverse problem, as well as delayed or unpredictable shifting patterns. 3. Transmission Range Sensor (Automatic)Transmission Range SensorThe transmission range sensor monitors the speed of this vital component. This data is used to regulate shifting pressure during gear changes and it helps the computer decide what gear is to be engaged. With a faulty sensor, the system may not know to go into Reverse. It could also cause problems with getting into other gears, especially over third. 4. Gear Lever Sensor (Automatic)Car ShifterThis sensor is responsible for telling the car what gear the shifter is in. To start a car, the gear shifter must be located in the Park or Neutral spot, which is why cars have a lever sensor. When the sensor fails, the car may not shift into Reverse or it could shift into a gear you haven?t chosen. It can also prevent the vehicle from starting if the data isn?t transferred that the car is in Park or Neutral. 5. Faulty Valve Body (Automatic)Transmission Valve BodyWith the automatic transmission, the valve body is responsible for directing hydraulic fluid to the valves. It resembles a maze, pushing fluid through a particular set o passageways when it?s needed. However, if there?s an obstruction, shifting could be delayed or erratic.In most cases, you?ll notice a problem across the board with shifting. However, some valve bodies contain a reverse-inhibit function that leads to just trouble with the Reverse gear. We?ve seen this happen with both the JF506 transmission, as well as the GM 5L40 transmissions. 6. Faulty Gear Shifter Mechanism (Manual)Manual ShifterManual cars have shift mechanisms that are different from an automatic. These shift linkages connect the transmission to the gear shifter. The shift linkage can become misadjusted or faulty in a manual car. Thankfully, some of the shifter mechanisms are adjustable. We will discuss more about those procedures in a minute. It can also fail completely because it becomes worn or broken. 7. Faulty Shifter Cables (Manual)The shifter cable is another part that may require adjustment. When the shifter cable becomes stretched and needs to be replaced, you may hear a grinding sound. You?ll also know that the cable is stretched because there will be a lot of play in the shifter. When the horizontal cable breaks, you can?t shift. However, if the vertical cable breaks, you will only be able to get into a couple of gears, normally the third and fourth. 8. Bad Clutch (Manual)Clutch LocationIt?s also possible that the clutch is the cause, but you would probably have other symptoms. For example, all shifting becomes difficult when the clutch fails.You may also hear a grinding sound when shifting gears and the clutch starts to smell. A soft spongy clutch pedal should also be a warning sign that something?s wrong. Manual transmission clutches can last 100,000 miles or more if you are easy on them. 9. Broken Teeth on Reverse Gear (Manual)It?s possible for the Reverse gear to break. While it?s not as common as some other options, you don?t want to overlook the possibility. Wear and tear is the most common cause of gear breakage. When this happens, the car will go in every other gear without problems but cannot be put into Reverse. In fact, the transmission should continue to operate normally other than with Reverse. "
How To Fix A Car That Won?t Go In Reverse ?	"Even if you aren?t a professional mechanic, you can still diagnose and repair your car the same way we do. Here are some steps to follow. 1. Check The Transmission Fluid LevelIt?s easy to check the transmission fluid in most car models. However, we recommend using a repair manual for your particular car model. Here?s how to check the transmission fluid in most car models.Park the vehicle on a level surface and engage the parking brake.Start the car engine and let it run for a few minutes. Keep the shifter in Neutral or Park. (Some cars require the engine to be off for a check. Reference your owner?s manual to be sure).Pull out the fluid dipstick. It?s usually near where the transmission meets the rear of the engine. Be careful, the fluid may be hot.Wipe the dipstick off on a shop rage and put it back in the tube.Remove it again and observe the markings in relation to the fluid level. If the fluid doesn?t reach the Full Warm line, you need to add more. If the fluid is low, you should also look for leaks. Check the system and repair any leaks you find.  2. Read Codes from TCMRead Trouble CodesSome code scanners will read DTCs from the Transmission Control Module (TCM). If you have one, plug it into the OBDII port and see if any codes can help that let you determine the problem.While some codes are generic, others will pinpoint the exact issue. Use our trouble code library to decipher the information. 3. Flush Transmission FluidIf you noticed that the transmission fluid looked old or burnt, a flush might help. However, not all manufacturers recommend flushing and some sealed transmissions are only to be serviced by the dealer. Look that information up in the owner?s manual before proceeding.If you are going to change the fluid, make sure you have all of your supplies ahead of time. Don?t forget to take the fluid to a location that will dispose of it properly. Many auto parts stores offer this service for free. 4. Verify Data From Transmission Range and Gear Level SensorWith your compatible code scanner, you may also be able to check the data on the various sensors. Compare the readings with what?s in the factory service manual to see if something is wrong. It?s also possible that one of these sensors is simply contaminated. If that?s the case, you should be able to clean it off and reinstall it. 5. Inspect Shifter Mechanism and Cables (Manual)If you have a manual transmission car, you may need to adjust the shifter mechanism and cable. The steps to do this can be found in your service manual. Additionally, you should check the clutch. If you can get your car into Reverse when the car is off but not on, chances are the clutch is the problem. Thankfully, it?s easier to replace a clutch than to repair a transmission. 6. Contact A ProfessionalYou aren?t expected to know everything there is to know about transmissions. Some of the steps and data we provided can be overwhelming.If you need more help completing any of these procedures or performing a repair, don?t hesitate to call a professional. By spending a little more money, you can have peace of mind that the job was done right. "
Why is my car not moving when I put it in drive or reverse?	"It?s possible that the fluid is low or has gotten contaminated. There could also be a mechanical problem, such as a bad shift solenoid, failed sensor, faulty valve body, malfunctioning gear shifter mechanism, a loose shifter cable, a bad clutch or broken gear teeth. "
How much does it cost to fix a transmission?	"It depends on what needs to be done. Adding more fluid may only cost you $10 to $25 while fixing the transmission could easily turn into a $2,000 or more bill. Start with an expert diagnosis, so you aren?t replacing parts that still work as intended. "
What are the signs of low transmission fluid?	"You may hear strange noises, especially during shift changes. There could also be a burning smell or fluid leaking under the vehicle. Eventually, gears will start to slip or not function at all. The Check Engine Light or transmission warning indicator will also be present on the dash once the situation becomes severe. "
What is a reverse lockout?	"The Reverse lockout function on a car keeps you from shifting into Reverse while you are driving at a certain speed. It can be found in both automatic and manual cars. If you were able to put your car into Reverse while driving, it could lead to serious engine and transmission damage."
Conclusion	"If your car has stopped going into Reverse, you don?t want to continue driving. It?s important to get the problem checked out right away. Otherwise, you could end up with massive engine or transmission repair bills. There?s a good possibility that the problem is small and you can repair it without a lot of money lost. However, you won?t have that chance if you procrastinate. The problems will only get worse, leading to more expensive repair bills and additional places you can?t drive to because you don?t have a Reverse gear."
Reasons Your Car Won?t Accelerate But RPMs Go Up ?	"When a gas pedal is pushed down, the car is meant to accelerate. If it doesn?t, it could mean the transmission is slipping, or you have a bad torque converter. It?s also caused by bad shift solenoids, a worn clutch, a damaged gearbox or various drivetrain problems. 1. Slipping Transmission (Automatic)Transmission Slipping CausesWhen a transmission slips, it means that it can?t shift or engage gears the way it normally would. The slipping transmission is a broad term usually indicating that there?s something deeper happening within.The cause for a slipping transmission can vary, with problems as simple as not having enough transmission fluid. Even burnt transmission fluid can be to blame, which is normally caused by overheating.Aside from these problems, the clutches in the transmission may be worn. Additionally, many of the other problems we are about to discuss can also cause a slipping transmission. 2. Bad Torque Converter (Automatic) Torque Converter Bench E1614183819112The torque converter is needed to transform the mechanical power coming from the engine into hydraulic power needed for the drivetrain. When it starts to fail, you can feel a shuddering sensation from the transmission. It also causes the RPMs to rise without any acceleration.With a failing torque converter, the right amount of power won?t get to the transmission. Therefore, even though the RPMs continue to rise, you?ll have trouble getting the speed you should. 3. Bad Shift Solenoids (Automatic)Transmission Shift SolenoidThe shift solenoid controls the flow of fluid in the transmission. The transmission control module (TCM) sends out an electrical signal that tells the solenoids when to transfer fluid. If there?s a problem with the solenoid or a circuit, the Check Engine Light should come on. You?ll also notice erratic shifting, slipping or the inability to gain RPMs. Additionally, the car could go into a Limp Mode to prevent further damage from occurring. 4. Worn Clutch (Manual)Symptoms Of A Slipping ClutchDo you drive a car with a manual transmission? If so, the problem could be related to the clutch. After driving many miles, the clutch is eventually going to give out.As the clutch disc wears, the transmission starts to slip. It can also feel unresponsive when you step on the gas pedal. 5. Damaged Gearbox (Manual)Damaged GearboxAs the manual gearbox begins to fail, you are going to notice many of the same problems as found with an automatic transmission. There could be odd noises or an alarming grinding sound.It?s also possible that the transmission could become stuck in one gear. Additionally, if you can?t get the car into gear or you notice a lot of fluid leakage, there?s probably something wrong with the gearbox.6. Drivetrain ProblemsDriveshaft WheelIf the issue isn?t with the transmission or related parts, the drivetrain could be to blame. For example, there could be a broken axle shaft that won?t permit motion to the wheels. Drivetrain issues usually present with some form of vibration or shaking before leading to trouble moving the vehicle at all. You may also hear some clunking or grinding, making it difficult to differentiate the issues from the transmission. "
How To Fix A Car That Won?t Accelerate But RPMs Go Up ?	"Once you realize there?s a problem with your car, you want to take swift action. Many problems are simple to correct, but procrastinating could ruin your transmission. For many of these tasks, you only need a few simple tools and some basic mechanical knowledge. Here are the steps we recommend. 1. Check Transmission Fluid Level (Automatic)Check Transmission Fluid LevelNot all vehicles have a transmission that can be checked. Some modern vehicles contain sealed transmissions that are only meant to be serviced by the dealer. If you can check your transmission fluid, here are the steps to follow. Park on a level surface.Put on the parking brake.Start the engine.With your car in Park, let the engine warm up unless the owner?s manual tells you something different.Find the transmission fluid dipstick, usually near the transmission meets up with the engine. It resembles an oil dipstick. Remove the dipstick and wipe it clean. Be cautious, as the fluid is hot.Pull the dipstick back out again and observe where the fluid is in relation to the markings. There could be two markings for FULL, one for cold and another for warm. If the fluid isn?t reaching the FULL warm line, you need to add more fluid.Put a funnel into the fill hole and add a small amount of fluid. Recheck the levels until it reaches the appropriate line.It?s very important that you only use compatible transmission fluid. Check the owner?s manual to be sure you purchase the right kind for your vehicle. 2. Change Transmission Fluid (Automatic)Transmission Fluid ChangeThe car?s transmission fluid may need to be changed every 60,000 to 100,000 miles, depending on the recommendations of the manufacturer. Additionally, not every manufacturer offers a serviceable transmission, so you may not be able to change the fluid yourself. If you can, follow these steps.Park the vehicle on a flat surface.Place wheel chocks behind the back wheels.Carefully lift the vehicle with a floor jack.Secure the vehicle with jack stands.Locate the transmission fluid pan. It?s flat and broad, found at the bottom of the transmission, typically secured with numerous bolts. If the transmission pan contains a drain plug, you can remove it just like you do when changing your oil. A crescent or socket wrench will be needed to loosen the plug.Allow the fluid to drain in a large container. Inspect the fluid for any signs of metal. If you see large pieces, you may want to have a technician inspect the fluid. Replace the transmission fluid filter. The pan needs to come off to get to it. Put the pan back on, but don?t over-tighten the bolts.Reinstall the drain plug.Refill the transmission fluid with the right type. Keep filling until the system is full.Gently lower the vehicle back down to the ground and run the engine, carefully watching for any leaks. Remember to dispose of your old fluid properly. Many auto parts stores offer free fluid recycling; you just need to see what?s available in your area. The fluid change process may differ depending on your car model, so it?s important that you follow the steps for your particular car model with a repair manual.3. Check Trouble Codes In TCM (Automatic)Diagnose CarIf the Check Engine Light or Transmission light is on, there should be a diagnostic code set in the computer. All gas-powered vehicles, 1996 and newer, have the OBDII system installed. With a compatible code reader, you can read this information. Plug in the scanner to see what codes come out. You can use our trouble code library to diagnose the problem and repair the fault. 4. Diagnose The Clutch System (Manual)If you understand the manual transmission, you can attempt to diagnose the clutch yourself. Here are a few things to consider.If the clutch doesn?t disengage at all, the linkage or cable may have broken or there?s a bad slave cylinder. It could also be a throwout bearing, the pressure plate diaphragm or a failed friction plate. However, if the clutch slips under a load, there is often not much to adjust or fix, you may have a worn flywheel friction surface and a bad clutch disc. There could also be a seal leaking. 5. Diagnose The DrivetrainTroubleshooting the drivetrain can be a little more complicated. Start by providing a visual inspection of all the components to see if anything is worn. Beyond this, it?s best to follow the procedures laid out in your service manual. Troubleshooting can be specific to the manufacturer. 6. Contact A ProfessionalThere?s a good chance that these problems are going to be too difficult to resolve. If it?s not as simple as adding or changing transmission fluid, you may need more help. Reach out to a local technician in your area that specializes in transmission repair. By paying someone else to handle the problem, you can dramatically cut back on your downtime. "
Why is my car revving high but going slow?	"There?s probably something wrong with the transmission or drivetrain. It could be a slipping transmission, a bad torque converter, failing shift solenoids, a worn-out clutch or damage to the gearbox. Walk through some diagnostic steps and resolve the issue before the transmission is permanently damaged."
What are the signs your transmission is going out?	"The transmission may start to slip, as though it can?t find the appropriate gear. It can also shudder or shake while driving. On top of that, you may start to hear strange noises, including grinding. There?s even the chance that the Check Engine Light or transmission light may come on. "
What can be mistaken for transmission problems?	"Anything affecting the engine can cause trouble with the transmission. For example, if the catalytic converter is clogged, the engine has to work harder, putting more stress on the transmission. A faulty sensor or a dirty fuel filter or injector can also cause sticking gears in severe cases. "
Should I change the transmission filter or just the fluid?	"The transmission fluid typically only needs to be changed every 60,000 to 100,000 miles. When you change the fluid, you should also change the filter. However, changing the filter does require an extra step because you will need to drop the pan instead of simply pulling the plug. "
Can low transmission fluid cause no acceleration?	"Yes, if the transmission fluid drops too low, hydraulic pressure can?t be generated to the normal degree. This problem leads to slipping gears, which produces trouble accelerating normally. You will see the RPMs go up, but the car doesn?t gain speed when you press the accelerator. "
Conclusion	"It?s alarming when the car won?t accelerate, but the RPMs continue to rise. If you aren?t used to seeing this issue as we are, you could panic. However, it?s best to drive home carefully and have the problem diagnosed as soon as possible. Whether there?s an issue with the transmission or the drivetrain, you can get it repaired and get back on the road. Just be sure you act promptly to avoid any further component damage."
what are the Manual Transmission Jumps Out of Gear Causes ?	"The manual transmission can jump out of gear because of worn mounts or loose linkage. It?s also caused by bad shifter bearings or a weak spring in the shift rail. The worst-case scenario is that something is internally wrong with the transmission, requiring a rebuild or replacement. Here is a more detailed list of the reasons why a manual transmission pops out of gear:1. Worn MountsTransmission MountThe transmission mounts will wear over time. When this happens, the transmission can move every time the car accelerates.If the transmission moves too much, it can move the shifter linkage so much that it will stretch the cable. This situation would leave it out of gear.2. Loose LinkageAs the car ages, the linkage rods can also become loose. The rods are needed to connect the transmission and the gear shifter. When the rods are loose, it becomes more difficult to keep the transmission locked in gear.Stretched-out linkage can also be caused when the transmission mount is worn. In some cases, you can readjust the linkage, but most times, it needs to be replaced. 3. Bad Shifter BearingIf the bearings around the gear shifter itself become worn, there will be too much play in the gear lever to engage the gear completely. If your shifter feels very loose, it may indicate worn bearings.When the gears aren?t pressed together securely, they can slip. Because of this, the car will drop into neutral while you are driving.RELATED: 6 Causes of Manual Transmission Hard to Shift (Especially 1st to 2nd)4. Weak Spring in Shift RailInside the shift rail of internal linkage, there?s a spring that locks the transmission into gear. If this spring becomes weak or it breaks, you might notice trouble.When the spring fails, the shifter ball can slip out of its spot. When the shifter moves unexpectedly, the transmission can also slip out of gear. 5. Internal FailureManual Transmission Internal PartsThe manual transmission contains numerous internal components that can fail as a result of abuse or age. If the transmission keeps popping out of gear, the problem could be something larger, such as the shift fork assembly or the synchronizer.With a bad synchronizer, the transmission typically only pops out of certain gears. It might also cause trouble downshifting into those gears. However, the gears can also be to blame. If the gears are worn out, you will need to have them replaced. "
Adjusting a Manual Transmission ?	"In some cases, it?s possible to adjust the manual transmission for better performance. However, the directions for this can vary by model, so you always want to reference the service manual for your transmission.In general, you can start with the length of the shift linkage. While the transmission is in Neutral, you can adjust the length of the tube with the adjustment nuts that are found in the middle of the tube. You can also adjust the clocking of the shift tube. You will want to have a helper and some patience. While you have the shifter firmly in first gear, you will use wrenches to tighten the nuts securely. After you have continued through the gears, it?s time to check them. Try to find the gears without forcing the shifter into place. If they are all found, you are ready to roll. Otherwise, you want to perform some more adjustments. If the adjustments don?t make a difference, you need to have the defective transmission parts repaired or replaced. "
Manual Transmission Jumping Out of Gear Repair Cost ?	"The worst situation would mean that you need a new manual transmission. The cost to replace a manual transmission could be anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000, depending on the make and model of your vehicle. However, you can save money by having a rebuilt or remanufactured transmission installed.Thankfully, there are plenty of repairs that can be performed that won?t require a replacement. For example, replacing the transmission mount might only cost $250 to $600, with $50 to $150 making up the expense for the parts. Additionally, other parts can be replaced instead of swapping out the transmission, such as the bearings, linkage and springs.Depending on what needs to be replaced, you might be able to perform the repair yourself. However, swapping a transmission requires a lot of expertise and some advanced equipment. It?s best to leave this task to transmission professionals."
What makes a manual transmission jumping out of gear?	"There are three most likely causes why your manual transmission is jumping out of gear. First, the rubber mounts that hold the engine and transmission in place may break or become loose. As a result, the transmission will move back and forth during accelerations, which misaligns it with its gearshift linkage. Next, the linkage, which usually has cables or rods, may get loose or stretched out, which offsets gear engagement. Lastly, the shift rail within the gearbox has a spring, which holds the gears firmly together when engaged. If broken or weak, the transmission will jump out of gear."
Why won?t my manual transmission stay in gear?	"There are several things to check if your manual transmission won?t stay in gear. First, make sure the engine and transmission mounts are in good shape. Next, check the linkage connecting the gear lever and the transmission, as this shouldn?t have any loose play. If both are fine, the problem might be within the gearbox itself. This can be either a weak shift rail spring, which holds the gears firmly together, worn synchronizer rings, or a low transmission fluid level."
How do I know when a clutch is failing?	"When on its last legs, a clutch will display several symptoms, each of which could be a telltale sign of an impending failure. First, if the clutch?s plate is worn out, your transmission will slip while in gear, especially under heavy loads. You may also experience strong and annoying judder when releasing the clutch pedal. This usually happens when the flywheel?s or pressure plate?s surfaces are bruised and scratched. Lastly, there might be a rattling noise from the transmission when you press the clutch, which is caused by a failing release bearing."
What are the common causes of manual transmission failure?	"Manual transmission is a complex mechanical assembly with several potential failure points. Still, some are far more common than others, such as transmission fluid, which may be low or degraded. If so, it will not lubricate the moving mechanical parts sufficiently, increasing wear. Most modern manual gearboxes have synchronizer rings, whose job is to ensure smooth gear engagement. These components, however, could wear out with time, causing metallic grinding noises when shifting into gear. This may consequently result in damage to other components, such as hub sleeves or gears."
Conclusion	"Manual transmissions are robust components that often last as long as the car. Still, owners may face several issues when driving a vehicle with a manual transmission, and jumping out of gear is one of them. Besides being extremely annoying, this can also be dangerous if it happens when overtaking or in a similar situation.Jumping out of gear is usually caused by broken transmission mounts, misaligned gearshift linkage, or weak shift rail springs. On the upside, most of these components are relatively cheap and easy to repair."
What Is The Toyota Corolla and Prius B Gear?	"The B Gear on a Toyota Corolla or Prius stands for Brake, and it is meant to create more drag on the car when going downhill. It generates maximum braking force in your hybrid Toyota. The additional friction created between the road and wheels is used to slow you down and recharge the battery at the same time.The B gear isn?t beneficial when driving on the highway in normal traffic conditions. During this time, it will only use too much fuel because of the added drag created. "
When To Use The Toyota Corolla & Prius B Gear?	"With a regular automatic transmission, the gears below the D are lower gears. They are very similar to the B gear because more engine drag is created, allowing the vehicle to slow down. For this reason, the best time to use the Toyota B gear is when you are heading down a steep incline.To use the B gear on a Toyota Prius or Corolla, follow these tips.Slow down: To ensure maximum safety, you need to slow the vehicle down. Switch to the B gear: Press the B button on the gear shifter knob. Prepare: The engine will initially rev at first. This could be distracting if you aren?t used to it. The vehicle is also going to slow down.Once you are done using the B gear, switch it back to D. You don?t want to continue using this gear in normal driving conditions. If in doubt, use the B gear the same way you would use lower gears in your car. Lower gears aren?t just for heading downhill but also for pulling heavy loads. However, it?s unlikely you?ll be carrying too much equipment in your Prius or Corolla, as this isn?t a very large car. "
Pros of Toyota B Gear ?	"Just because the Toyota Prius or Corolla comes with a B gear doesn?t mean you always want to use it. Let?s review a few of the top advantages of the B gear so you know when it?s helpful. 1. Good for Driving DownhillToyota Corolla NatureAs you start heading downhill, the car could start to move faster than what you want. Instead of riding the brakes, you can use the B gear to slow down.This gear allows you to maintain safe speeds when going down a steep descent. The increased drag reduces how much you need to brake while on the hill. 2. Recharges BatteriesYour hybrid Corolla or Prius needs to get power to keep the batteries in optimal condition. One way to recharge the batteries is to use the B gear.When in B gear, the hybrid batteries start recharging. With the increased engine drag, regeneration occurs. How do hybrid batteries recharge without the B gear? The battery packs reclaim energy through regenerative braking. As you brake or coast, the electric motor that normally drives the wheels now works as a generator to charge the batteries. The kinetic energy from the friction is turned into power that creates energy. With a normal car, this kinetic energy would have been lost as heat.Additionally, the gas engine charges the batteries while you drive. It?s similar to the setup of the alternator and the starting battery. 3. Reduces Need for BrakesThe B gear ensures you don?t need to ride the brakes. With the help of engine braking, your conventional brakes remain in better condition.If you were to rely solely on the brakes, you would need maintenance more frequently. Just imagine all of the potential money you can save on brake pads and rotors simply by using them less. The brakes could also overheat, which is all avoided with this system."
Cons of the Toyota B Gear ?	"The B gear can provide a lot of support to the hybrid driver, but it?s not meant for constant use. In some ways, it has some serious disadvantages, although many of them aren?t a big deal. Here are just a couple of reasons you won?t want to use it.1. Hurts Fuel EconomyWhen the car is in B gear, engine drag is increased. During this time, you can expect the car to use more fuel than during regular travel. Depending on how it is used and for how long, you may not notice the difference. On the other hand, it could drop fuel economy rapidly, costing you a lot more at the pump.2. Adds Battery Strain Toyota Prius Battery ReplacementWhen going downhill with the B gear, you are going to charge the battery. This is a great way to get more efficiency out of the vehicle.However, if you use it during normal driving conditions, the battery won?t be charged. In fact, it may prevent the battery from holding a charge. 3. Reduces SpeedIf you are driving at higher speeds, the B gear is going to cause problems. The sudden change in speed can lead to skidding.To prevent this from happening, you want to lower the speed of the vehicle before switching to B gear. Otherwise, the ride could get very jerky during the transition. "
What Is The S Gear in my Toyota Corolla? 	"Your Toyota may include both a B and S gear, depending on the Toyota model. You can find out what gears your model has in the Toyota owner?s manual. While B stands for Brake, the S gear means Sport.It works opposite of the B gear. Instead of slowing speeds down, it?s going to speed up the performance. When using this gear, the vehicle operates more like a sports car, especially when going through twists and turns. The similarity between the two is that they both can use more fuel. The B gear uses more fuel because of the drag, while the S gear burns through gas because it increases the power. For this reason alone, neither of them is recommended for everyday driving situations. "
What is the B on my gear shift on a Toyota Camry? 	"If you drive a hybrid Toyota Camry, you may see the B gear. This gear stands for Brake and it?s used to slow down the engine speeds, especially while heading downhill. It creates more drag, so you don?t need to use the brakes as much and the battery gets a recharge. "
How do I drive in B mode?	"As you start going down a hill, you want to slow your speed down as much as possible. Switch into the B gear and prepare for speeds to be harnessed further. Once you have gotten to the bottom of the incline, put the car back into Drive to enjoy the road normally. "
What is gear B used for?	"The B gear is used on Toyota hybrid models and it stands for Brake. Activate this gear when heading downhill to alleviate the need for brakes. Because of the added engine drag, you?ll also achieve some added battery recharging for increased efficiency. "
What does B stand for in a Toyota Corolla?	"The B gear means Brake. With your hybrid Toyota Corolla, this gear is used to reduce the need for braking while heading downhill. With added engine drag, speeds are reduces and the battery will be recharged. It?s not meant to be used for normal highway driving. "
Conclusion	"There are a lot of neat features available with your hybrid Toyota Prius or Corolla, including the B gear. If you haven?t used the B gear previously, it?s time to learn how. Now that you?ve read our handy guide, you should have a better understanding of this special gear.Start practicing with it as you head downhill. You will get the hang of it after some practice and it may become one of your favorite features over time. Just remember to switch out once you hit the open road again or the drive will be severely hindered. "
Where Is The Transmission Speed Sensor Located?	"The transmission speed sensor is usually found near the transmission?s output shaft but can be in various locations based on what model you drive. In some car models, it can be found inside the transmission fluid pan, but it?s usually found externally.The transmission speed sensor measures road speed based on how the output shaft turns. It works in conjunction with wheel speed sensors for precise operation.Here are a few of the most popular models and the location of the transmission speed sensor. If you are looking for the location on a model not shown here, you can check your service manual or do a quick online search. BMW In many BMW vehicles, there are sensors for both the input and output shafts. Both of the sensors can usually be found in the transmission pan. However, in many BMW models, the output sensor can also be located on the outside of the transmission near the back.The input sensor is located near the front of the pan, while the output sensor can be found closer to the back. Check the service manual for a diagram.Ford F-150 The Ford F-150 truck has a vehicle speed sensor usually found on the back of the transmission. It?s usually near the tail shaft, on the driver?s side, above the transmission fluid pan. If you have a two-wheel drive truck, it?s much easier to see. On the four-wheel drive models, the transfer case can be in the way, so you have to remove the front drive shaft to get to it. Honda Honda vehicles can also have a slightly difficult configuration. With some Hondas, you have to remove the air filter box to get to the speed sensor, due to the transverse engine.With the box off, you can see the sensor located on top of the transmission. In the service manual, you can get more detailed steps. MINI Cooper With MINI models, the speed sensor is normally found on the right of the transmission. Usually, it?s side-mounted and resembles a plug.The overall length of this sensor is around three inches. It?s connected with a plug-and-play fitting, so it?s not hard to remove. Toyota Most Toyota cars have a sensor found at the bottom of the transmission. If it?s not there, you will find it on the side. Depending on the vehicle you drive, the speed sensor can be easy to get to. Other times, you may need help from a professional mechanic. Allison Some of the transfer cases with Allison transmissions contain one sensor. There are also some models that have two, so you need to figure out which one you have.In the rear of the transfer case, you can find both of the sensors. The tail shaft is where they get mounted with a device that has one sensor on either side. "
How Do I Replace The Transmission Speed Sensor?	"When the speed sensor fails, you want to replace it immediately. With some basic tools and a little know-how, you can perform the work yourself. We recommend reading through the service manual for your vehicle before getting started. Once you are ready, here are a few general steps you can follow.Park the vehicle on a flat spot. Only work on the vehicle once the engine is completely cool.Lift the front end with a floor jack. Secure the vehicle on jack stands at the appropriate spots.Locate the transmission speed sensor for your vehicle type.Remove the electrical connector attached to the speed sensor. You may need to push in the tabs on either side. Remove the sensor from the housing. This action may require a wrench or socket.Replace the sensor with a new one. Twist it in place clockwise until it is secure.Connect the new sensor to the electrical connector. Lower the vehicle back down to the ground. Take the vehicle for a test drive to see if the problem is resolved.If, at any time, you don?t feel comfortable working on the speed sensor, reach out to a professional mechanic in your area. You don?t want to take unnecessary chances and break something else. "
Transmission Speed Sensor Replacement Cost ?	"To replace the transmission speed sensor, you may spend $75 to $450. The cost depends on what type of vehicle you drive and where you live, as labor rates can vary by region. It?s often best to replace the transmission speed sensor yourself if you feel equipped to do so. Because the sensor may only cost $20 to $100, you could save a lot of cash. With that in mind, not all sensors are simple to replace, so read the service manual before diving in. You may need to remove a lot of components just to get your hands on the sensor. "
Is it easy to replace a transmission speed sensor?	"With most vehicles, it?s just a matter of locating the sensor and disconnecting it before putting the new one in its place. However, a few vehicles have a different configuration that makes it difficult to get to the sensor without removing other parts. Read your car?s service manual to see what your model requires. "
What is the difference between a vehicle speed sensor and a transmission speed sensor?	The VSS is another name for the transmission speed sensor. Both of these terms describe the small sensors mounted on the transmission that determines how fast your car is going based on the rotation of the transmission shaft?s toothed wheel. This sensor is different from the speed sensors on the wheels of your car. 
How much does it cost to fix a transmission speed sensor?	"On average, you may spend between $75 and $450 to have the transmission speed sensor replaced at a local shop. If you can replace the sensor at home, you will only have to pay for the parts, which could be between $20 and $100 instead. "
What happens when the transmission speed sensor goes out?	"As the sensor fails, shifting becomes rougher and unpredictable. The cruise control can also fail because the shaft speed can?t be measured. You may also see the Check Engine Light, which attempts to tell you of the fault, so you can repair it. "
Conclusion	"Most at-home mechanics aren?t dealing with transmission speed sensor replacements every day. It?s not a part that goes bad regularly. For that reason, you may not be familiar with the location, replacement procedures and symptoms of a faulty part. Thankfully, our comprehensive guide helped you to figure all of these aspects out.With a little patience, you can replace the transmission speed sensor on your vehicle and save money over visiting a local repair shop. You don?t need a lot of experience, just a willingness to learn something new."
what are the Causes of Transmission that Won?t Shift into 3rd Gear ?	"Issues with shifting the automatic transmission to 3rd gear often relate to degraded transmission fluid. However, the transmission could also be struggling because of a bad torque converter, a faulty PCM or a damaged shift solenoid that needs to be repaired. Here is a more detailed list of why your transmission won?t shift into 3rd gear:1. Contaminated Transmission FluidDrain Transmission FluidTransmission fluid is needed to lubricate the gears and moving parts located inside. It operates much like motor oil, except it?s designed specifically for the transmission. When the transmission fluid gets old, dirt and debris begin to build up in it.Degraded transmission fluid makes it much more difficult for shifting to occur normally. It can also damage the transmission permanently if it isn?t flushed and replaced promptly. Check your vehicle owner?s manual to find out how often the transmission fluid should be replaced. Following these guidelines can ensure the transmission remains in optimal health. 2. Malfunctioning Shift SolenoidSymptoms Of A Bad Shift SolenoidInside the transmission, there are several shift solenoids that are responsible for changing the gears automatically for you when the TCM decides to do so. If one of these fails, it can cause shifting issues with any gear, including 3rd gear, so it is therefore very possible that a bad shift solenoid is to blame.The shift solenoids are most often reached by removing the valve body, which is done by removing the transmission oil pan of your car, but in some cases, you have to remove the transmission completely and take that transmission apart.2. Bad Torque ConverterTorque ConverterThe torque converter is responsible for engaging and disengaging the transmission from the engine. It includes vital components, such as a stator and a turbine. Any of the parts in the torque converter can fail, leading to a slipping transmission. It can also lead to trouble shifting into a particular gear. 4. Faulty PCM or TCMTransmission Control ModuleWhen the PCM or TCM fails, the transmission performance is degraded. The PCM or TCM is responsible for controlling the gearbox. In this way, it acts as the system?s brain.As the PCM starts to fail, you may notice other symptoms as well. It?s common to see the Check Engine Light and experience erratic shifting patterns. The vehicle might even go into the Limp Mode until the problem is resolved."
What to Do When Auto Transmission Won?t Shift ?	"1. Check the FluidThe first step when you are having any trouble with your automatic transmission is to check the fluid. Unless your vehicle has a sealed transmission, you will be able to pull out the dipstick and read the levels. Make sure you wipe it off and put it back in for a more accurate reading. If the levels are low or below the fill line, it?s time to add some fluid.While you are checking how much fluid there is, be sure to also check the condition. The color of the fluid offers a lot of information about the health of the transmission. If the fluid is good, it will be a red-pink color. As it gets older, it starts to turn brown, indicating it?s time for a transmission fluid flush. However, if the fluid is black or dark brown and has a burnt smell or metal shavings included, you could be looking at larger problems. 2. Read Trouble CodesWhen there is a fault in the car?s computers, an error code is set. You can read these codes and learn more about the problem with an OBDII scanner.Each vehicle uses different codes, although there are some that are universal. For example, you might see a P0606 or P0113 code if there is an issue with the PCM. Whatever code you see, it?s possible to do some research online and hunt down the trouble for a quick fix. 3. Contact A ProfessionalEven if you are a skilled mechanic, you might encounter a problem that is over your head. If you see a code that you don?t know how to resolve or you are unsure why the transmission is acting up, it?s best to get professional guidance.In many cases, prompt attention can alleviate larger transmission problems down the road. The longer you let the issue continue, the more damage might occur to the transmission. Hopefully, the problem is related to a simple issue that can be resolved quickly."
What would cause the transmission not to shift?	"Due to its complexity, several potential causes might stop the automatic transmission from shifting. The first thing to check is the transmission fluid, which may be low or contaminated. Other likely failure points include bad shift solenoids, a slipping torque converter, and a faulty transmission control module. In addition, there are a variety of engine and vehicle sensors that provide data necessary for the transmission?s operation. Using an OBD2 scan tool to check the stored error codes could reveal a lot here."
What causes a transmission to slip in 3rd gear?	"An automatic transmission may slip in 3rd gear for a variety of reasons. Most potential causes coincide with those that would result in other gearshift issues, such as low transmission fluid levels or faulty shift solenoids. But apart from that, there?s also a failure point specific to 3rd gear issues, and that?s the torque converter clutch. This mechanical coupling, which connects the engine to the transmission, may become worn or damaged over time, causing 3rd gear to slip or not engage."
How do I fix a transmission not shifting?	"If an automatic transmission is having shifting issues or slipping, checking its fluid level is the first thing to do. Apart from insufficient lubrication, this fluid, if low, will overheat and lose its ability to move mechanical components. If this doesn?t help, checking the codes might help narrow down the problem. Clogged or worn shift solenoids are a common issue, especially in transmissions whose fluid changes have been neglected. Apart from that, it?s possible to have a slipping torque converter or a faulty transmission control module."
Can low transmission fluid cause no shifting?	"Yes, the automatic transmission will likely have shifting issues or even start slipping if the fluid level is low. If there isn?t enough of it, the transmission fluid will overheat, which affects its hydraulic properties. Consequently, the transmission?s operation will be affected, as it uses pressurized transmission fluid to move its mechanical components. This is why the correct fluid level is vital for automatic transmission."
Conclusion	"Modern automatic transmissions, with their sensitive and precisely-made components, are elaborate and complex devices. As a result, even the slightest irregularity may affect their operation, causing gear shift issues or slipping. This, in most cases, happens because of low transmission fluid levels or bad shift solenoids.Apart from that, a malfunctioning torque converter or faulty transmission control module may cause various gearshift issues. If your transmission is slipping or not shifting correctly, you should check it immediately. Driving with a malfunctioning automatic transmission can quickly result in costly damage."
What Is A Shift Lock For?	"Passenger vehicles with an automatic transmission are equipped with a shift lock and a release as a safety measure. Many modern cars have a button that needs to be depressed to shift out of Park. This simple feature prevents the car from shifting into gear without the key in the ignition and your foot on the brake pedal.This shift lock lever is located on the side or the top of your gear shifter. When the transmission is in Park, the button is automatically enabled. This simple feature prevents car theft and accidental roll-away, but it can also be a pain if something malfunctions. Until you release the shift lock, you can?t transfer the knob into gear unless you use the manual shift lock release, designed for emergencies."
What Does The Shift Lock Release Do?	"The shift lock release provides a manual way to get the car into gear. It allows you to switch from the Park position with the engine off and your foot off of the brake pedal. The button can be found near the gear shifter and gets pushed in when you want to move the shifter. Shift Lock Release ButtonWhen the car is in Park, the shift lock is automatically enabled. This safety feature ensures that the car isn?t going anywhere until you put the key in and start it up. Without pushing in the button on the gear shifter, you wouldn?t be able to move your car in most circumstances.However, there are times when you need to take the car out of gear without going through the normal motions. While the system is set up to keep it from accidentally going into gear, you could face a situation where it?s necessary to override the safety feature. That?s where the release comes into play. "
When Do I Need To Use The Shift Lock Release?	"When everything is operating as it should, you won?t need to manually override the shift lock. Instead, you will put your key in the ignition, turn the car on and push the brake pedal. Once those steps are accomplished, you can push in the button on the gear selector and get going. However, there are times when the system doesn?t work as it should. If the car ignition malfunctions or your car battery dies, you may find yourself without a way to get the car out of gear.Additionally, if you need to have the vehicle towed, it?s important to put the vehicle in Neutral without running the engine. All of these are cases when you might require the override button for the shift lock release. Without it, the car would remain stuck in the Park position, rendering it unable to move. "
How to Use The Shift Lock Release ?	"When the car is operating as intended, you won?t need to think hard about how to get the vehicle out of Park. You simply turn the key in the ignition, push down the brake pedal and depress the button on the shifter to move it to the appropriate gear.With that said, there are times when you need to manually override the shifter, or you have trouble. In these situations, you need to use the shift lock release function to get moving. Here are a few steps to consider with most automatic transmission vehicles.1. Consult Owner?s ManualCar Owners ManualYour first step whenever you are attempting to do something new is to read the owner?s manual. While the operation will be the same for most vehicle brands and types, you should always read the manufacturer?s recommendations first.If you don?t understand what you are reading in the manual, you may want to ask for more help. For example, if a tow company is providing roadside assistance, they should be able to direct you on how to use the shift lock release or they will do it for you.2. Verify Car Can?t Be ShiftedYour next step is to verify that you can?t shift the car the usual way. There?s no reason to proceed with additional steps if you can move the gear selector normally.Put your key in the ignition and start the car. With your foot firmly on the brake pedal, try to push the button on the gear selector and change gears. Of course, if you can?t get the car started, you have bigger problems to deal with first. However, if the car battery is dead, you may be able to jump-start it and get moving again.3. Locate Shift Lock ReleaseYour next step is to find the override slot for the lock. It?s going to be located on the shifter console, normally flush with the panel. It will be labeled so you know what it is. It could also contain a plastic cap on top of it that would need to be removed before going further.4. Push in ReleaseOnce you find the button, you?ll notice how small it is. It won?t be simple to push it in, which is what the automaker wanted. Otherwise, it would be too simple to get the car out of gear, making it a safety hazard.For this reason, you will need a small tool to push in the slot. We recommend using your key, a nail file or a compact screwdriver. Once you get the button pushed in, you need to hold it down while you shift the selector to its desired location. After you shift, you can let off the release and put the cap back in place. "
Do All Cars Have A Shift Lock Release?	"The shift lock release function is not found on manual transmission vehicles. It?s also not on older automatic transmission vehicles. However, since 2010, most automakers have used a shift lock feature and release button to enhance driving safety. "
Where Is The Shift Lock Release Located?	"With the majority of car models, the small button to release the shift lock can be found directly on the panel of the gear selector. It?s generally flush with the panel and has a cover over it. There are some cars that have a more obscure location for the release, forcing you to read the owner?s manual if you can?t find it. "
Why Don?t Manual Cars Have A Shift Lock?	"Manual cars operate differently from the automatic transmission. To shift gears with a manual transmission, you must depress the clutch while moving the shifter. With this design, you can put the car in gear even when it?s not running. In an automatic car, there?s no need to change gears, so the shift lock is incorporated to ensure more safety. "
Conclusion	"Knowing the purpose of the shift lock release and how to use it can dramatically enhance your experience during times of an emergency. If you are used to driving an automatic transmission vehicle, this feature may not be new to you. However, it can provide a big change for anyone looking to switch from a manual to an automatic transmission.The release button is typically located on the side or top of the gear selector panel and it helps you shift from Park into a specific gear without the ignition on.When trouble presents itself, you now have the tools needed to work around it. While you don?t want to think about what could happen if the car needs to be towed or the battery dies, it?s best to be prepared ahead of time. Knowing how to use the shift lock release is important, but it?s even more critical that you figure out why you can?t shift the selector normally and resolve those issues promptly."
what are the Symptoms Of A Bad Shift Solenoid ?	"The most common symptoms of a bad or failing shift solenoid include hard shifting, stuck in gear, rough shifting, or other shifting issues with your automatic transmission. You may also notice a transmission warning light or other warning lights on your dashboard.This is a quick look at the signs that can appear when you have problems with a faulty shift solenoid. Here is more information on the signs of a bad shift solenoid to look for:1. Check Engine lightCheck Engine Light On Dashboard E1609869927250The first sign you will notice of all bad shift solenoid symptoms is probably the check engine light. The check engine light will light up even when there is a problem with the transmission.Usually, if you use an OBD2 canner to read the trouble codes, you may see a P0700 Trouble code. This code basically tells you that there is a problem with the transmission control, and more trouble codes will be found in the transmission control module.2. Transmission Warning LightGearbox SymbolSome cars also have a separate warning light for the transmission. If this light is on, there may be a stored trouble code related to a bad shift solenoid.To read the trouble codes from the transmission control module, you need an OBD2 scanner to read generic and enhanced trouble codes. Most cheaper ones can only read the codes from the engine control module.3. Shifting delaysRpm LimitIf the transmission control unit recognizes any shift solenoid problems, it may cause the transmission to shift very slowly. This applies to both upshifting and downshifting.4. Skipping gearsAutomatic ShiftingYou may also notice that your car has a problem engaging some gears, and therefore it will skip to the next gear. This is a big sign that you have transmission shift solenoid problems. You have one or more shift solenoid for each gear, and if one is broken, it will not shift to that gear. Instead, it will jump directly to the next gear.5. Stuck in gearNo Gear ShiftingIf the shift solenoid got damaged while the gear was engaged, it might cause the transmission to be stuck in that gear. If this is the case, you can try to give the shift solenoid external power to release the gear if you know how to do it.6. Downshift or Upshift IssuesStuck In GearYou may also have intermittent problems with the transmission shift solenoid, which will cause shifting problems. This can cause hard shifting or shiftings at too low or too high RPM, for example.7. Limp modeLimp ModeLimp mode is a protective mode for your engine, and you will notice it mostly because your engine will get an RPM limit of 2500-3000 RPM, and it may also affect your transmission shifting.Limp mode causes the transmission to not shift over gear 3, and if there is a bad shift solenoid, it may cause your car to activate limp mode. You can read more about it here: Limp mode."
What Is A Shift Solenoid?	"A transmission shift solenoid is an electromagnet component of an automatic or semi-automatic transmission that controls the flow of fluid to change gears and other functions in the transmission.The transmission control unit is collecting information from the engine, vehicle speed sensors, and other sensors. The transmission control module uses all these parameters to calculate when it?s time to shift to the next gear.When it?s time to shift, the transmission control unit sends out power or ground to the required shift solenoid, and it causes the solenoid to open and let the transmission oil flow into the valve body, which then shifts to the next gear."
where the Shift Solenoid Location ?	"The transmission shift solenoids are located inside the valve body of your automatic transmission.They are integrated into the valve body, and on some car models, you can see them without removing the valve body, while on others, you have to remove the valve body to reach them.In the picture above, you see the shift solenoids located on the valve body. The shift solenoids are the tubes with yellow, green, and black colors."
what is the cost  Shift Solenoid Replacement Cost ?	"A single shift solenoid?s replacement cost is between $100 and $350, and a shift solenoid pack costs between $400 and $700, including transmission fluid, filter, parts, and labor work.The replacement cost of a shift solenoid depends a lot on what car model and transmission model you have.As I mentioned before, in some cars, you can?t replace just one solenoid. You have to replace the whole solenoid pack, or in some cars, even the whole valve body, which is often very expensive.When you replace a shift solenoid, valve body, or solenoid pack, you should always replace the transmission fluid and filter.These are the prices, including parts and labor costs. The prices do not include diagnosis and fluid replacement costs.Single shift solenoid replacement cost: $50-150$Shift solenoid pack replacement cost: $300-600$Valve body replacement cost: $500 to $1000The price is also affected a lot depending on what parts and transmission fluid you are using. Aftermarket parts are often cheaper than original parts but often not of the same quality.You do also want to look for technical service bulletins for your vehicle because many car models such as Hyundai have bulletins on the shift solenoids."
How to Diagnose a Shift Solenoid Problem?	"First, we have to figure out if it?s a wiring, shift solenoid, TCM, or mechanical problem. To do so, you should read and research the trouble codes carefully to understand the problem before starting the troubleshooting.If the trouble code tells us that it?s stuck or an electrical problem, it is most likely a wiring or shift solenoid problem and you need to test the shift solenoids.Many shift solenoid-related codes can be solved by doing a transmission fluid replacement or carrying out a transmission flush. A transmission fluid change is often not that expensive, so it?s well worth doing.Using a diagnostic scanner is a must when it comes to shift solenoid-related problems.Here is a list of how you can carry out the troubleshooting with a scanner:Find a transmission wiring diagram for your transmission.Find out which pins are going to the affected shift solenoid.Loosen the transmission wiring plug on the transmissionUse the OBD2 scanner and start the output test of the affected shift solenoid.Measure with a multimeter to see whether you get both 12 volts and ground to the shift solenoid at the plug on the transmission on the affected pin.If you do not get both 12 volts and ground, you may have a wiring problem or a faulty transmission control unit (TCM).If you get 12 volts and ground and the shift solenoid trouble code keeps coming back after you have erased it, you probably have a faulty shift solenoid."

Can I drive with a faulty shift solenoid?	"Although you can probably drive your car with a faulty shift solenoid, it is not recommended. A faulty shift solenoid can cause further damage to your transmission which will be more expensive than repairing the shift solenoid immediately."
Can I replace a shift solenoid yourself?	"Whether you can replace a shift solenoid yourself is entirely up to what car model you drive and how much knowledge you have. Some shift solenoids are fairly easy to replace by removing the transmission and valve body with the help of a repair manual. However, it is quite difficult to replace a shift solenoid in most car models, and you may need a computer afterward to adjust it."
How do I fix a stuck shift solenoid?	"In some cases, you can fix a stuck shift solenoid by changing the transmission oil and filter and doing a transmission fluid flush. Unfortunately, in most cases you will need to replace the stuck shift solenoid if a flush doesn?t help."
How many shift solenoids are in a transmission?	"There are usually 2 to 5 shift solenoids in most automatic transmissions, depending on the make and model of the car. Their primary purpose is to control the flow of hydraulic fluid to the clutch packs in the transmission, which allow for shifts between gears."
Conclusion	"If you notice any of the bad shift solenoid symptoms mentioned above, it?s time to take your car to a mechanic if you are not sure how to diagnose it yourself. They will be able to diagnose the problem and, hopefully, fix it without having to replace the entire transmission.Worn shift solenoids are a much more common problem in older cars, so if you have an older vehicle, this is something to keep in mind."
What Does ?S? Mean on a Gear Shift?	"The S on a gear shift stands for Sport Mode. You can only find the ?S? if the car features a Sport Mode. When shifted into the Sport Mode, the engine delivers higher RPMs with the transmission in a lower gear, so the drive is sportier and more responsive.It?s meant to provide a sports car-like drive with any vehicle. Whether you are driving a family-friendly SUV or executive sedan, you can increase on-road enjoyment if Sport Mode is activated. However, exactly what the sport mode will do to your vehicle depends on the model. In most car models, the sports mode will only change the automatic transmission settings, while some will change both engine performance and suspension."
Benefits of Driving in Sport Mode ?	"1. More Horsepower/TorqueIt doesn?t matter how much power your car produces, there will be times when you still want more. By shifting the gear selector into the ?S? mode, you can get more with ease in many car models. Right away, there should be a dramatic increase in power and torque. It may even help you achieve a better top speed. 2. Improved Throttle ResponseWhen you push the accelerator pedal in ?S? mode, you are going to feel the difference. The near-instant power and torque are going to translate into a more responsive throttle. With this increased throttle, you gain faster acceleration. There?s less waiting around for the power to be delivered, so the 0-60 mph time might be shortened. 3. Tighter SteeringWhen the car is in Sport Mode, the steering automatically tightens up on some car models. As you turn the steering wheel, the car is going to respond faster to what you want it to do. If you are on a curvy road or heading over the mountain, you?ll appreciate the fast response. It also helps you feel like a race car driver, even if you are sitting behind the wheel of your family?s people mover. 4. Stiffer SuspensionIf you want a controlled ride, everything relies on the suspension. Sport Mode ensures that the suspension offers a firmer feel and it will often lower when equipped with an adjustable setup. With a stiffer suspension, you will notice less body roll. There?s also a lower center of gravity, so you can handle the curves with ease. However, the stiffer suspension can affect comfort to some level."
Disadvantages of Driving in Sport Mode ?	"1. Reduced Fuel EconomyWhen you increase the power, torque and responsiveness of the car engine, you can naturally expect the amount of fuel needed to increase too. More fuel is going to burn so this power can be produced. In many cases, the change will be dramatic and noticeable, so you can expect to visit the gas station more often. However, some people find the power output increase to be worth every penny that needs to be spent. 2. More Engine WearThere was a time when the average engine was only expected to last eight years or 150,000 miles. However, modern technology has made it easier to keep a car engine running 200,000-250,000 miles on average. If you are providing regular maintenance, you could achieve even more life.However, using the Sport Mode is going to put more pressure on the car engine. If you are overworking the motor for extended periods, you can expect the lifespan to naturally decrease. You may also require more frequent maintenance because of the wear that?s occurring. Consider providing more frequent oil and filter changes if you are pushing the engine to the limit regularly. "
When to Use Sport Mode?	"Sport mode is reserved for those moments when you need more power, or you are looking to gain added handling through tight corners. For this reason, it?s often recommended to unleash Sport Mode when heading up inclines.During these times, you can expect the transmission to remain in a lower gear, so the RPMs can climb for better acceleration. Additionally, if you are heading down a curvy, windy road, you might prefer the Sport Mode option. It can give you more steering responsiveness to handle what?s ahead. It can also adjust some suspensions to provide a more controlled ride, ensuring less body roll. If you are driving your family to school and aren?t in any hurry to get there, it might not be the best time to activate the Sport Mode."
?D? vs. ?S? on Automotive Transmission ?	"If you look at the gearshift, you should definitely see the ?D? setting, which stands for the standard Drive Mode. When your vehicle is equipped with the Sport Mode, there should also be an ?S? on the gear selector. How are these two related and what makes them different?The Drive Mode is where most cars remain when heading down the road. In the Drive Mode, the transmission shifts at regular intervals, based on what the manufacturer decided was best to balance power and efficiency. In comparison, the Sport Mode setting is going to unleash the maximum amount of power at the expense of efficiency. The Sport Mode helps to keep the engine in a lower gear, so the RPMs stay higher. It?s going to provide faster acceleration and more power overall. However, it?s also going to use up more fuel than running in the standard Drive Mode.However, either mode is easy to shift to. On the gear selector, you can find either option, allowing you to change it at any time. There are also some vehicle models that feature a Sport Mode button instead of a selection on the gear shifter itself. "
Can I Drive in Sport Mode All the Time?	"There?s nothing stopping you from keeping your vehicle in Sport Mode all the time. The manufacturer created the car so that it could run in Sport Mode at all times without any restriction.Does this mean that you should keep it activated? It?s not usually the best decision. For starters, you are going to need to put out more money for fuel. Unless you have an unlimited supply of money, this is going to add up and start to drain your bank account. Additionally, you are going to put more strain on the engine than what?s needed. If you want the car to last, it?s wise to only use Sport Mode when the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Beyond that, you might enjoy the ride that Sport Mode provides, but do your passengers? With the stiffer suspension, ride comfort can be reduced. If you are going to drive around town in Sport Mode, it?s best to check with the passengers to see how they feel. "
Can I shift from D to S while driving?	"Yes, you can shift from D to S while driving. However, it?s important to do it carefully and you don?t want to have the gas pedal to the floor while you?re doing it. Let off the gas and engage the sport mode gear and wait for it to shift."
Does sport mode use more gas?	"Yes, most cars will use more gas when driving in sport mode than in normal driving mode. However, how much more gas a car uses in sport mode depends on a variety of factors. Some cars will just change the automatic transmission settings and shift gear later, while some will also increase horsepower."
Does driving in low gear hurt my car?	"Yes, driving in a low gear will damage your car in the long run. When you drive in a low gear, the engine will rotate faster and cause more stress on the engine parts. It will definitely shorten the life of your engine if you do it frequently."
Is sport mode good for highway driving?	"Sport mode is not optimal for normal highway driving. Sport mode causes the transmission to shift later and run in a lower gear, which will increase fuel consumption and wear on the engine. But if you need the horsepower on the highway, it might be a good idea."
Conclusion	"While Sport mode isn?t necessary for most daily drivers, it can definitely be a nice feature to have if you often drive on steep roads or just like to go fast every now and then. Sport mode functionality varies greatly by car model, and with some car models, you get a completely different car when you switch to sport mode.I hope you enjoyed this guide and now you know everything you need to know about sport modes in automatic transmissions."
How to Check Automatic Transmission Fluid ?	"To check the transmission fluid, you should first park the car at level ground with the engine running. Locate the dipstick and pull it out. At first glance, you should be able to examine its overall condition. Wipe the stick clean with a rag and put it back in. Now, pull it back out to determine how much fluid is in the system based on the lines of the dipstick.Here is a more detailed list of how to check the automatic transmission fluid:1. Park the car on level groundBefore you get started, park the car on level ground. You want the gearshift in Park and the engine running. However, you don?t want the engine to be hot. It?s best if it?s only slightly warmed up.Make sure the parking brake and parking are engaged to prevent accidents.2. Locate the DipstickTransmission Fluid DipstickFind the appropriate dipstick. There will be a couple under the hood in most cars, with one for the oil level and another for transmission fluid. Check the owner?s manual if you are having trouble locating it. If you don?t find the dipstick, it?s possible that your vehicle doesn?t have one. We cover that situation more in a little bit. 3. Check ConditionPull out the dipstick and take an initial evaluation of the fluid. You aren?t going to be too worried about the level yet.However, while it is out, you can clean the fluid off of the dipstick with a shop rag or lint-free towel. Evaluate the color and smell to ensure it?s in good condition. 4. Recheck the Dipstick LevelWith the dipstick wiped clean, put it back in the tube. Pull the dipstick back out and check how full the system is. You want the transmission fluid line to hit the Full mark on the dipstick. If it needs more, add the appropriate automatic transmission fluid, but don?t overfill it. "
How to Evaluate Transmission Fluid ?	"1. ColorWhen transmission fluid is new, it?s normally bright and red. It should also be transparent. If the transmission fluid starts to look brownish or a darker red, it might not be new anymore. These darker colors reveal contamination of the fluid. It would be wise to change the fluid at this point. If you see black transmission fluid, you are in a worse situation. The fluid has become burnt, likely due to some kind of transmission issues. You should see a transmission specialist to figure out what?s going on. 2. SmellTransmission fluid can have a quite strong smell, but it shouldn?t smell burnt.If the fluid smells like burnt toast, you should be alarmed. This burnt smell means that the transmission is suffering from issues. It?s probably also black-colored, as discussed above. 3. ConsistencyIt?s natural for automatic transmission fluid to appear a little thicker than when it was new. This shouldn?t cause you to worry at all. The closer to new fluid it looks like, the better the condition is.You should still be able to see through the fluid, showing that there are no particles inside. If you see particles or contaminants, you need to look closer. Any metal shavings in the fluid could indicate possible transmission failure. Additionally, if the liquid has become foamy, you might have used the wrong type or the transmission has been overheating. Either way, you want to take quick steps to correct the problem before it becomes worse. "
How Often Should You Check Transmission Fluid?	"When it comes to checking car fluid levels, it?s best to have a monthly appointment to give everything a quick glance. You can pull the transmission dipstick, check the oil, fill up the windshield washer fluid and evaluate tire pressures. With all of these tasks together, you ensure that problems are caught early, so permanent damage is less likely.However, there are times when more frequent checks are recommended. If you are hard on your vehicle, such as regularly towing or hauling heavy equipment, you might want to check the fluid level weekly. You should also check it more often if you drive in severe climates, such as dusty and sandy environments. Aside from checking the transmission fluid, regular maintenance is also important. Every manufacturer sets a maintenance schedule that you should follow. The guidelines will be outlined in your owner?s manual. However, the recommendation is usually to have the transmission fluid changed every 30,000 to 60,000 miles. You might also consider a transmission fluid flush every 90,000 miles.Many newer vehicles have intervals set at 100,000 miles or more before the first automatic transmission fluid change. However, this interval seems to alarm most professional mechanics, so you must use your own discernment about what?s best for your model. "
What if There?s No Transmission Fluid Dipstick?	"Modern vehicles are now being built with sealed transmissions. These high-end transmissions don?t come with a dipstick because some of them are hailed as being maintenance-free. According to the manufacturers, you will never need to perform maintenance on the transmission, so there?s no reason for the dipstick.However, there are also vehicles with sealed transmissions but with an electronic level sensor instead of a dipstick.If you suspect your automatic transmission has an electronic transmission level sensor, check your owner?s manual for the correct procedure for finding the transmission fluid level."
Cost to Change Automatic Transmission Fluid ?	"If you can change the transmission fluid yourself, you may only spend an average of $50. The most important consideration is to purchase the right transmission fluid for your vehicle, as there are different kinds. If you don?t feel skilled enough to change the transmission fluid yourself, you must take your vehicle to a professional shop. At this shop, you might spend $50 to $250 on the fluid change. The price depends on what type of vehicle you drive, how much fluid is needed and where the shop is located. If you go to an independent lube shop, you will spend the least, but the mechanics aren?t usually factory-trained. On the other hand, you will spend more to visit a dealership or specialized transmission shop, but the experts have more knowledge of the vehicle, thereby offering some additional peace of mind."
Do I check automatic transmission fluid with the car running?	"Yes, in most car models you should check the automatic transmission fluid level with the car engine running. If you check it with the engine off, it will show you a much higher level. Check your owner?s manual for the correct procedure in your car model."
Do I check automatic transmission fluid hot or cold?	"It is best to check the automatic transmission fluid level when the fluid is warm in most car models. However, it depends on the car model, so it is better to check your owner?s manual. In many vehicles, you should check the transmission oil at a specific fluid temperature, but it can be difficult to determine without the right diagnostic tools."
How long do I let the car run before checking the transmission fluid?	"You should let your car engine run for 5 to 10 minutes before checking the transmission fluid. This will ensure that the fluid is not too hot or too cold. However, check your owner?s manual for the correct procedure for your car model."
Do I leave the car running when adding transmission fluid?	"Yes, it?s a good idea to top up the transmission fluid with the engine running, as this will pump the new transmission fluid around. However you can also fill it with the engine off, but you still need to let the fluid run in the system for a while before checking the fluid level again."
what are the Causes of Transmission Fluid Leak When Parked ?	"A transmission fluid leak when parked can come from a damaged pan or faulty drain plug. It?s also possible that a gasket or seal is damaged. Transmission leaks can also come from a broken line or the torque converter. Proper diagnosis is needed to make the correct repair. Here is a more detailed list of the most common causes why your transmission is leaking fluid when parked:1. Damaged PanIt?s very possible that the problem comes back to a damaged transmission pan. Over time, holes or loose bolts can occur, leaving a place where fluid can flow through.The best way to prevent this problem is to regularly inspect the pan and its gasket position. A good time to do this is when you perform a fluid change. Look for any rust and ensure the rust didn?t go through the pan and created a hole.2. Faulty Drain PlugIf you don?t tighten the drain plug completely after a transmission fluid change, it could leak. The same can occur if you over-tighten it, which is why you must secure it only to factory specifications. You also want to ensure that the drain plug o-ring is not bad.This is also the reason why you should be careful where you have the transmission fluid changed. It might seem wise to save money by going to entry-level mechanics, but they are more likely to strip the drain plug than an experienced mechanic. 3. Damaged GasketOn most car models, there is a gasket between the transmission and the transmission pan that will leak when the car is parked because when the engine is not running, the transmission fluid level will increase.The gaskets working in the system can fail after long exposure to heat. It?s also possible that the gasket hasn?t been aligned correctly when it was installed. Either way, it?s common to see a leak coming from the gasket area.By fixing this issue immediately, you can prevent further problems from occurring. Otherwise, the consistent leak and lack of fluid can lead to expensive transmission repairs. 4. Worn-Out SealsThe automatic transmission contains various seals meant to keep the fluid where it belongs. However, the seals can crack and degrade, especially after many years of exposure to heat. You can find seals at the input and output shafts. There are also seals regularly located around the speedometer input, tail housing and shifter housing. 5. Broken LineThe transmission system is made up of many lines transporting fluid where it belongs. Most of the lines are designed to hold up after many years of use, whether they are constructed from steel or aluminum. However, a line can crack or break at any time. If the line were to break, a fluid leak would become evident, plus the system would be low on fluid, thereby leading to bigger problems. 6. Faulty Torque ConverterThe torque converter is responsible for pushing fluid through the system. It?s the component necessary for transferring power from the engine to the wheels.If the torque converter sustains a crack or damage, leakage can occur. The leak can also come from defective needle bearings, which also require the need for a new torque converter."
what are the Symptoms of Transmission Fluid Leak ?	"1. Leak Under CarThe most obvious symptom of a leak is a puddle of fluid below the car. If the car is leaking transmission fluid, the puddle will usually be dark red. However, there are other fluid types, so don?t rule it out if it?s not red.In the same regard, you can?t assume all red fluid is from the transmission. Power steering fluid is another type that is usually red. 2. Lagging AccelerationTransmission fluid is required to help the engine work with the wheels cohesively. If the fluid starts running low, you might notice some lag during acceleration.This delay comes when the fluid can?t reach its proper location fast enough. As the fluid level gets lower, you will have more trouble accelerating. 3. Grinding GearsThere are many reasons why the gears could grind in your transmission. However, you don?t want to overlook the possibility that you just need to add some fluid. If there?s not enough lubrication of the gears, they will grind as they touch one another. Don?t allow the gears to grind or major transmission damage can occur. 4. More Heat ExpelledIt?s not uncommon for the transmission system to eliminate some heat that?s noticeable. The problem comes in when you notice an excessive amount of heat pouring off of the transmission. To prevent further damage, you want to shut down the car and figure out if the transmission requires more fluid.You may also smell something burning as the transmission heats up. This problem could stem from an overheating engine and the presence of leaking fluid combined. 5. Vibration/NoiseWhen the fluid level gets low, you are going to see some unusual vibrations occurring, especially when shifting gears. What might have been a smooth operation at one time now creates a driving situation that?s unenjoyable.You could also hear some strange clunking noises. With either instance, it?s important to have the transmission looked at right away. "
how to Prevent Transmission Fluid Leaks ?	"1. Check/Change FluidsBy checking the fluid, you aren?t going to prevent a leak. However, this is one of the most important tasks to ensure a healthy transmission system. Problems start to occur when the fluid gets low, but you can prevent those major issues by keeping the system topped off. Additionally, you want to check on the quality of the fluid. Once it becomes contaminated, it can no longer provide proper lubrication, which could cause failure and a leak. That?s why you should follow the transmission fluid change recommendations set out by the manufacturer. With these two steps alone, you could keep your transmission running its best for 200,000 miles or more. 2. Change Driving HabitsIt makes a big difference in how you drive your vehicle. If you are stopping and speeding up constantly, you are putting more stress on the transmission. Stress can lead to transmission damage, which might cause a leak. If you drive a car with a manual transmission, you have even more to consider. It?s important to know exactly when to change gears. If you shift too early or too late, you put additional pressure on the system, which could also lead to leaks. 3. Repair Problems ImmediatelyIf you notice a transmission leak or other problem, it?s critical that you repair it immediately. The longer problems are allowed to persist, the more trouble you run into. Whenever the system doesn?t have the right amount of transmission fluid, permanent damage can occur. Considering the average cost for transmission replacement is between $1,500 and $4,000, you can?t afford to neglect the care of this vital car part. If you are unsure how to resolve the problem, pay a little extra to have a professional mechanic take a look at it."
Where do transmission fluid leaks most commonly occur?	Transmission fluid leaks mostly occur from the drain plug or a rust hole in the transmission pan. Leaks from the transmission pan gasket or fluid lines are also a common location.
Are transmission leaks easy to fix?	"Transmission leaks can be both easy and difficult to fix. If it?s just a leaking pan plug or gasket, it can be a quick and easy fix. However, if there is damage to the transmission that is causing the leak, it can be very expensive and difficult to fix."
How do I know where my transmission is leaking from?	Finding transmission leaks can be difficult because the fluid gets everywhere and makes a mess. The easiest way to find out where your transmission is leaking is to first clean up the fluid and go for a short test drive. Then lift the car up and look again.
Is a small transmission leak bad?	"All transmission fluid leaks are bad if you never do anything about it. But if it?s only a very small leak, it?s probably not something you need to fix right away, but in the long run, even a small leak can cause damage to both the environment and your car."
Reasons to Replace the Transmission ?	"1. Less ExpensiveYou should almost always replace the transmission if the cost is less than the value of the car. Transmission replacement is expensive, so an older car probably won?t be worth it.However, if you have a vehicle worth $15,000, there?s no reason to avoid the transmission replacement. While you could sell the car, you aren?t going to get nearly the retail value out of it with a failed transmission. 2. Depreciation Already OccurredBecause you aren?t driving a brand-new car, there?s less depreciation occurring. If you keep the vehicle for another year or two, you aren?t going to lose a lot more money off of the value.However, the new car can depreciate more than 22 percent in the first year. That?s a lot of money lost.3. Not Ready for New CarMaybe you just aren?t ready for a new car and payments. That?s okay. You can replace the transmission and buy yourself some more time. After the transmission is replaced, go ahead and start saving for a down payment on the new vehicle. Maybe you will be ready in a year or two.4. Sentimental ReasonsIf there?s an emotional attachment to the car, the resale value won?t mean much to you. It could be that this was your first car, it was given to you by someone you love or it was a dream come true.Either way, if you buy a new one, you would have to part with this friend you?ve grown accustomed to. To keep it running, go ahead and replace the transmission. "
Reasons to Buy a New Car when I have a bad transmission ?	"1. Cost Outweighs ValueThe most logical way to figure out whether to buy a new car is to look at the value. If the retail value is lower than the cost to replace the transmission, there?s no reason to put more money into it.Instead, it?s time to get rid of the money pit and treat yourself to something better. Get what you can from the vehicle and move on. 2. Worried about BreakdownsOlder cars are known for being unpredictable. The broken transmission could be one of many problems you start dealing with.If you aren?t ready to pay for additional repairs, you might want to cut your losses now. Instead of paying for more repairs, you can put the money towards something newer. 3. Tired of the Old CarIf you?ve grown tired of the old car, there?s no reason to stay stuck. Whether the car is embarrassing or it is falling apart around every corner, you deserve something better.Examine your budget to see if you can move on. With flexible auto loans and leasing deals, it?s not difficult to find something for any budget. 4. Ready for an UpgradeNewer cars come with more technology. You can enjoy the latest safety equipment, tech features and entertainment options.Whether you are looking for a backup camera, lane change assist technology or heated seats, these can all be found. Even a used car can offer you some newer technology if you drive something that?s ancient. "
Why is Transmission Replacement So Expensive?	"1. Mechanical ComplexityThe transmission isn?t as simple a system as some others on the vehicle. There are a lot of mechanical parts working together to keep the transmission running.Because of this, it takes special skill to repair or replace a transmission. You won?t be able to spend an hour of labor on a transmission replacement like you would for a brake pad replacement. 2. Make/ModelThe make and model of your vehicle both have a profound impact on how expensive the replacement is. A smaller car might have a transmission that?s less expensive and easier to replace.On the other hand, many luxury cars have expensive transmissions. With that added cost, these usually need a special mechanic for the replacement, too. 3. Age of VehicleIf you drive an older vehicle, it could become difficult to find parts for it. Plus, getting a replacement transmission isn?t always simple.The mechanic might even charge you more for the replacement, especially if they aren?t accustomed to working on something so old. You may even need to wait until the parts are sourced, which adds more downtime. 4. Manual vs. AutomaticIf your car has a manual transmission, the replacement might not be as much as you would think. These are generally the cheapest type of transmissions to replace.However, the automatic transmission has more moving parts and is more expensive. If you drive a high-tech automatic, it?s going to be even more pricey.5. Labor RateYour mechanic?s labor rate depends solely on where you live and their experience. Urban mechanics usually charge a higher price than rural shops. You might want to perform the transmission replacement yourself to save money. Sadly, this isn?t usually a good idea, because it requires special equipment and a lot of expertise. "
What Can Be Done When Car Transmission is Bad ?	"1. Junk the VehicleIf the vehicle is old and it?s not worth much without a working transmission, get ready to junk it. You can call local salvage yards to get the best rate.Most yards will tow the vehicle and pay you a small amount of cash. You could also part out the vehicle yourself, but this takes a lot of time. 2. Sell it/Trade itGo ahead and sell the vehicle the way it is. A mechanic might be interested in fixing it up and selling it.There?s also the option to trade it into the dealership where you will buy a new car. While you won?t get a lot of money for it, there might be enough given to you to put a down payment on something newer. 3. Purchase Used TransmissionYour local mechanic might be able to get a used transmission. This would be the cheapest option, with some models costing less than $1,000 for the parts.However, you probably won?t have any warranty on the used transmission. Plus, you still have to pay the mechanic to put it in. 4. Purchase Rebuilt TransmissionMany transmission shops recommend the rebuilt option. The mechanics take out the transmission and make it like new, replacing all of the vital parts.This could cost $1,500 to $2,500 on average for the transmission, plus the added costs for labor. You may also get a warranty on the repair, depending on where you get the service performed. 5. Purchase Remanufactured TransmissionThe transmission shop might be able to hunt down a remanufactured model. This is like getting a rebuilt transmission, but in this case, it is often performed by the manufacturer. The price goes up a little higher, but you?ll get a better warranty. That?s why this is a good option for newer models that have a failed transmission. 6. Purchase New TransmissionYou also have the option to install a new transmission. This might not be an option on an older vehicle if the transmissions are no longer made.However, this is your most costly option, which is why most people don?t go this route. Still, if you have a luxury vehicle or one that?s worth a lot of money, you might want to know that it is still in factory condition."
Is it worth fixing a transmission on a car?	"It depends on a number of factors, including the make and model of your car, the extent of the damage to your transmission, and the cost of parts and labor. If you have a newer car with a damaged transmission, it is probably worth fixing. However, if you have an older car with extensive transmission damage, it may not be worth fixing. Ultimately, the decision on whether or not to fix your transmission should be based on a cost-benefit analysis."
Is a new transmission better than a rebuilt?	"There is no definitive answer. A rebuilt transmission may be as good as a new one, or it may not. It depends on the quality of the rebuild. A reputable transmission shop will do a good job rebuilding your transmission, but there are also many shops that do poor work. If you choose to have a rebuilt transmission installed, make sure you get a warranty from the shop that did the rebuild."
How much is a car worth that needs a new transmission?	"A car is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. If you need a new transmission, the cost of the repairs could range from $1,500 to $8,000. The average price of a used car is about $15,000, so if you?re selling your car as-is, you can expect to sell it for much less than that.You might be able to get a few thousand dollars for it, but it really depends on the buyer. Some people might not want to buy a car that needs significant repairs, while others might be okay with it, as long as they?re getting a good deal on the price."
How long should a transmission last?	"Many things factor into how long a transmission will last. Driving habits, the way the car is driven, the type of fluid used, and how often it is serviced are all important components of transmission longevity. On average, transmissions will last for about 200,000 miles. However, this number can vary greatly depending on the factors listed above."
What is Riding the Clutch?	"While riding the clutch sounds like it is just some slang used in the automotive field, it is a real condition. When you ride the clutch, you don?t allow the pedal to be released completely and it?s not fully depressed. It?s a method of controlling speed without the use of the brake.People ride the clutch at stop signs or stop lights to avoid pushing in the brake pedal. The clutch pedal is also used to keep the speeds slower than they would be otherwise. It can also mean that you rest your foot on the clutch pedal, which will wear down the clutch over time.There are times when you are going to inadvertently ride the clutch. For example, if you are pulling out of a spot backward, you will need to ride the clutch slightly.If taken care of, the clutch is meant to last. You can avoid repair by using the clutch the way it was intended, which isn?t to ride it. "
Why I Must Avoid Riding the Clutch	"Under normal conditions, pushing the clutch pedal in causes the hydraulics to move the release bearing against the clutch plate. A spring holds that clutch disc up against the flywheel, so all of the tension is released. As the disc floats between the clutch plate and flywheel, you can shift gears.When the clutch isn?t fully disengaged or engaged, the clutch plate slips against the flywheel, operating more like a brake pad. There will also be some slipping while the transmission and engine speeds match up. The less slip there is, the longer your clutch is going to last. On the other hand, leaving your foot on the pedal at all times causes the bearing to rest on the clutch plate splines, which is going to wear out faster. There will also be more wear to the bearing. "
Ways to Preserve Clutch ?	"1. Take Your Foot Off the PedalIf you aren?t paying attention, it?s easy to leave your foot sitting on the clutch pedal. However, this causes you to ride the clutch, sometimes without knowing it. Instead, you want to use the footrest that?s to the left of the pedal when you aren?t using it. If the area near the clutch is cramped, you may need to rest your foot on the floor in front of the pedal instead.It can take some time to get into this new habit. You must consciously choose to take your foot off of the pedal when you are done changing gears. 2. Adjust Driving PositionIf you are positioned too closely to the clutch pedal, it?s going to be difficult to get your foot in its appropriate place. You need to figure out a better way to sit.We recommend moving the seat back to give your legs and feet the room that they need to be comfortable. The more comfortable you are, the easier it will be to place your foot where it belongs. 3. Use Neutral When StoppedIf you have to sit at traffic lights, you might think it makes the most sense to leave the car in first gear with your foot on the brake and clutch down. However, it would be better on the system if you shifted into neutral and took your foot off of the clutch until it is time to move. If necessary, you can also use the handbrake if you will be stationary for a long time. Although, the handbrake is mainly used for parking, as seen in our next tip. 4. Park with HandbrakeYou might not think it matters what gear your car is in when you are parked. Yet, leaving it in gear can lead to wear on the clutch, even with the engine turned off. Instead, you want to use your handbrake when parking. It secures the car the right way. With this method, you take all of the pressure off of the clutch plate while it is not in use. 5. Change Gears QuicklyWhen it comes time to change gears, don?t dawdle. It?s understandable when you are a new manual transmission operator that you would need a little more time to figure everything out. Yet, this isn?t something you want to get used to doing. When you change gears, you don?t want it to take a long time. For every second that the clutch pedal is depressed unnecessarily, you put additional strain on the clutch. What might not seem like a big deal upfront quickly adds up when you think about how many times per drive you do it. Even a couple of seconds can turn into several minutes over the course of the journey. "
How Long Should a Clutch Last?	"There?s no easy answer to this question because it mainly depends on how you drive. If you are hard on your clutch, it could fail prematurely, even as early as 20,000 miles.On the other hand, if you take care of your clutch, it might last more than 150,000 miles. A little care means the clutch could last the lifetime of your vehicle. Considering it costs an average of $750 to $3,000 to replace a clutch, you want to do everything possible to protect it. "
Signs the Clutch is Failing ?	"By paying attention to the signs that the clutch is on its way out, you can have it replaced before you struggle to drive. Here are a few symptoms to pay attention to:Spongy, soft or stiff clutch pedal ? While the feel will change slightly over time, it shouldn?t become dramatic and noticeable.Stuck clutch pedal ? If the pedal gets stuck on the floor, you have no option but to have it looked at.Issues staying in gear ? The clutch will allow the gears to slip when it starts to fail.Burning smell ? A bad clutch isn?t the only thing that can cause a burning smell, but if it?s combined with other symptoms, you might need a new clutch.Grinding noises ? If you notice a grinding sound when you are changing gears, it could mean that the clutch is worn out.By paying attention to what?s happening with the clutch, you can get problems resolved before they get larger. If you have the skills and equipment to replace the clutch at home, you are looking at a lower repair bill. However, if you aren?t qualified, it?s always best to have a professional work on your vehicle."
How Often to Change Differential Fluid ?	"The front differential fluid is usually replaced every 25,000 to 30,000 miles. With the rear differential fluid, you might only need to change it every 30,000 to 60,000 miles. The appropriate schedule for your vehicle can be found in the owner?s manual. The front differential usually shares a housing with the transaxle on a front- or all-wheel-drive vehicle, so it needs to be changed more often than the rear. You will be changing both the differential fluid and transaxle fluid at the same time since they use the same fluid.With either the front or the rear, the changing interval becomes more frequent if you are driving the vehicle harder or in extreme conditions. If you are in doubt, talk to your local mechanic about what?s best for your vehicle. "
What Is Differential Fluid?	"In the front-wheel-drive vehicle, the differential is part of the transmission. However, rear- and four-wheel-drive vehicles have a transmission that?s connected to the drive axles with the driveshaft. The engine torque is then distributed across the axle with the help of the differential, which is a set of gears. This differential is filled with high-viscosity oil, ensuring that the gear remains lubricated. If the fluid isn?t changed when it should be, the fluid starts to break down. As viscosity is lost, the internal gears of the axle become damaged. That?s why you want to change the fluid at regular intervals."
Cost to Change Differential Fluid ?	"It doesn?t cost a lot to change the differential fluid. On average, you might spend between $75 and $175 to have the differential fluid changed, with about $25 to $75 of this for the fluid itself. The rest of the charge would be for the labor unless you can do the job yourself. These estimates relate to changing the fluid in one differential only. If you are driving a four- or all-wheel-drive vehicle, the cost might be double what we?ve estimated. "
Factors Affecting Differential Fluid Change Cost ?	"1. Number of DifferentialsSome vehicles contain a single differential in the back of the vehicle. If you only need to change the fluid in one differential, your cost is going to be much lower than the comparable car with two differentials, one in the front and another in the rear. In some car models, you will also find a type of middle differential that needs fluid changes.Additionally, changing the fluid in the front can be more labor-intensive than in the rear. These parts can be more difficult to access because of how many more components are in the area. If you have to get around the car?s steering rack, you will pay more for labor. 2. Location/Labor RateDepending on where you live, the labor rate is going to be quite different. Some parts of the country have lower labor rates than others. Additionally, the labor rate in the country is usually much lower than those in the city.On top of that, taking your vehicle to the local lube station is going to cost you less than if you visit the dealership. However, you get what you pay for, with less experienced technicians working on your vehicle when you don?t visit a shop with certified techs. The cheapest labor is that which you do on your own. If you have the equipment and expertise to change the differential fluid, you could save some cash. 3. Amount of Gear Oil NeededDifferential oil varies in price just like motor oil does. If you choose synthetic oil, it is going to cost you more. Additionally, there are varying properties and consistency you pay for. You may need a different type of oil for each differential, so pay close attention. An example of this is the F-150 truck. The rear might take one gallon of 75Wx140, while the front only needs a « gallon of 80Wx90.In addition, you need to consider how much differential oil is needed. Each axle holds a differing amount of gear oil. Most systems are going to require a gallon or less during a change. You can get this information from your service manual. "
How is a Differential Fluid Change Performed?	"The differential fluid change is simple to perform on most vehicles. That?s why it?s a common task done at home by the novice mechanic. Here are the traditional steps, although they can differ depending on your vehicle.Check the fluids. Before you get started, it?s best to check the fluid. You want to see if it?s contaminated or needs to be topped off. If the fluid still looks new, there?s no reason to change it prematurely.Check the system for leaks. Before you move on, you want to make sure that there are no leaks in the housing. If there is, you want to fix this before changing the fluid. Otherwise, the new fluid will leak out. You may need to install a new gasket, which isn?t a big deal and is often necessary after many years of use. Drain the system. Remove the drain plug and let the oil run into a catch pan. Wait until all of the fluid has been removed before moving on. You should also inspect the fluid to make sure there?s no sign of metal contamination. Dispose of the old oil at your local mechanic, recycler or auto parts store.Refill the system. Once the system is completely drained, you are ready to refill it. Pour the appropriate amount of new oil into the system and double-check the level. As with any car maintenance task, it?s best to take the vehicle for a test ride after you drain and replace the fluid. This simple step allows you to check that everything is running the way it should. If there?s a burning smell, any weird noises or strange vibrations, there could be larger problems that you need to deal with. Have a professional check the differential if you are unsure how to proceed. "
what is the The Danger of Not Changing Differential Fluid ?	"Many people put off changing the differential fluid because it doesn?t seem important at the time. However, this is a vital maintenance aspect of caring for your vehicle. If you don?t change the fluid at regular intervals, the gears in the axle can become damaged. The seals are also prone to wear because of the old fluid.Additionally, metal can be found in the fluid, which is dangerous. If any metal gets into the gears, they are sure to become damaged. The cost to replace the gears is much more expensive than changing the fluid regularly. "
How can I find out when my vehicle needs a service?	"You can follow the maintenance plan, although a service light on the instrument panel will illuminate when it?s time to get a service. This will typically be around every 6 months or 10,000 km, whichever comes first. "
How can I find out the service history of my SEAT?	"The local retailer may be able to help if your vehicle has been serviced within the SEAT Network. However, they will be unable to access records if your car has been serviced outside of the official network. "
Which oil should I use in my SEAT?	"SEAT recommends Genuine Oil for all our vehicles. Oil is the lifeblood of your car, it helps your car to run smoothly. If the wrong oil is used, the engine is at risk of increased wear and corrosion or even engine seizure due to a formation of blockages.  "
How often do I need to change the oil in my vehicle?	"We recommend changing the oil and filter in Volkswagen vehicles every 6 months or 10,000 kms, whichever occurs first. Always reference your Owner?s Manual for service intervals and schedule maintenance information."
What happens if my car is out of warranty?	For more information about warranty you can know more from here or you can contact your local retailer.
Can a battery be repaired if its energy capacity has declined?	"There are no plans to repair the battery due to reduced capacity with aging. However, in developing the battery, we set a very ambitious goal - namely that the battery should still have 70% of its power after 10 years. The warranty applies to all cars up to 3-years."
Where can I find Warranty information for my SEAT model?	"To find limited warranty information for your vehicle, please refer to your Warranty and Maintenance booklet found in your Owner?s Manual. If you do not have an Owner?s Manual for your vehicle, you can order one in your dealer or check SEAT manual website."
What is covered under a SEAT car warranty?	"A car warranty covers defects, or damage that occurs during normal use, and can't be considered normal wear and tear. It pays to replace defective parts with new or reconditioned parts at SEAT?s discretion. It also covers labour costs.Contact your SEAT official service to know more about it.The warranty of the vehicle is not affected by any change of ownership of the vehicle."
How long is warranty coverage available?	Warranty covers your car for the first 5 years at no extra cost.
What is not covered under warranty?	"While many services fall under the scope of a factory warranty, there are some explicit exclusions laid out. Here are a few examples of things not covered by the SEAT warranty: theft or vandalism damage, normal wear and tear, repairs not made at a SEAT dealership or authorised service center, damage from vehicle misuse, damage from natural disasters, tyres or maintenance services like oil changes.Contact your SEAT official service for more information.The warranty of the vehicle is not affected by any change of ownership of the vehicle."
Is the warranty on my vehicle transferable to a subsequent owner?	You bet. SEAT limited warranties are automatically transferred without cost if the ownership of the vehicle changes while the limited warranties are valid.
I would like to add an aftermarket accessory or part to my vehicle. Will this impact my warranty?	"There are unauthorised spare parts and accessories in the market. SEAT does not warrant these products and is not responsible for their performance, repair, or replacement, or for any damage they may cause to, or adverse effect they may have on, your vehicle.For authorized spare parts and accessories, please visit you nearest SEAT official service."
Where can I get genuine SEAT alloy wheels for my car?	You can find alloy wheels in our spare parts.
Where can I find the recommended tyre pressure for my model?	The recommended tyre pressure for your model can be found in the owner?s manual. 
Is it okay for the tyre pressure to be higher than recommended?	"If the pressure is too high the centre of your tyres will make disproportionate contact with the road, which in turn causes uneven tread wear. "
How do I check my tyre pressure?	"Most petrol stations have measuring equipment. If possible, it?s best to check the pressure when the tyres are cold."
Is my tyre leaking air?	"Tyres lose on average 0.1 PSI of pressure every three months. If your tyres are losing pressure more quickly, you should contact your local retailer."
How can I change a wheel?	Take a look at our ?How to guide? or check your owner?s manual.
How long should the original tyres on my vehicle last?	"Tyres are subject to wear that can vary based on driving habits and road conditions, so there isn't a set timeframe on how long the original tyres should last. To help get the most out of your tyres, please refer to the ?Tyres? section in your Owner?s Manual for proper tire care guidelines."
What offers the Trust Building Measure (TBM) to customers?	"With the Trust Building Measure, SEAT is informing its customers that it would consider any complaints that are established to have arisen as a result of the implementation of the technical measure on vehicles with EA189 type diesel engines and that relate to certain parts of the engine and exhaust treatment system.The Trust Building Measure covers a total of 11 components within the exhaust gas recirculation system, the fuel injection system and the emissions after treatment system: lambda probe, temperature sensor, EGR changeover valve, EGR valve, EGR pressure differential sensor, injector, high pressure pump, fuel rail, pressure control valve, pressure sensor, high pressure pipelines.The Trust Building Measure applies for a period of 24 months from when the vehicle receives the technical measure and only to vehicles with mileage of under 250,000 kilometers at the time the Trust Building Measure is implemented (whichever comes earlier).It also extends to all customers whose eligible vehicles have already been updated.The Trust Building Measure has no bearing on SEAT position that the technical measures do not have any negative effects on the durability of the engine and the after treatment system. The regulators have confirmed that the technical measures meet all legal requirements and have no adverse impact on fuel consumption figures, CO2 emissions figures, engine output, maximum torque and noise emissions. With the Trust Building Measure, SEAT is sending a clear signal that the update has no negative effects on vehicle durability. This measure should serve to strengthen customer confidence in the technical measure and should encourage more customers to have their cars updated.Detailed information is available about the terms and conditions of the Trust Building Measure from all authorized dealers and workshops for their respective vehicle brand, as well as online.Of course all customers can also contact the responsible customer service contact by letter, e-mail or telephone."

You're listening to a real conversation in English with Dialogue Frog. So I have something to complain about today.	Uh oh. What's that?
My car broke.	Yikes.
"Yikes. Yeah. So, the other day I was trying to leave, so I got in my car-"	Mm hm.
"and then when you turn on the car and then you put your foot on the brake, right?"	Right.
"Except the brake pedal didn't work.Uh oh.It just, it just went to the floor."	Yeah.
"Um, so, yeah, my my brake's broken."	That's not good.
No. Yeah. Now I don't have a car.	Do you have a truck? Or an SUV? Or a helicopter?
"I've been meaning to rent one of those. But yeah, they-they were out."	"Yeah, that's sad."
"So, I'm gonna take my car to the repair shop. Um, but it's probably going to be a couple of weeks."	Mm.
A lot of people I guess right now are having car problems.	Yeah.
"Well, you just had your- a car problem too, right?"	"Yeah. Well, the problem was my car's not a helicopter, so."
"Well, that's problem number one."	"That's problem number one, and then, um, yeah, uh, I couldn't get in because the door handle's broken, and I also couldn't get out."
That's a bad situation.	"It-It really was, um, but then it was fixed."
And you did the repair yourself. That's pretty cool.	"Yep. I, uh, I kept thinking, you know, this will be really good practice for when I have a helicopter."
Except it wasn't a helicopter.	No.
"No. Well, this has been another great real conversation in English with Dialogue Frog."	
"Mechanic: Hi, I?m the mechanic. What can I do for you?"	"Amy: My car is making a very weird noise. It sounds like this: gulug, gulug, gulug..."
"Mechanic: Hm, that doesn?t sound good. Where is it coming from?"	"Amy: I?m not sure. When I?m in the car, it sounds like it?s coming from the engine, but when I get out of the car, it sounds like it?s coming from directly under the trunk, maybe the muffler?"
Mechanic: That?s not a noise a muffler would make. Let me take a look. Can you start the car and pop the hood?	Amy: Sure.
"Mechanic: Well, I don?t hear the sound right now, but your battery needs replacing, you have a coolant leak, your carburetor needs adjusting, and your spark plugs are shot. I need to look under the car."	"Amy: Okay, go ahead."
Mechanic: Your brake pads need replacing and your tires need balancing.	Amy: But are any of those problems causing that horrible noise?
"Mechanic: I don?t know. I don?t hear the noise right now, so it?s hard to tell. But that?s all work you need to have done on this car anyway for it to run right. It?s only a matter of time before your car stops working if you don?t take care of those problems."	Amy: I come in with one problem and you find 10 others. I guess you should go ahead. What else can I do?
"Mechanic: Um, buy a bus pass?"	Category: Transportation
How Often Should I Get an Oil Change?	"The consensus agrees that a driver should get an oil change every 3,000 to 7,000 miles or every three months. However, you can always refer to your owner's manual which covers the recommended oil change interval for your specific make and model. Many of today's newer vehicles will actually tell you when they are due for service. Remember: an oil change is essential because it acts as a lubricant for the internal cogs and gears under the hood. Without it, oil can turn into sludge and prohibit your vehicle from operating correctly."
How Often Should I Check My Vehicle's Fluid Levels?	"Aside from engine oil, there are many other fluids that are vital to the health of your vehicle. Some examples include the transmission fluid, brake fluid, engine coolant, and power-steering fluid. Their levels are not only affected by how frequently you drive but extreme temperatures as well. As such, specialists advise checking them at the same time as your oil change or every month or two."
How Often Should I Change My Air Filter?	"Typically, there are two filters in a vehicle. One is for the engine and the other is for the cabin. A dirty filter can prevent airflow, limiting the engine's ability to expend hot air and inhibiting clean air to pass through. How often you need to change it varies, though the conventional timeframe is about 30,000 miles, which is why the best way to determine that it needs a replacement is to check it periodically. Fortunately, replacing a filter is a quick and easy process."
When Should I Replace My Brake Pads?	"On average, brake pads begin to wear out around the 20,000- to 30,000-mile mark, but there are many factors that may impact this figure. Knowing what signs to look out for will therefore prove instrumental in detecting when your brake pads need to be replaced. If you feel your vehicle taking longer to come to a stop or notice a high-pitch screeching or grinding noise when braking, scheduling a checkup is integral. Running with worn brake pads will eventually affect the rotors, which can be a costly repair, so taking a proactive approach will not only keep you safe but save you money as well."
When Should I Replace My Car Battery?	"The standard battery is projected to last three to five years, but variables like hot and cold weather can influence its longevity, so it is best to keep an eye out for signs your battery power is declining. If your headlights and dashboard lights are starting to dim or if your vehicle has difficulty starting, these are clues that your vehicle may be due for a battery replacement."
When Should I Get a Tire Rotation?	"As the main point of contact with the pavement, tires are subject to the most wear and tear. This is especially true if you utilize your vehicle for off-roading or have a two-wheel drive system which puts most of the labor on a specific set of wheels. That being the case, having your tires rotated every six months or around 6,000 to 8,000 miles is a good rule to uphold. Doing so will ensure your tires wear evenly."
How Much Air Pressure Should I Put into My Tires?	"The amount of pressure a tire requires depends on its type and the vehicle. You can find out the optimum air pressure either printed on the door jamb, the side-wall of the tires, or in your owner's manual. Too much pressure can make it difficult for you to maneuver your vehicle while too little pressure can result in a blow-out. You can always speak with a product expert to determine what pressure levels are most appropriate."
What Should I Do When My Check Engine Lights Come On?	"When your check engine light comes on, there could be a number of issues. It could be something basic, like a loose gas cap, or it could be something serious. The best way to ensure that you are safe behind the wheel is to bring your vehicle into our shop for a multi-point inspection. We can find the issue and make you aware of it so you can choose whether or not you want to take the next steps to getting your vehicle back to peak conditions."
What Happens If I Ignore My Low Tire Pressure Warning Light?	"If your tire pressure is low then it can cause uneven wear on your tires. That means that one tire may wear faster than another forcing you to have to replace all of your tires sooner. This can be quite costly. Low tire pressure also puts you at risk of popping your tire sooner. When you drive down the highway you may also feel your vehicle pulling to one side of the road because of this. Also low tire pressure forces your vehicle to use more power to generate the same amount of speed, costing you more gas and money!"
How Often Should I Have My Brakes Checked?	"It is important to have your brakes checked often. Most folks have their brakes checked when they have their tires rotated. One of the mechanics at our service center can check the thickness of your brake pads to ensure that they are running at peak conditions. Your brake pads are essential for maintaining stopping power, so be sure to have them checked every chance that you get."
How Often Should I Have My Brake Pads Replaced?	Your brake pads should be replaced when they are worn down. If you don't replace your brake pads in a timely fashion then it can severely reduce your stopping power. This puts you and folks around you in danger. Not replacing your brake pads also means that your brakes will wear on your brake discs. This will wear them out and cause more costly repairs down the line.
What Type of Oil Filter Do I Need?	"The type of filter that your vehicle needs depends on the type of oil that it needs. Conventional oil needs to be changed about every 3,000 miles and only requires a conventional filter. Synthetic oil, on the other hand, lasts much longer. It can last anywhere between 6,000 and 12,000 miles.  "
What Type of Oil Do I Need?	There a few different types of oil. The best way to check to see what oil your vehicle uses is to check the owner's manual. This will tell you whether your vehicle uses synthetic or conventional oil. Conventional oil wears out sooner and needs to be changed more frequently than synthetic oil so be sure to know the distinction.
What Happens When I Don't Change My Oil?	Oil is the lubricant that keeps your vehicle running. If you choose not to change your oil then it will completely break down and leave a sludge in your vehicle's engine. This will wear your engine over time and cause it to break down much sooner.
Do I Really Need Winter Tires?	"In a one word answer? Yes. Winter tires provide more traction in slippery conditions which can help keep you on the road and away from the side of the road. They also help you get up slippery hills. That means while others are left on the side of the road, you will be cruising to your destination with complete peace of mind."
What's the Point of a Tire Rotation?	"A tire rotation? well? rotates your tires. This causes the wear on your tires to be redistributed to other parts, which will extend the life of your tires. If you don't rotate your tires then the wear on them will be centralized to one spot, forcing it to be replaced sooner. With centralized wear, your tires may even pop sooner so be sure to rotate your tires!"
Why Does My Vehicle Need a Coolant Flush?	"Your coolant is what helps keep your vehicle from overheating. It, just like your vehicle's oil, can break down and cause sludge. This wears down your vehicle and could cause it to overheat. This is not good. A coolant flush allows you to get rid of all of that broken down coolant and replace it with clean coolant. It also allows you to clean out a bit of that broken down coolant, preventing it from causing further damage to your engine ."
How Often Do I Need an MOT?	"An MOT test is an inspection of your vehicle to determine whether your vehicle meets road safety and environmental standards.Legally you must have an MOT carried out annually after the third anniversary of your vehicle?s registration; this means that if you buy a car brand new, you won?t need to take it in for an MOT until it is 3 years old. However, you are still responsible for ensuring it is roadworthy.Check out our MOT checklist 2022 for how to properly prepare for your next MOT."
What Does an MOT Check?	"Throughout the course of an MOT, a number of key components of your vehicle will be checked to ensure they are safe and functioning properly, this includes:LightsHornBatteryWiringSteeringSuspensionBrakesTyresSeatbeltsBodyworkRegistrationSpeedometerFuel SystemExhaust SystemEmissionsMirrorsWipersWindscreen"
What Happens if my Car Fails its MOT?	"If your car fails its MOT, you?ll be given a ?refusal of an MOT test certificate? from the test centre, this will highlight the area where your vehicle failed. These issues will need to be addressed before having your car retested; most test centres offer a free retest if remedial work is carried out with them."
Do Electric Cars Need MOTs?	"Yes, an electric vehicle needs an MOT once they reach 3 years old, just like any other car to ensure it is safe enough to drive. Many components of an electric vehicle?s MOT will be the same as a standard MOT, but elements such as the emissions test will of course be unnecessary."
How Often Should I Take My Car In For Servicing?	"Most car repair specialists (including ourselves) recommend a full service every 12,000 miles or 12 months, whichever comes soonest; you may also consider an interim service once every 6 months or 6,000 miles to ensure optimum performance of your vehicle.It is a good idea to have a full service just before your MOT to get any issues fixed which may result in MOT failure."
What Should I Do If I Get A Flat Tyre?	"In most cases, a flat tyre will mean a tyre change is required. In some cases, it may be that the puncture is not substantial and can be fixed with a puncture repair kit; punctures that can be repaired generally fall in the centre, with damage to the sidewall being irreparable."
What Do The Warning Lights on my Car Mean?	"When a warning light illuminates on your dashboard, it is a sign of a fault with your vehicle. Some are a lot more serious than others so it pays to understand what each one means.Different models of vehicle may have slightly different warning lights, so you should consult your handbook when you spot one. Warning lights that are generally consistent throughout all vehicles include:Car Warning Lights on DashboardSteering System: The steering wheel light will illuminate if you have a problem with your power steering. You should check your steering fluid level when this warning light shows.Oil Pressure Warning: This indicates that your oil level is running low. If the light remains illuminated after topping oil levels up, you should bring your car in to be checked over.Engine Warning: This light illuminates when there is a problem with your engine management system (EMS). If the light remains illuminated, attempt to reset your EMS by switching your engine off for a couple of minutes then start it up again; take your car to the garage if the light remains lit.Brake System: This light should be lit when you have your handbrake on. If the light remains illuminated when your handbrake is off, it could be a sign that your brake fluid is low.Battery: The battery light can mean your battery is running low, your alternator has failed or you have a slack battery or starter terminal. Not addressing this light could you result in your car losing power whilst moving ? very dangerous.For a complete guide to dashboard warning lights, check out our dedicated blog post."
What Do I Do If I Put the Wrong Type of Fuel in My Car?	"This is one of the most bothersome mistakes to make when up your car, and don?t worry, it?s not exclusive to new drivers! If you make this mistake, the most important thing to remember is don?t turn your car on, this will circulate the wrong fuel around your engine; creating a bigger problem.You should call your recovery company and get your car taken to a garage; some breakdown recovery and insurance companies will offer this service as part of your cover."
Can I Do Any Car Maintenance or Repairs Myself?	"Without proper knowledge or equipment, if you don?t understand a problem, it?s best not to try and fix it ? you could end up making it worse! Whilst newer technology in cars has made some maintenance tasks hard to do yourself, there are still a number of regular maintenance tasks you can carry out at home:Ensuring your tyres are pumped up properlyChanging headlights (not always possible especially in newer cars)Windscreen wiper blade replacementTopping up of oils and fluids such as windscreen wiper washBattery change ? always be cautious with thisCommon Vehicle Problems To Be Aware OfIn addition to regular servicing, identifying and dealing with problems as soon as you notice them can save you lots of money in unexpected breakdown and repairs. Here are a few common issues to be aware of:Warning Lights ? These lights appear on your dashboard and can mean anything from low tyre pressure to dying battery; consult your vehicle handbook when you see a light on and get the problem sorted.Brakes Grinding ? Minor brake sounds and underperformance are often ignored, this is very dangerous. If you notice a grinding or dragging sound when you push your brake pedal, it could be that your brake pads have begun to wore away; you should aim to get these replaced as soon as you can.Underperformance ? If you notice your car underperforming or taking longer than usual to start up, it could be a sign that your battery is on its way out."
What exactly is covered?Does it cover breakdown as well as wear and tear?	"Under a ?breakdown? warranty, coverage is extended only to parts that break. Additionally, some ?entry level? contracts don?t cover ABS brakes, so if your vehicle has this feature, you should consider upgrading to this level. And overheating ? regardless of its cause ? isn?t covered in many warranties. Thus, if overheating occurred due to problems with an expensive part such as your radiator, you?d be stuck with a hefty repair bill. Before committing to a warranty, take the time to fully explore the ins and outs of its coverage implications. The distinctions between the various plans might seem slight, but they can prove quite important."
How reliable is the vehicle make and model?	Do your research.
"Is the extended warranty from the factory, the dealer or a third party provider?"	While these aftermarket warranties are cheaper they can be known for shady or dishonest practices.There are differences in deductible ? you can pay per visit or per repair. Be sure you understand the difference before you buy.Some extended warranties are transferable should you decide to sell the car before the end of the warranty. Find out the details.
What do Extended Warranties Cover?	"An extended warranty is like an insurance policy on your car, it is a safeguard against unforeseen repairs. An extended warranty may be purchased at the time you buy your vehicle; it?s also possible to purchase one later. If you?re the type who likes to be prepared for all possibilities, an extended auto warranty may be just what you?re looking for. With the ever-increasing cost of vehicle repairs, these can make a lot of sense.In deciding whether an extended warranty is right for you, and in selecting the best plan, you?ll need to consider some things?To what extent is the car already under warranty and do you plan to keep the car past this period."
What is a Powertrain Warranty?	"A warranty is a statement made by either the seller or the manufacturer of a product or service promising that it will perform in a specified manner for a specific period of time. When shopping for a vehicle you often hear the term ?powertrain warranty?. A powertrain warranty is generally a promise to repair or fix an issue with the parts of the powertrain should a malfunction arise based on the agreement signed by the buyer.The powertrain of a car consists of multiple components?EngineTransmissionDriveshaftAny of the internal workings of the engineSimply put, the powertrain provides power to the car?Power is created by the engine, and then transmitted to the driveshaft through the transmission.The sensors that are generally included in a powertrain warranty provide input and output to and from the powertrain control module (PCM).Some sensors send the computer information, which transcribes the information and sends it to output sensors.They all work together to make the car run cleanly, smoothly and efficiently. The powertrain warranty is often used as a marketing tool. If a mechanical problem arises within the powertrain and it is covered under the terms of the warranty, either the manufacturer or dealership will have to pay for the repairs to the powertrain. What is covered under the warranty, however, varies greatly between vehicles, manufactures and dealerships. When looking to purchase a vehicle you should review this carefully and be sure to understand all of the terms and conditions within the warranty."
How much does a brake job cost?	"The cost of repairing your brakes depends largely on what is wrong with your brakes, and which garage you choose to have them repaired at. There are often costs associated with the initial inspection of your brakes, repairing the damaged brake system, and replacing brake parts. If your entire brake system needs to be replaced, this is commonly a more expensive procedure. It is a common myth that a dealership service department is more expensive than a private garage. However, at our service centre we offer affordable and professional service performed by factory trained technicians."
Why are my brakes vibrating?	"A vibration or pulsating brake pedal is often a symptom of warped rotors (but can also indicate that your vehicle is out of alignment). The vibration can feel similar to the feedback in the brake pedal during a panic stop in a vehicle equipped with anti-lock brakes.It is a sign of warped rotors if the vibration occurs during braking situations when the anti-lock brakes are not engaged. Warped rotors are caused by severe braking for long periods, such as when driving down a steep mountain or when towing. Tremendous amounts of friction are created under these conditions, heating up the rotors and causing them to warp. The vibration is felt because the brake pads are not able to grab the surface evenly. If you drive in these conditions, make sure to stop periodically to allow your brakes to cool off."
Why are my brakes grinding?	"This loud metallic sound means that you have worn down the pads completely. The grinding or growling noise is caused by the two pieces of metal (the disc and the caliper) rubbing together. This can ?score? or scratch your rotors, creating an uneven surface. If this happens, do not be surprised if your mechanic tells you that the brakes and rotors need to be ?turned? (a process that evens out the rotor surface), or even replaced."
Why is the brake pedal sinking to the floor?	"If your brakes are not as responsive as they should be or if the pedal ?sinks? toward the floor, this could be an indication of a leak in the braking system. It could be an air leak (in the brake hose) or a brake fluid leak. One telltale sign of a brake fluid leak is the presence of a small puddle of fluid when the car is parked. Brake fluid looks similar to fresh motor oil, but with a less ?slimy? texture.Another possible problem is the master cylinder. The master cylinder?s cup seals or the cylinder bore itself may be worn. Internal leaking or bypassing cup seals must be considered any time vehicles brake pedal is fading to the floor. This fading pedal with no external leak found is a common master cylinder symptom caused by these cup seals. The result will be a loss of hydraulic pressure. The vehicle will creep at stop lights as the brake pedal fades toward the floorboard."
Why are my brakes pulsing?	"If you experience a pulsing or jerking from the brake, it is far more likely that it was caused by a defect in the brake rotor or drum than from the anti-lock system. A warped rotor or out-of-round drum can cause pronounced pulsating in the brake pedal.The failure of the pad to retract is not uncommon. In older drum systems, the brake shoes are pulled back from the drum by strong springs. But in a disk brake system, the pads are pulled back from the rotor (or disc) by the resiliency of rubber seals. As these seals age or are damaged by contaminated brake fluid, they can fail to do their job. The result is that the pad will ride against the rotor and wear out prematurely.If your rotor is warped, it can cause the pad to wear out even without a failure of the rubber seal. A warped rotor will wobble as it rotates, thereby scraping the pad as it turns. Eventually the pad wears out and the metal backing plate will damage the metal rotor.Get Your Brakes Checked Today.

What is Wrong With My Brakes?	"The brakes are one of the most important parts of your vehicle and they go a long way to keep you safe behind the wheel. However, it?s often hard to determine whether the noises we hear our brakes making are the result of something simple, like air in the brake line, or if they are a warning sign of imminent brake failure.Remember, when your service technician recommends any brake repair, it should be completed as soon as possible to avoid danger. Whether you need a simple brake inspection, brake replacement, brake pad replacement or work on the brake discs, brake pads or rotors, we can help. Our technicians are trained to work on specific makes and models, and our prices are often lower than you can find at an independent garage.For a better idea of what could be causing your brake trouble, read on for answers to common brake questions."
Air Conditioning Not Cold?	"There are several reasons that may explain why your air conditioning system is blowing warm instead of cool air.The first possibility is that there is a refrigerant leak. The leak may be found in the evaporator, condenser or hose in which case you should bring your car to a mechanic to be repaired.Another reason that your air conditioner may not be blowing cool air is because the compressor has gone bad. The compressor pressurizes the refrigerant and pumps it throughout the AC?s necessary components. Because everything revolves around the compressor, if it is faulty then the air conditioning will not work correctly. Usually there will be a loud noise when you attempt to turn on your air conditioner if the compressor is broken.Finally, another problem that may be occurring with your air conditioning system is that there is a clogged orifice tube. This is located between the condenser in the front of the radiator, and the evaporator in the passenger compartment. If there is an obstruction in the tube then it will stop the refrigerant from reaching the evaporator, causing your system to blow warm air."
How Do I Check The Transmission Fluid Level?	"Checking the transmission fluid in your car is a relatively simple procedure and should be done about once per month. To get the most accurate reading you should check the transmission with the engine running and properly warmed up, on a level service.First, remove the dipstick from under the hood (if you are unsure as to where it is located, check your owner?s manual).The handle is usually a bright color (generally yellow or red).Remove the stick, wipe it clean, replace, and then remove it again.There are labels for ?Warm? and ?Cold?- check the warm readings.If it is not full, slowly fill the fluid up a little at a time, and continue to measure with the dipstick.To fill the fluid you should use a funnel and pour it into the hole where you pulled the dipstick.

Time to Replace Your Coolant?

How Do I Check The Coolant Level?	"Checking the coolant level in your car is a fairly simple process. The first thing to remember is to check the coolant level when the car is cold. In most cars today, there is an opaque coolant overflow tank located next to the radiator. The opaque tank is made of white plastic, which allows you to see the inside and be sure that the coolant is at a safe level. You will also find that there are markings on the side to tell you how high or low the level is.You should be checking your coolant level a few times per year to make sure that there are no leaks in your system.If you find that you are low on coolant you will need to top it off. Engines take a 50/50 mixture of coolant and water, which allows your radiator the optimum boiling or freeze protection that your engine needs. You can generally purchase this pre-mixed.To add the coolant, just unscrew the cap of the opaque overflow reservoir and add the mixture until it reaches the full mark.After that, all you need to do is replace the cap, make sure that it is on tight, and you?re ready to roll!Be sure to change your coolant every couple of years (following the manufacturer?s recommendations)."
